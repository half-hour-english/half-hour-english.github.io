This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Pippa.</p><p>Georgie<br>And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?</p><p>Pippa<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?</p><p>Georgie<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.</p><p>Pippa<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650</p><p>Georgie<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.</p><p>Georgie<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.</p><p>Pippa<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.</p><p>Pippa<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.</p><p>Amy, mentor<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]</p><p>Ally<br>Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.</p><p>Georgia<br>I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.</p><p>Ally<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.</p><p>Georgie<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.</p><p>Pippa<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.</p><p>Georgie<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!</p><p>Pippa<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.</p><p>Georgie<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.</p><p>Georgie<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.</p><p>Georgie<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.</p><p>Pippa<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.</p><p>Georgie<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.</p><p>Pippa<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!</p><p>Georgie<br>Oh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website. Visit bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bye for now.</p><p>Georgie<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I’m Pippa.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Pippa。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?<br>我是 Georgie。在这个计划中，我们谈论的是节省食物费用。Pippa，你擅长在食品店省钱吗？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?<br>我觉得我挺好的。我计划我喜欢做什么，这样我就不会在超市浪费钱。你呢，Georgie？</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.<br>我不是很好。我通常在饿的时候去超市，所以我最终买了很多零食。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650<br>哦，这真是个糟糕的主意。好吧，在这个计划中，我们将学习一种在我们吃的食物上省钱的方法。但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Georgie。世界上最昂贵的餐厅被认为是伊维萨岛一家名为 Sublimotion 的餐厅，每晚只有 12 名顾客。但是，在餐厅每人吃一顿饭要多少欧元呢？a） 650 欧元 b） 1,650 欧元 c） 2,650 欧元</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.<br>最昂贵的…我选择 c） 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，英国的食品越来越贵，就像在世界许多地方一样，有些人正在努力负担食品购物的费用。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.<br>但 BBC 世界服务节目 People Fixing the World 一直在了解一个名为“Bags of Taste”的项目，该项目帮助人们节省购买食品的费用，同时改善他们的饮食。Bags of something 是一种非正式的方式，可以表达很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.<br>Bags of Taste 的创始人 Alicia Weston 开始担心，在英国，钱少的人发现很难负担得起健康的饮食。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.<br>贫困人口的饮食习惯最差，而且他们的年龄越来越大。我们知道，饮食是英国健康不平等的最大原因。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.<br>Alicia 发现人们不知道如何烹饪他们想吃的饭菜，而且他们负担不起实验的费用。想象一下，在食材上花了很多钱，然后通过煮得不好或烧焦食物来浪费它们。人们还认为制作健康食品太昂贵且花费太多时间。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.<br>因此，最终，我们能够提出一个基本上可以解决所有这些问题的计划。所以我们现在做的是将所有原料送到他们家门口，因为归根结底，行为改变始于真正改变你在家里的行为。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.<br>Alicia 说，最终，她已经能够想出一个解决方案来帮助人们在健康食品上省钱。我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally，在一系列事件发生之后。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.<br>Alicia 希望解决阻碍人们在预算内吃健康食品的问题。如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它。Alicia 的解决方案包括将食材和食谱交付给人们，然后使用 WhatsApp 群组与参与者交谈。每个 WhatsApp 群组都有一位导师，他会分享烹饪技巧和建议。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.<br>为了让您了解其运作方式，People Fixing the World 的团队在其中一个 “Bags of Taste” WhatsApp 聊天中朗读了一些消息。</p><p>Amy, mentor(Amy，导师)<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]<br>记得把冰箱袋放在冰箱里。我们能不能在星期二晚上之前做一个食谱？我们的第一个食谱 chana masala 是经典之作。它需要一个洋葱，切碎可能会很痛苦。所以，试试我们的方式。[视频发布]</p><p>Ally(盟友)<br>Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.<br>喜欢这种方法 [厨师表情符号]。我第一次切这样的洋葱，它是如此整洁和简单。</p><p>Georgia(格鲁吉亚)<br>I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.<br>我明天要煮我的。期待它。</p><p>Ally(盟友)<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.<br>我已经完成了我的 chana masala。我对辣椒有点太重了。我丈夫喜欢很多香料。所以，下次我会减少这个数字。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.<br>该小组的导师 Amy 将 chana masala 的食谱描述为经典之作。我们称某物为经典，以表示它是众所周知的且质量好。我们也可以将特定的书籍、电影或歌曲描述为经典。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.<br>Amy 发送了一段视频，展示了一种切洋葱的技术，她将其描述为切洋葱很痛苦。如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那就很难做或令人讨厌。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!<br>其中一位参与者 Ally 说，当她制作 chana masala 时，她对辣椒有点粗暴。如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多，所以 Ally 的 chana masala 非常辣！</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.<br>Bags of Taste 帮助人们学习新食谱并烹饪健康食品，而无需花太多钱。在我的问题中，这肯定比在餐厅吃饭便宜得多，Georgie。我问你，在被认为是世界上最昂贵的餐厅 Sublimotion 吃一顿饭要多少钱。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.<br>是的，我说一顿饭是 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.<br>好吧，你错了。它实际上是 1,650 欧元，但我认为这仍然相当昂贵。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.<br>绝对是。还行。让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 bags of 开始，这意味着很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.<br>我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally， after a series of events。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.<br>如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它并找到解决方案。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.<br>如果我们将某样东西（比如食谱）描述为经典，我们的意思是它是众所周知的并且质量好。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.<br>如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那么它就是烦人或难以做到的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!<br>如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多。例如，前几天我做了一些汤，盐有点重 —— 味道很恶心！</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Oh, that’s not very good!

In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.</p><p>Neil<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.</p><p>Beth<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.</p><p>Neil<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.</p><p>Beth<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.</p><p>Neil<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.</p><p>Ruth Alexander<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.</p><p>Neil<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.</p><p>Beth<br>As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?</p><p>Neil<br>I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.</p><p>Beth<br>Varieties of something are different types of it.</p><p>Neil<br>If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.</p><p>Beth<br>If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.</p><p>Neil<br>To give it a go means to try doing something.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable. Once again our six minutes are up. If you’ve enjoyed this programme, why not try practising the new vocabulary you’ve learned with our worksheet – it’s available to download now from our website, bbclearningenglish.com… and you could also try out the quiz while you’re there!

In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.<br>嗯，像这样很多人经常吃的食物，被称为主食。在英国，面包是一种流行的主食，但对于世界大部分地区来说，还有另一种食物是第一大食物：米饭。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.<br>没错。世界上超过一半的人口以大米为主食，尤其是在亚洲。但水稻是一种非常“缺水”的作物，需要大量的水才能生长，由于气候变化造成的干旱和洪水，这正在成为一个问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate.

Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。刚才我提到水稻是一种非常“口渴”的作物 —— 那么种植一公斤水需要多少水呢？是：a） 1,000 到 3,000 升吗？b） 3,000 至 5,000 升？或者，c） 5,000 至 7,000 升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.<br>我要说的是 c） 5,000 到 7,000 升。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。Yvonne Pinto 博士是位于菲律宾的国际水稻研究所（简称 IRRI）的总干事。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》解释了更多关于大米在全球流行的情况：</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto(YvonnePinto医师)<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.<br>世界上 50% 到 56% 的人口以大米为主要主食。现在，大约有 40 亿人，它是真正广泛种植的商品之一，尤其是在南亚和东南亚。但在非洲等大陆，人们对它的需求越来越大，当然也有拉丁美洲和欧洲的大米品种。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.<br>大米是一种商品，一种可以买卖的产品。与其他作物一样，大米也有多种类型，例如糙米、长粒米或印度樟米。今天对水稻的大部分研究都集中在培育能够适应不断变化的环境并在水过多或过少的条件下生长的新品种。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.<br>世界上超过一半的人口吃大米，非洲和欧洲的需求也在不断增长，因此很明显，全世界对大米都有胃口和强烈的愿望。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.<br>那么，是否有可能以更环保的方式种植水稻呢？大米公司 Tilda 的董事 Jean-Philippe Laborde 认为，答案在于一种称为交替湿式干燥（简称 AWD）的新种植技术。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:<br>为了种植水稻，农民会经历淹没田地或稻田的循环，然后稻田干涸，需要再次被淹没。使用 AWD 时，测量管被放置在地下 15 厘米处，以便农民可以检查田地任何部分的水位。通常，水稻需要 25 次洪水和干燥循环才能生长，但使用 AWD 可以减少到 20 次循环，从而为农民节省用水并减少甲烷排放。这是让-菲利普·拉博德 （Jean-Philippe Laborde） 告诉 BBC 国际频道《食物链》的主持人露丝·亚历山大 （Ruth Alexander） 他是如何开始对印度农民进行 AWD 实验的：</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.<br>去年，我们有 1,268 名农民应用了这种 AWD 技术来减少甲烷总排放量。</p><p>Ruth Alexander(露丝·亚历山大)<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?<br>您是如何说服那些农民试一试的？</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.<br>这相当具有挑战性，因为显然，对于农民来说，主要挑战是担心失去收入。他们需要在作物结束时看到切实的结果……他们显然得到了更好的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.<br>许多印度农民都加入了让-菲利普的实验。如果您参与某事，即表示您同意行动计划并参与其中。换句话说，你试一试 – 你尝试做一些事情，看看它是否有效。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?<br>事实证明，新技术产生了切实的结果，结果是真实且可衡量的。使用 AWD，种植水稻所需的水和电量减少，甲烷气体排放量减少，最重要的是，水稻产量增加……对，Neil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.<br>我问种植 1 公斤水需要多少升水，答案是 3,000 到 5,000 升水，非常口渴，但并不像你想象的那么口渴。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从商品开始，一种可以买卖的产品，比如大米。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Varieties of something are different types of it.<br>某物的种类是它的不同类型的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.<br>如果对某样东西有胃口，就会有强烈的愿望或需求。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.<br>如果你同意一个想法或计划，你就同意做某事并参与其中。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To give it a go means to try doing something.<br>To give it a go 的意思是尝试做某事。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>It makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m not surprised. That sounds great.</p><p>Pippa<br>So, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?</p><p>Pippa<br>I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.</p><p>Pippa<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.</p><p>Neil<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.</p><p>Pippa<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.</p><p>Pippa<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.</p><p>Neil<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.</p><p>Pippa<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.</p><p>Neil<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?</p><p>Pippa<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.</p><p>Pippa<br>Nice.</p><p>Neil<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.</p><p>Pippa<br>A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.</p><p>Neil<br>The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.</p><p>Pippa<br>If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.</p><p>Neil<br>A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.</p><p>Pippa<br>And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And I’m Pippa.

Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?<br>我们很快就会听到更多关于 Gross National Happiness 的信息，并学习一些有用的新词汇，但首先 Pippa，我有一个问题要问你。当然，不仅仅是不丹人民想要快乐。事实上，联合国甚至宣布了国际幸福日。但那是什么时候呢？国际幸福日是：a） 3 月 20 日吗？b） 6 月 20 日？c） 11 月 20 日？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.<br>我要说的是 6 月 20 日，因为英国会阳光明媚。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.<br>好的，让我们看看您是否在节目结束时。现在，简而言之，国民幸福总值意味着通过可持续和生态友好型发展来保护不丹的自然环境和文化。不丹政府认为这些目标比不惜一切代价发展经济更重要。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>多年来，不丹一直与外界隔绝 —— 第一批外国游客于 1974 年抵达，而电视直到 1999 年才被引入。不丹国王希望使国家现代化，并赋予其现代技术的好处，但又不损害传统文化，因此他邀请外部专家来发展国民幸福总值的想法。其中一位专家是 Ha Vinh Tho 博士，他在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 的主持人 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈：</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho(HaVinhTho医师)<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.<br>所以，他的想法是：’我们如何在不失去文化、环境和强大的社会结构的情况下实现国家的现代化和开放？因为不丹是亚洲唯一从未被殖民的国家之一，所以它的文化非常完整和充满活力，主要是佛教文化。因此，我们的想法是，国民幸福总值应该是所有政府决策和政策的重点。</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.<br>因此，公民的福祉和幸福成为中心议题。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.<br>不丹拥有强大的社会结构，这意味着社区内部有良好的关系，这些关系将社会团结在一起。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.<br>与其他亚洲国家不同，不丹从未被殖民，因此其佛教文化和传统完好无损 —— 它们是完整且未受破坏的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.<br>因此，不丹人民的幸福成为中心，它成为最重要的事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.<br>不丹对幸福的重视受到了全世界的钦佩，但也存在问题。一个是不丹工人迁移到印度和其他国家，以寻找收入更高的工作和机会，这就是所谓的人才流失。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.<br>因此，在 2023 年，不丹国王宣布了一项耗资数百万美元的项目，名为“正念之城”，这是一座基于精神和环境原则建造的新喜马拉雅城市，全部由可再生能源提供动力。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>来自不丹的 Lhawang Ugyel 博士是该项目的主任，他与 BBC 国际频道的 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈， 调查.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.<br>该项目还旨在扭转不丹的人才流失。</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel(LhawangUgyel医生)<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.<br>目的是让当地人管理整个正念城市，所以从这个意义上说，这也是为了吸引已经离开的移民，他们在国外工作，获得了额外的技能，回到正念城市工作。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.<br>除了是一个未来主义的生态城市外，正念之城还希望通过吸引工人回到不丹来阻止不丹的人才流失。然后，这些当地工人可以通过提升技能来使用他们在国外学到的额外技能。技能提升是通过培训提高工人技能的过程。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.<br>国民幸福总值的概念听起来可能很不寻常，但看到不丹平衡经济增长和人民幸福感是很有趣的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…<br>是的，这是真的 —— 这让我想起了你的问题，尼尔……</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?<br>是的，我问你国际幸福日的日期是哪一天？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.<br>我说那是英国夏天的 6 月 20 日。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.<br>嗯，也许这对南半球的人们更好，因为现在是 3 月 20 日。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Nice.<br>好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.<br>如果您答对了，为什么不试试我们的互动测验，您可以在我们的网站上找到 bbclearningenglish.com！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 modernize 开始，让一些东西更现代，例如通过引入技术。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.<br>一个国家的社会结构是指将一个社区联系在一起的关系。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.<br>形容词 intact 的意思是完整和未损坏。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.<br>如果某件事占据中心位置，它就变得比其他任何事情都重要。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.<br>当大量受过教育和技能娴熟的人离开自己的国家到另一个可以赚更多钱的国家生活和工作时，就会发生人才流失。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!<br>最后，技能提升意味着通过培训和经验来提高工人的技能。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><p><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_001.png" alt="snapshot_001.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_002.png" alt="snapshot_002.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_003.png" alt="snapshot_003.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_004.png" alt="snapshot_004.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_005.png" alt="snapshot_005.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_006.png" alt="snapshot_006.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_007.png" alt="snapshot_007.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_008.png" alt="snapshot_008.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_009.png" alt="snapshot_009.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_010.png" alt="snapshot_010.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_011.png" alt="snapshot_011.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_012.png" alt="snapshot_012.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_013.png" alt="snapshot_013.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_014.png" alt="snapshot_014.png"></p><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="modernise"><a href="#modernise" class="headerlink" title="modernise"></a>modernise</h4><p>make more modern, for example through introducing new technology<br>现代化<br>使现代化，例如通过引进新技术<br>The government invested heavily to modernise the country’s transport infrastructure.<br>政府投入巨资来实现该国交通基础设施的现代化。</p><h4 id="social-fabric"><a href="#social-fabric" class="headerlink" title="social fabric"></a>social fabric</h4><p>community relationships which connect members of a society<br>社会结构<br>连接社会成员的社群关系<br>Immigration can weaken the social fabric of a community.<br>移民会削弱社区的社会结构。</p><h4 id="intact"><a href="#intact" class="headerlink" title="intact"></a>intact</h4><p>complete and untouched<br>完好无损<br>完整且未被触及<br>The church was destroyed during the war, but the altar somehow remained intact.<br>教堂在战争中被摧毁，但祭坛不知何故完好无损。</p><h4 id="take-centre-stage"><a href="#take-centre-stage" class="headerlink" title="take centre stage"></a>take centre stage</h4><p>become more important than anything else<br>成为焦点<br>变得比任何事情都重要<br>The issue of climate change is likely to take centre stage in the upcoming summit.<br>气候变化问题很可能在即将举行的峰会上成为焦点。</p><h4 id="brain-drain"><a href="#brain-drain" class="headerlink" title="brain drain"></a>brain drain</h4><p>when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work abroad where they can earn more money<br>人才流失<br>大量受过良好教育和拥有技能的人离开自己的国家，到国外生活和工作，在那里他们可以赚到更多的钱<br>The country is suffering a serious brain drain.<br>这个国家正遭受严重的人才流失。</p><h4 id="upskilling"><a href="#upskilling" class="headerlink" title="upskilling"></a>upskilling</h4><p>improving workers’ skills by giving them additional training<br>技能提升<br>通过提供额外的培训来提高工人的技能<br>The company invests heavily in upskilling its workforce.<br>该公司在提升员工技能方面投入巨资。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.</p><p>Neil<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.</p><p>Beth<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say polio.</p><p>Neil<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.</p><p>Beth<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.</p><p>Neil<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.</p><p>Beth<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.</p><p>Neil<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.</p><p>Beth<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.</p><p>Neil<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.</p><p>Beth<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?</p><p>Beth<br>And I said polio. Was I right?</p><p>Neil<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.</p><p>Beth<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.</p><p>Beth<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.</p><p>Neil<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon. Bye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.<br>我是贝丝。在我们的一生中，每 5 人中就有 1 人会受到癌症的影响，癌症是一种细胞不受控制地生长并导致体内肿瘤的疾病。肿瘤可以是良性的，即非癌性，也可以是恶性的，即癌性，到 2022 年，全球估计有 970 万人死于恶性癌症。但在这个节目中，我们将专注于一些好消息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.<br>疫苗是通过使人体免受某种疾病的免疫来保护人体的药物。现在，在开发一种名为 mRNA 的新疫苗方面，出现了一个突然而重要的发现 —— 一个突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>那么，癌症疫苗会很快成为现实吗？这就是我们将要发现的，以及学习一些有用的新单词和短语。请记住，如果您喜欢听六分钟英语并想同时阅读，您可以在我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com 上找到该节目的文字记录。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?<br>现在我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。我们已经提到了一些最新的疫苗，但第一个成功的疫苗治疗了哪种疾病？是：a） 流感？b） 脊髓灰质炎？或 c） 天花？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say polio.<br>我要说的是小儿麻痹症。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>还行！好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。您可能想知道为什么身体的免疫系统不自动对抗癌症。原因是癌症有巧妙的方式躲避我们的自然防御，正如田纳西州肿瘤学研究主任 Meredith McKean 博士向 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 解释的那样：</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean(MeredithMcKean博士)<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.<br>有许多研究表明，癌症已经开发出不同的技术，能够发出信号或蛋白质，本质上是在癌细胞的表面，告诉免疫系统，’走开！这里没什么可看的！因此，它实际上是劫持了这些受体，基本上是告诉免疫系统放松刹车，在对抗癌症方面更加积极。这确实让免疫疗法在过去十年中取得了突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.<br>McKean 博士说，许多研究已经证明了癌症是如何扩散的。她使用短语 a number of 来表示几个，但这也使她的说法更有说服力，因为当然，几项研究总比一项好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.<br>癌细胞通过假装是健康细胞来关闭免疫系统。就好像他们在说 Nothing to see here！– 一个非正式的短语，可以用来鼓励人们以俏皮的方式移动或移开某物，或者掩盖某物。例如，犯罪现场的警察可能会说，“这里没什么可看的！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.<br>所以，换句话说，癌症劫持了健康的细胞 —— 它控制了不属于它的东西，并利用它为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>那么，疫苗将如何改变现状呢？好吧，现有的治疗方法，如化疗，积极地针对癌症，但也攻击健康组织，产生令人不快的副作用。另一方面，新的突破性疫苗重新训练免疫系统识别癌细胞并自然地消除这些细胞 —— 即使是已经患有这种疾病的患者。以下是德克萨斯州安德森癌症中心的爱德华多·桑切斯 （Eduardo Sanchez） 教授向 BBC 国际频道的 The Inquiry 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez(EduardoSanchez教授)<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.<br>基本上，癌细胞在告诉免疫系统，’不要攻击我，不要吃我’，对吧？免疫系统已经忘记了如何识别这些癌细胞，对识别癌细胞产生的那些畸变变得盲目，我们想用疫苗做的是重新教育免疫系统。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.<br>在癌症患者中，免疫系统对癌变的生长视而不见 —— 它完全没有注意到它们或意识到它们的危险，因此疫苗以不同的方式重新教育免疫系统或教它行为。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.<br>回顾一下，一些癌症治疗通过疏通我们受阻的自然防御来起作用，而疫苗则重新训练免疫系统以自然地发现和攻击癌细胞。由于这两种方法完全不同，因此它们可以一起使用，也可以单独使用。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?<br>所以，回答我最初的问题，Neil，癌症疫苗可能并不遥远。但是你的问题怎么样 —— 现在是不是该透露答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?<br>我问哪种疾病首先被疫苗成功治疗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I said polio. Was I right?<br>我说的是小儿麻痹症。我是对的吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.<br>恐怕你错了。正确的选项是 C，即天花。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从突破开始，一个突然的、戏剧性的和重要的发现。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.<br>许多事物意味着几个或许多，可以增加你所说的可信度。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.<br>短语 Nothing to see here！用于阻止人们注意或过于仔细地观察某物，或将他们移开。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.<br>如果你劫持了什么东西，你就利用了不属于你的东西来为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.<br>对某事视而不见意味着没有注意到它或将其视为威胁。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.</p><p>Beth<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Haleigh Hurst<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.</p><p>Beth<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.</p><p>Neil<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.</p><p>Beth<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Maanvi Sharma<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.</p><p>Neil<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.</p><p>Beth<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.</p><p>Beth<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.</p><p>Neil<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.</p><p>Beth<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.</p><p>Neil<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!</p><p>Neil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.<br>我是贝丝。在这个节目中，我们将讨论社交媒体在年轻人生活中的积极和消极因素。这是目前一个非常热门的话题，因为澳大利亚正在讨论一项限制 16 岁以下儿童使用社交媒体的新法律。Neil，告诉我在你的生活中拥有社交媒体的一件好事和一件坏事。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.<br>嗯，一件好事是我可以看到住在很远的朋友在做什么，一件坏事是它真的会让人上瘾，而且会浪费大量时间。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>嗯，Neil 听听男性的观点很有趣，因为当谈到网络欺凌等问题时，受影响最大的往往是年轻女性，所以很快我们就会听到不同国家&#x2F;地区的女性讲述她们的在线经历。请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到所有词汇和工作表，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。2024 年，世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个？是：a） Facebook？b） Instagram？或 c） TikTok？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.<br>哦，我要说的是 TikTok。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，让我们从社交媒体的积极一面开始。作为俄克拉荷马大学（Oklahoma University）的一名政治专业学生，21岁的哈利·赫斯特（Haleigh Hurst）参加了2024年美国总统大选。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 解释了社交媒体的一个好处：</p><p>Haleigh Hurst(哈利·赫斯特)<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.<br>我确实认为社交媒体在教育年轻选民了解不同的政策和不同的竞选人方面发挥了巨大作用。我知道特朗普最近说，他心里对 TikTok 情有独钟。随着社交媒体的发展，它引发了更多的辩论。我想我们这一代人也见过很多高潮的事情发生。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.<br>Haleigh 认为社交媒体的一个好处是它引发了辩论和对话 —— 它导致辩论开始。她评论说唐纳德·特朗普是社交媒体的粉丝，他说他对TikTok情有独钟。如果你对某事或某人情有独钟，你会感到深情和喜欢它；你很喜欢它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.<br>但当然，这并不是故事的全部。越来越多的年轻女性报告了社交媒体对她们生活的负面影响，以及她们在网上显得“完美”的压力，尤其是来自男性的压力。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>Maanvi Sharma 现年 28 岁，是一名女商人和模特，在 Instagram 上拥有大量粉丝，居住在印度德里。Kemi Adeyemi 是一位来自尼日利亚拉各斯的 26 岁旅游博主。这两位年轻女性都在 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 中讨论了这些社交媒体上的担忧：</p><p>Maanvi Sharma(马安维·夏尔马)<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…<br>…你正在约会的人，他们可能会因为社交媒体而离开你。他们可能会认为你不适合，你知道的，像……你不能因为你在社交媒体上而成为一个好的伙伴，因为你被很多人看着，他们对此感到有点害怕……“你知道吗，我们看到了你的女朋友 —— 哦，我的天哪！她穿着这个，天哪！但它正在影响我的个人生活……</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi(凯米·阿德耶米)<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.<br>有些人或有些人，他们希望你缩小自己，这样他们就可以成为更大的人。他们可以听你的朋友怎么说你，你的家人怎么说你，但他们无法站出来为你说，’哦，我认识这个人。我相信她不是因为其他原因做这些事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.<br>Maanvi 认为一些男人被她在 Instagram 上的受欢迎程度吓倒了。Intimidated 的意思是因为你缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。她感觉到人们会八卦她的帖子和照片，使用诸如“哦，我的天哪”和“哦，我的上帝”之类的表达来表达他们的震惊或惊讶。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.<br>凯米同意。她说，在社交媒体上，有些人希望她缩小自己，这句话的意思是你没有充分利用自己的潜力，以避免让人们感到不舒服，或者为了融入。当她在网上被欺负时，凯米说这些人不会为她挺身而出。To stand up for someone 的意思是为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持。我认为你是时候透露你问题的答案了，Neil。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?<br>我问 2024 年世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个 —— Facebook、Instagram 还是 TikTok？你怎么说贝丝？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>TikTok.<br>TikTok的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.<br>恐怕你错了。它是 Facebook，拥有超过 30 亿的固定用户。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从动词 spark 开始，意思是导致某事开始发生，例如辩论或争论。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.<br>如果你对某人情有独钟，你就会对他们产生感情；你很喜欢他们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.<br>To be intimidated 的意思是因为您对某种情况缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.<br>“Oh my gosh！”和“Oh my God！”这些表达是对强烈情绪的感叹，如震惊、惊讶、愤怒或不相信。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.<br>如果你缩小自己，你就会让自己变得更小，并且不会充分利用你的潜力来让别人感到舒适，或者为了适应他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!<br>最后，To stand up for someone 的意思是大声疾呼地为遭受霸凌的人辩护。我们的时间又一次到了！但是，如果您准备好了解更多，请前往 BBC Learning English 网站尝试带有此计划的测验工作表！期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><p><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_001.png" alt="snapshot_001.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_002.png" alt="snapshot_002.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_003.png" alt="snapshot_003.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_004.png" alt="snapshot_004.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_005.png" alt="snapshot_005.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_006.png" alt="snapshot_006.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_007.png" alt="snapshot_007.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_008.png" alt="snapshot_008.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_009.png" alt="snapshot_009.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_010.png" alt="snapshot_010.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_011.png" alt="snapshot_011.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_012.png" alt="snapshot_012.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_013.png" alt="snapshot_013.png"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_014.png" alt="snapshot_014.png"></p><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="a-soft-spot"><a href="#a-soft-spot" class="headerlink" title="a soft spot"></a>a soft spot</h4><p>an affectionate liking or fondness for someone or something<br>对…特别偏爱<br>对某人或某事物怀有深厚的喜爱或偏爱<br>He has a soft spot for his niece.<br>他特别疼爱他的侄女。</p><h4 id="spark"><a href="#spark" class="headerlink" title="spark"></a>spark</h4><p>cause (a debate, conversation, fight etc) to start happening<br>引发<br>引起（一场辩论、谈话、争吵等）的发生<br>Her speech sparked a heated debate.<br>她的讲话引发了一场激烈的辩论。</p><h4 id="intimidated"><a href="#intimidated" class="headerlink" title="intimidated"></a>intimidated</h4><p>frightened or nervous because of a lack of confidence<br>受恐吓的<br>由于缺乏自信而感到害怕或紧张<br>I was intimidated by his aggressive manner.<br>他的咄咄逼人的态度让我感到害怕。</p><h4 id="Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God"><a href="#Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God" class="headerlink" title="Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!"></a>Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!</h4><p>expression of feelings such as shock, surprise, anger, disbelief<br>我的天哪！<br>表达震惊、惊讶、愤怒、不相信等情绪的感叹词<br>Oh my gosh, did you see that car crash?<br>我的天哪，你看到那场车祸了吗？</p><h4 id="shrink-yourself"><a href="#shrink-yourself" class="headerlink" title="shrink yourself"></a>shrink yourself</h4><p>make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable<br>缩小自己<br>为了让别人感到舒服而让自己变得渺小，不发挥全部潜能<br>Don’t shrink yourself; let your talent shine.<br>别妄自菲薄；让你的才能闪光。</p><h4 id="stand-up-for-someone"><a href="#stand-up-for-someone" class="headerlink" title="stand up for (someone)"></a>stand up for (someone)</h4><p>be vocal in defending or supporting a person who is being criticised or bullied<br>为…辩护<br>大声疾呼为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持<br>She always stands up for the underdog.<br>她总是为弱者辩护。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.</p><p>Beth<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Phil<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?</p><p>Beth<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.</p><p>Phil<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.</p><p>Megan Lawton<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.</p><p>Beth<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.</p><p>Phil<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.</p><p>Beth<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:</p><p>Dr William Brady<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.</p><p>Phil<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.</p><p>Beth<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.</p><p>Phil<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.</p><p>Phil<br>I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>It is, yes.</p><p>Phil<br>Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.</p><p>Beth<br>The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.</p><p>Phil<br>To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.</p><p>Phil<br>Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Phil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Phil.<br>您好，这里是 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语，我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.<br>如果你使用互联网，而且几乎每个人都使用互联网，你可能读过这样的头条新闻：你不会相信这位名人做了什么整容手术！像这样的标题被称为点击诱饵，用来吸引你的注意力并让你阅读更多内容。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>但现在，一种称为愤怒诱饵的新趋势正在社交媒体上传播。愤怒诱饵是旨在让您生气或愤怒的在线内容。在这个节目中，我们将探索愤怒诱饵的趋势，并且像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些都可以在我们的网站上找到，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?<br>很好，但首先是我的问题，贝丝，这是关于我们一直在使用的两个术语：“点击诱饵”和“愤怒诱饵”。两者都包含“诱饵”一词，但它的实际含义是什么？诱饵是否：a） 强烈的愤怒感？b） 用钩子钓鱼或动物的食物？c） 一个计算机软件？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.<br>我相当有信心它是 b） – 食物上钩。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。愤怒诱饵的工作原理是这样的：创作者在网上发布挑衅性内容，可能是一条消息，或者一个视频。人们看到它，感到愤怒，并愤怒地评论。其他人看到它、喜欢它并分享它。无论哪种方式，内容都会引起兴趣，增加互联网流量并为创作者赚钱。以下是营销策略师 Andrea Jones 向 BBC 世界服务节目主持人 Megan Lawton 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.<br>他们创建的内容越多，他们获得的参与度就越高，他们获得的报酬就越多。所以他们会做任何事情……一些创作者会不惜一切代价获得更多观看次数，因为他们获得的观看次数越多，他们获得的报酬就越多，即使这些观看次数是负面的或煽动人们的愤怒和愤怒。</p><p>Megan Lawton(梅根·劳顿)<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]<br>Andrea，愤怒诱饵与点击诱饵或其他在线策略有何不同？[…]</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.<br>作为一名营销人员，我总是，你知道的，指导我的客户，并与他们讨论在他们的营销中使用钩子，对吧？我认为 hook 和 rage bait 甚至它失传已久的表亲 clickbait 内容之间的区别……当我们考虑一个钩子时，对我来说，钩子准确地反映了该内容中的内容，它来自一个信任的地方，而愤怒诱饵的内容则被设计为纵性的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.<br>Andrea 说，帖子得到的反应越多，创作者赚的钱就越多，即使这些反应是仇恨的。她使用结构，一件事发生得越多，其他事情发生得越多，来表明当一件事反复发生时，另一件事也会因此而增加。例如，你练习英语的次数越多，你的进步就越大。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.<br>这些内容旨在煽动愤怒 —— 鼓励令人不快或暴力的反应，这并不重要。这就是为什么 Andrea 认为愤怒诱饵比点击诱饵更糟糕。虽然点击诱饵的内容更真实，但愤怒诱饵是纵性的，这意味着它试图影响某事以使其自身有利。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:<br>所以，不难看出为什么很多人认为愤怒诱饵是有毒的。所以，如果你想知道人们为什么首先会做出反应，请听听威廉·布雷迪博士向 BBC 世界服务部《商业日报》解释愤怒诱饵背后的心理学：</p><p>Dr William Brady(WilliamBrady博士)<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.<br>如果你是一个有影响力的人，你想弄清楚，’好吧，我如何在我的内容上获得更多的眼球？嗯，你需要利用我们在心理学中存在的那些偏见，因为那是我们将更加关注的内容。反过来，这就是算法将放大的内容，这最终意味着更多的广告收入。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.<br>有影响力的人希望他们的内容有更多的眼球 —— 更多的人查看他们的网站或社交媒体帖子 —— 并利用人类心理学来做到这一点。从心理学上讲，我们都有偏见 – 感觉 – 这些偏见通常是无意识的，要么支持要么反对某个想法或一群人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.<br>偏见是情绪化的，由于倾听我们的情绪对人类物种的进化至关重要，创作者知道激发我们的情绪会吸引我们的注意力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.<br>那么，可以做些什么来对抗愤怒诱饵呢？好吧，在做出反应之前，我们都可以花点时间思考一下。请记住，分享一些离谱的东西可能会让事情变得更糟，同时也会让创作者变得更富有。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.<br>好的，Phil，让我们揭示你问题的答案。你问我什么是“诱饵”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?<br>我做了。正确答案是 b） 把食物挂在钩子上以捕捉鱼或动物，贝丝，你不是这么说的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yes.<br>是的，是的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.<br>又对了！好，让我们回顾一下我们在该计划中学到的词汇，从愤怒诱饵开始，社交媒体内容旨在激起愤怒，从而鼓励人们参与其中。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.<br>结构，越多…越…描述一件事反复发生导致另一件事也发生的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.<br>To agite someone 的意思是鼓励他们做或感受不愉快或暴力的事情。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.<br>形容词 manipulative 描述了试图影响或控制某人以为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.<br>Eyeballs 是一个非正式词，指的是观看特定网站或电视节目的人数。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!<br>最后，偏见是感觉，通常是无意识的，支持或反对一个想法或一群人。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p><p><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" alt="幻灯片1.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" alt="幻灯片2.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" alt="幻灯片3.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" alt="幻灯片4.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" alt="幻灯片5.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" alt="幻灯片6.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" alt="幻灯片7.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" alt="幻灯片8.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" alt="幻灯片9.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" alt="幻灯片10.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" alt="幻灯片11.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" alt="幻灯片12.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" alt="幻灯片13.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" alt="幻灯片14.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8715.PNG" alt="幻灯片15.PNG"></p><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="rage-bait"><a href="#rage-bait" class="headerlink" title="rage bait"></a>rage bait</h4><p>social media content designed to provoke an emotional reaction so that people engage with the content thereby generating income for the online creator<br>愤怒诱饵<br>旨在激起情绪反应的社交媒体内容，以便人们参与其中，从而为网络创作者带来收入。<br>The inflammatory post was pure rage bait, designed to maximize engagement and profit.<br>煽动性的帖子纯粹是愤怒诱饵，旨在最大限度地提高参与度和利润。</p><h4 id="the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…"><a href="#the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…" class="headerlink" title="the more (X)… the more (Y)…"></a>the more (X)… the more (Y)…</h4><p>as one thing (X) happens repeatedly, another thing (Y) happens more as a result<br>越…越…<br>一件事情(X)反复发生，另一件事情(Y)的结果就越多。<br>The more he studied, the more confident he became in his abilities.<br>他学习越多，就越自信。</p><h4 id="incite"><a href="#incite" class="headerlink" title="incite"></a>incite</h4><p>encourage someone to do or feel something unpleasant or violent; stir up; provoke; rouse<br>煽动<br>鼓励某人做或感受令人不快或暴力的事情；煽动；挑衅；激起。<br>His inflammatory speech incited the mob to riot.<br>他煽动性的演讲煽动了暴民暴动。</p><h4 id="manipulative"><a href="#manipulative" class="headerlink" title="manipulative"></a>manipulative</h4><p>trying to influence or control someone to your advantage<br>操纵性的<br>试图利用他人达到自己的目的。<br>Her manipulative tactics alienated her friends.<br>她操纵性的策略使她疏远了朋友。</p><h4 id="eyeballs"><a href="#eyeballs" class="headerlink" title="eyeballs"></a>eyeballs</h4><p>the number of people viewing a particular website, television programme etc.<br>眼球数<br>观看特定网站、电视节目等的人数。<br>The new campaign attracted millions of eyeballs.<br>这项新活动吸引了数百万眼球。</p><h4 id="biases"><a href="#biases" class="headerlink" title="biases"></a>biases</h4><p>feelings, often hidden or unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people<br>偏见<br>经常是隐藏的或无意识的，对某种想法或人群的偏好或偏见。<br>Unconscious biases can significantly affect decision-making.<br>无意识的偏见会严重影响决策。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.</p><p>Beth<br>Very nice!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:</p><p>Marnie Chesterton<br>My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!</p><p>Phil<br>Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.</p><p>Beth<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.</p><p>Phil<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.</p><p>Beth<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.</p><p>Phil<br>Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.</p><p>Beth<br>Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?</p><p>Phil<br>Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.</p><p>Beth<br>It is, yeah!</p><p>Phil<br>Well done!</p><p>Beth<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.</p><p>Phil<br>The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.</p><p>Beth<br>When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.</p><p>Phil<br>The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.</p><p>Beth<br>If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal.

Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?<br>我是贝丝。Phil，是什么让家对你来说很特别？也许是睡在自己的床上，窗外的风景，或者是心爱的家庭宠物。是什么让你感觉像在家一样，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.<br>你知道吗？我想就是在我的沙发上，在我的客厅里放松。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Very nice!<br>很好！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:<br>好吧，你可能没有意识到，但对于你的大脑来说，家最强的标志之一是气味。听听 BBC 主持人 Marnie Chesterton 和 Tristan Ahtone 描述给他们带来家的感觉的气味：</p><p>Marnie Chesterton(玛妮·切斯特顿)<br>My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.<br>我爷爷的房子闻起来有松树的味道，还有潮湿和发霉的书籍的味道。</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.<br>我知道我妈妈的香水，我爸爸最喜欢的肥皂。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!<br>在这个节目中，我们将找出为什么我们的嗅觉对家的感觉如此重要，即使我们没有注意到它。与往常一样，我们将介绍一些有用的新词汇，如果您 bbclearningenglish.com 访问我们的网站，您会找到该程序的文字记录，供您在收听时阅读，并且还有一个免费的工作表！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?<br>好主意，贝丝！但现在是我提问的时候了。嗅觉非常强大，但并不是每个人都有。一小部分人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。那么，根据雷丁大学的研究，没有嗅觉的人占百分之几呢？是：a） 2%吗？b） 5%？或者，c） 7%？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.<br>哦，我要说 b） 5%。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:<br>好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。你有没有放假回家，注意到家里有一股奇怪的气味？如果你有，别担心 —— 这还不错，事实上有科学原因，正如科学作家特里斯坦·阿通 （Tristan Ahtone） 对 BBC 国际服务节目《意想不到的元素》所解释的那样：</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.<br>我一直在想的一件事是，每栋房子或每个家庭都有一股气味。当你从长途旅行回来时，你可能真的会在自己的家里注意到这一点，当你踏入前门时，东西闻起来有点奇怪。虽然您的房子很有可能因为已经关闭了几周而闻起来很奇怪，但您也有可能闻到家通常闻起来的味道，但当您在那里时，您只是没有注意到它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.<br>特里斯坦说，当你离开后回到家时，你的房子很有可能闻起来很奇怪，这个形容词的意思是奇怪或不寻常。如果你说某事发生的可能性很大，你的意思是它发生的可能性很高。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:<br>事实是，每个家都有气味，尽管我们已经习惯了，但我们通常不会注意到。当我们吸气时，鼻子中的受体细胞会检测到空气中的分子，并将它们发送到大脑中的嗅觉器官。这些分析气味是否存在危险。你闻不到自己家的原因是它对你没有威胁。这是科学作家 Tristan Ahtone 再次向 BBC 国际服务节目 Unexpected Elements 解释更多内容：</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.<br>好吧，通过过滤掉常见的非威胁性气味，可以更容易地检测到可能危险的异常事物。所以，例如，如果你忘记了吐司，它开始燃烧，你通常会很快闻到这种气味，因为这是你所处环境的变化。然后，您大脑的其他部分开始发挥作用，将烟味理解为潜在的伤害或威胁。但是，即使我们无法闻到自己家的气味，它们的气味仍然很重要，因为它与我们对舒适和安全的认识纠缠在一起。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.<br>通过过滤掉熟悉的气味，我们的大脑能够检测到其他不寻常、不寻常或不常见且可能很危险的气味。To filter something out 的意思是从其他事物中删除或分离不需要的事物。例如，过滤掉家的气味意味着我们会注意到烤面包燃烧的气味或其他气味，提醒我们可能的危险。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.<br>尽管我们通常不会注意到家中的气味 —— 特殊的气味 —— 但它仍然对大脑处理记忆和情感的边缘系统产生影响。这就解释了为什么气味对我们的感受有如此强烈的影响，以及为什么我们在家里感到舒适和安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>对，Phil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.<br>是的，它是。我问你有多少百分比的人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。答案是 b） 5%，我想这就是你说的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yeah!<br>是的，是的！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well done!<br>干的好！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.<br>好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从嗅觉丧失开始，意思是没有嗅觉或嗅觉有限。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.<br>形容词 weird 的意思是奇怪、奇怪或奇异。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.<br>当有人说某事很有可能发生时，他们的意思是它很可能会发生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.<br>短语 out of the ordinary 的意思是不寻常、不常见或例外。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.<br>如果你过滤掉一些东西，你就会从物质中去除或分离不需要的东西。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal. Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you enjoyed listening to this programme, you’ll find many more, along with a worksheet with a quiz you can try, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

I’m Pippa.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>Now, Neil, have you ever wanted to be a musician?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh yes, Pippa, I still want to be a musician. I’ve been playing my guitar since I was 14.</p><p>Pippa<br>Wow. Well, maybe one day you’ll, you’ll manage it. Who knows?</p><p>Neil<br>What about you?</p><p>Pippa<br>I don’t think I’d like to be a musician. I think it would be a bit stressful. Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful.</p><p>Neil<br>Yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too.</p><p>Pippa<br>But first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley</p><p>Neil<br>Oh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.</p><p>Neil<br>This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.</p><p>Neil<br>When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.</p><p>Neil<br>The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.</p><p>Pippa<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.</p><p>Pippa<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.</p><p>Neil<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Of course I would.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall</p><p>Neil<br>Wow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com. We’ll also put a link in the notes below this episode!</p><p>Neil<br>OK. So, what about your question, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts? The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley? And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18.</p><p>Neil<br>Really? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well.</p><p>Pippa<br>OK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Songwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Neil<br>A bunch of people is a group of people.</p><p>Pippa<br>The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.</p><p>Pippa<br>Your main earner is your main source of income.</p><p>Neil<br>Gigs are musical concerts.</p><p>Pippa<br>And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.<br>乐队中的老人们会演奏 1970 年代的音乐，贝利说他们把她放在自己的羽翼下。如果你把某人放在你的羽翼下，你就会决定保护他们或引导他们。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.<br>让我们来认识另一位音乐家 Josh。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.<br>所以，我在大约 13 岁的时候学会了我的第一首正式的吉他歌曲。我真的在我能做到的那一刻就开始表演了。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.<br>Josh 住在伦敦，是一名街头艺人。这意味着他在街上或公共场所表演以赚钱。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.<br>街头表演是音乐家赚钱和向更多人表演的常见方式。正如 Josh 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中所说的那样，它可以帮助音乐家获得新的机会。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.<br>这有点像我的主要收入来源，让我在过去十年左右的时间里一直坚持下去。从那时起，它为我带来了各种不同的机会。它有我所有的演出，它有我所有的人脉。所以我欠街头表演很多。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.<br>街头表演是 Josh 的主要收入来源，也是他的主要资金来源。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.<br>他说，街头表演让他获得了所有的演出和人脉。演出是音乐会。这是一个非正式的俚语。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?<br>Josh 说他欠街头表演很多。如果你欠某人或某事很多，那么你会因为那个人或事而获得成功或幸福。那么，你想听一些 Josh 的音乐吗，Neil？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Of course I would.<br>我当然会。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Phil<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.</p><p>Phil<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:</p><p>Adam Chandler<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.</p><p>Beth<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.</p><p>Phil<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.</p><p>Beth<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.</p><p>Phil<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.</p><p>Beth<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.</p><p>Phil<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.</p><p>Beth<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.</p><p>Phil<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.</p><p>Beth<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.</p><p>Phil<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!</p><p>Phil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?<br>不管你喜欢还是讨厌，毫无疑问，快餐很受欢迎。贝丝，你是快餐迷吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.<br>呃，不是真的，不是。我认为有时它可能非常方便，显然是因为它很快，但并非真的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.<br>好吧，无论你怎么看它们，像肯德基、达美乐，当然还有大麦当劳这样的快餐品牌，都取得了令人难以置信的成功。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在本节目中，我们将讨论快餐从 1950 年代美国开始的全球传播。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?<br>但首先，我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。英国大约有多少家快餐店？是：a） 4,000 个？b） 42,000 人？或者，c） 四百万？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.<br>我要选 b） 42,000。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:<br>好的，稍后我们会找出答案。在美国，自 1950 年代以来，汉堡包、炸薯条和奶昔等廉价易行的食物一直很受欢迎。请听亚当·钱德勒 （Adam Chandler） 讲述 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》（The Food Chain） 的故事，该书追溯了美国快餐的历史，该书的作者 Drive-Thru Dreams 讲述了这一切是如何开始的：</p><p>Adam Chandler(亚当·钱德勒)<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.<br>快餐故事的核心是一种非常 “任何人都可以做到 ”的感觉。许多公司创始人没有大学学位，在很多情况下没有高中学历，不是靠金钱赚钱的，他们通常只是准备将自己插入一个适合他们的系统的人。它确实做到了。在那个时代，机会变得非常、非常容易，因为这是美国经验的新部分。所以，在很小的方面，美国梦在很大程度上变成了美国梦。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.<br>快餐的兴起反映了二战后美国经济实力的崛起。当 Adam 说这是故事的核心时，他的意思是这是故事中最重要的部分。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.<br>在 1950 年代，当我们今天所知道的著名品牌刚刚起步时，任何具有积极进取的态度的人都可以销售快餐。“我能行”的态度描述了一个有信心并决心解决问题并取得成果的人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.<br>这正是 Kentucky Fried Chicken 和 McDonald’s 等成功餐厅发生的事情。对许多人来说，这些快餐品牌象征着美国梦 —— 即在美国，任何人都可以通过努力工作和决心取得成功。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.<br>肯德基、麦当劳和其他公司的成功不仅限于美国。如今，您可以参观地球两侧的两家麦当劳，并吃完全相同的饭菜。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.<br>但并不是每个国家都张开怀抱欢迎 —— 冰岛这个小岛就是其中之一。安迪·索菲亚·方丹 （Andie Sophia Fontaine） 曾经在麦当劳工作，现在是《冰岛评论》的编辑。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain，当麦当劳开始在冰岛首都雷克雅未克销售汉堡时，它受到了冷遇。</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine(安迪·索菲亚·方丹)<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.<br>冰岛的汉堡文化由来已久。他们对汉堡包有自己的想法，他们将使用生菜、生黄瓜和一种炸酱 —— 称为 shalpuborgari，或商店汉堡，已经存在了很长时间。是的，所以麦当劳 —— 他们努力维持市场。棺材上的最后一枚钉子是 2008&#x2F;2009 年的全球金融危机。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.<br>冰岛已经有吃汉堡的悠久传统 —— 这一传统已经存在了很长时间。例如，shalpuborgari 或商店汉堡是美国汉堡包的变体。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.<br>麦当劳在冰岛并不像其他地方那样成功。而 2008 年的全球金融危机是棺材上的最后一枚钉子，这一事件导致了已经开始出错的事情的失败。直到今天，冰岛还没有麦当劳，不像英国，这让我想起了你的问题，菲尔。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.<br>是的。我问你英国有多少家快餐店。我问你是 4,000 人、42,000 人还是 400 万人。当然，答案是 42,000 个，所以你是对的，干得好！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从核心开始，意思是某事最重要的部分或原因。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.<br>如果你说某人有“我能行”的态度，你的意思是他们有信心采取行动、解决问题和应对新的挑战。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.<br>美国梦是相信如果努力工作，美国每个人都有机会获得成功和快乐。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.<br>这个形容词 long-based 的意思是已经存在了很长时间。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.<br>对某物的接受意味着一种变体，或一种新的呈现方式。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!<br>最后，谚语 the final nail in the coffin，指的是导致已经开始失败的事情最终结束的事件。我们的六分钟又一次结束了，但为什么不前往 BBC Learning English 网站，在那里您可以找到专门针对此计划的工作表和测验。期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><p><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" alt="幻灯片1.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" alt="幻灯片2.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" alt="幻灯片3.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" alt="幻灯片4.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" alt="幻灯片5.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" alt="幻灯片6.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" alt="幻灯片7.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" alt="幻灯片8.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" alt="幻灯片9.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" alt="幻灯片10.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" alt="幻灯片11.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" alt="幻灯片12.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" alt="幻灯片13.PNG"><br><img src="/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" alt="幻灯片14.PNG"></p><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="at-the-heart-of"><a href="#at-the-heart-of" class="headerlink" title="at the heart of"></a>at the heart of</h4><p>to be the most important part, or main cause, of something<br>核心<br>是某事最重要的部分或主要原因<br>The success of the project lies at the heart of our future plans.<br>项目的成功是未来计划的核心。</p><h4 id="can-do-attitude"><a href="#can-do-attitude" class="headerlink" title="can-do attitude"></a>can-do attitude</h4><p>showing determination and confidence to take action and achieve results<br>积极进取的态度<br>表现出决心和信心去采取行动并取得成果<br>Her can-do attitude impressed the interviewers.<br>她积极进取的态度给面试官留下了深刻印象。</p><h4 id="The-American-dream"><a href="#The-American-dream" class="headerlink" title="The American dream"></a>The American dream</h4><p>the idea that everyone in the United States of America has the chance to be successful and happy if they work hard<br>美国梦<br>在美国，只要努力工作，每个人都有机会获得成功和幸福的理念<br>He believed in the American dream, working tirelessly to achieve his goals.<br>他相信美国梦，为实现目标而不懈努力。</p><h4 id="long-standing"><a href="#long-standing" class="headerlink" title="long-standing"></a>long-standing</h4><p>having existed for a long time<br>长期存在的<br>存在了很长时间<br>There’s a long-standing dispute between the two countries.<br>两国之间存在长期争端。</p><h4 id="a-take-on-something"><a href="#a-take-on-something" class="headerlink" title="a take on (something)"></a>a take on (something)</h4><p>a variation of, or new way of presenting, something which already exists<br>对（某事物）的诠释；一种（新的）处理方法<br>对已存在事物的变体或新的呈现方式<br>His take on the classic novel was both innovative and insightful.<br>他对这部经典小说的诠释既有创新性又富于洞察力。</p><h4 id="the-final-nail-in-the-coffin"><a href="#the-final-nail-in-the-coffin" class="headerlink" title="the final nail in the coffin"></a>the final nail in the coffin</h4><p>(idiom) an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail<br>最后一击；致命的一击<br>（习语）导致已经开始失败的事物最终结束的事件<br>The loss of their biggest client was the final nail in the coffin for the company.<br>失去最大的客户是这家公司彻底倒闭的最后一击。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?</p><p>Beth<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.</p><p>Beth<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.</p><p>Beth<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.</p><p>Phil<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.</p><p>Beth<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.</p><p>Phil<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.</p><p>Rando Kuustik<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.</p><p>Beth<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.</p><p>Phil<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?</p><p>Beth<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.</p><p>Phil<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.</p><p>Beth<br>Rivals are competitors.</p><p>Phil<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz related to this programme, and we’ll see you again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?<br>所以，贝丝，我们谈论的是当今世界上最好的教育系统。你在英国上学。您如何看待英国的教育体系？你认为这可能是最好的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.<br>我认为它相当不错，我个人可能会改变它的一些事情，但我想说它相当不错，但可能不是世界上最好的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.<br>好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论 Pisa 排名。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.<br>该排名基于经合组织（OECD）每三年进行的一次测试。这些测试试图显示哪些国家在数学、科学和阅读教学方面最有效。但这真的可以衡量吗？嗯，这是前 BBC 教育记者肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 与 BBC 世界服务节目“全球故事”的对话。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.<br>当它们第一次被引入时，这是一个非常有争议的想法，因为人们说’你怎么可能比较大国……你怎么能把美国与卢森堡或中国的部分地区，或者其他什么地方进行比较呢？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.<br>肖恩说，这些测试是有争议的。如果某件事是有争议的，那么它就是人们可能会争论的事情 —— 它是有争议的。因此，起初，比萨测试是有争议的，因为不是每个人都认为比较非常不同的国家是公平的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?<br>Phil，我有一个关于他们的问题要问你。因此，在 2022 年，新加坡在阅读排名中名列前茅。但这些国家中哪些位居第二呢？是：a） 美国？b） 爱尔兰？或者，c） 英国？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.<br>我想可能是 b） 爱尔兰。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目结束时发现这是否正确。比萨排名的一个常见模式是，最成功的国家往往规模较小。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 在接受 BBC 国际频道节目“全球故事”采访时告诉我们，许多西欧大国在排名中的得分并不高。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.<br>他们被这些快速崛起的国家超越和超越 —— 你知道的，新加坡、爱沙尼亚、台湾，或者那些我们历史上不认为是经济竞争对手的地方，但我想 PISA 测试的论点是，如果你想拥有一种知识经济，一种基于技能的经济，这就是你衡量它的方式。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.<br>我们听说许多欧洲大国正在被小国超越。如果有人超过你，他们就会比你走得更快 —— 速度更高。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.<br>我们使用前缀 ‘out-‘ 来表示某人或某事更擅长做某事。我们还听说，小国“跑赢”大国 —— 它们的表现更好。新加坡、爱沙尼亚和台湾被描述为欧洲大国的经济竞争对手 —— 这意味着它们在经济上正在与这些国家竞争。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>我们还听说了知识经济。这是一个以服务行业为基础的经济，这些行业要求工人受过高等教育，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.<br>那么，是什么让各国在这些测试中表现得更好呢？让我们再次聆听 BBC 国际服务节目“全球故事”。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 告诉我们，那些优先考虑让每个人都达到一定水平的国家做得很好。我们还听取了爱沙尼亚学校校长 Rando Kuustik 的发言。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.<br>确保所有学生都能接受一定水平的教育达到一定标准的国家，无论他们的背景如何，都做得很好。</p><p>Rando Kuustik(兰多·库斯蒂克)<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.<br>如果你用不同的水平或能力来教他们，那么你就是在隔离他们，我们不想把世界上的任何人都隔离开来，为什么我们在学校里这样做呢？这是爱沙尼亚成功的主要原因之一。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.<br>Sean 说，最成功的系统将每个人都教育到特定的标准，无论他们的背景如何。如果一件事发生而不考虑其他事情，这意味着其他事情不重要，或者不是问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.<br>兰多·库斯蒂克 （Rando Kuustik） 说，爱沙尼亚的学校不想隔离学生。隔离的意思是分离和保持分离。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?<br>那么，我们刚刚听说了爱沙尼亚，但贝丝，您的问题呢？那些国家呢？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.<br>我问你，在 2022 年 Pisa 排名中，美国、爱尔兰和英国的阅读量排名第二。你说的是爱尔兰，这是正确的答案。干的好！好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的关于教育排名的词汇，从有争议的 - 争论的或有争议的开始。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.<br>如果你被某人超越，他们就会比你走得更快。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rivals are competitors.<br>竞争对手就是竞争对手。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>知识经济是一种基于需要受过高等教育的工人的行业，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.<br>如果某件事发生，而不考虑第二件事，那么第二件事对它的发生没有影响。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Most people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you?</p><p>Phil<br>I ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious!</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, OK. Good!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>But let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:</p><p>David Shirley<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.</p><p>Phil<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.</p><p>Phil<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.</p><p>Beth<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.</p><p>Beth<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.</p><p>Phil<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.</p><p>Beth<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find a worksheet and a quiz related to this programme, and we’ll see you again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English.

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:<br>但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain：</p><p>David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.<br>我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.<br>大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?<br>50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.<br>哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜：</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.<br>在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.<br>厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.<br>哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:<br>玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物：</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.<br>从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.<br>让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?<br>生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.<br>啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.<br>当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.<br>动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.<br>如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.<br>当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?</p><p>Beth<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.</p><p>Phil<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s around 80% water.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:</p><p>Professor John Speakman<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.</p><p>Phil<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.</p><p>Beth<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.</p><p>Phil<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.</p><p>Phil<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.</p><p>Beth<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.</p><p>Phil<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.</p><p>Phil<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.</p><p>Beth<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?<br>我是 Beth。如今，我经常看到人们随身携带水瓶以确保他们喝得足够。你每天喝多少水，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?<br>哦，我不知道。也许大约一升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?<br>还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.<br>我想大概是两升。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.<br>啊，嗯，很多人听说的数字是每天两升。当然，每个人都需要喝一些水 —— 人体的一半以上是由水组成的。但是，我们究竟需要多少水才能保持健康呢？这就是我们将在本节目中讨论的内容，以及一些有用的新词汇。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>说到词汇，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上下载该节目中的所有新单词和短语，以及帮助您学习它们的工作表练习，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?<br>太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s around 80% water.<br>我认为大约 80% 是水。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:<br>好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授：</p><p>Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.<br>所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.<br>Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.<br>是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.<br>然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.<br>实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.<br>但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.<br>而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.<br>Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.<br>因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.<br>如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.<br>这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.<br>一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.<br>脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition.
