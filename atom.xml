Good to see you all.<br>各位下午好。很高興見到大家。</p><p>Since Inauguration Day, President Trump has secured trillions of dollars in private and foreign investments.<br>自就職日以來，特朗普總統已經獲得了數萬億美元的私人和外國投資。</p><p>Every single day, more money is pouring into our country, which will create more jobs for hardworking Americans.<br>每一天，都有更多的資金涌入我們國家，這將爲辛勤工作的美國人創造更多就業機會。</p><p>Today, Schneider Electric pledged to invest more than $700 million in the United States to boost American energy infrastructure and AI.<br>今天，施耐德電氣承諾在美國投資超過7億美元，以推動美國的能源基礎設施和人工智能發展。</p><p>On Monday, Hyundai announced a $20 billion investment in the United States, including $5.8 billion for a new steel plant in Louisiana, which will create nearly 1,500 high-paying jobs.<br>週一，現代汽車宣佈在美國投資200億美元，其中包括58億美元用於在路易斯安那州新建一座鋼鐵廠，這將創造近1500個高薪工作崗位。</p><p>President Trump is truly turning America back into a manufacturing superpower.<br>特朗普總統正在真正地讓美國重新成爲製造業超級大國。</p><p>Yesterday, President Trump marked National Medal of Honor Day by meeting with 21 of our nation’s bravest heroes and incredible patriots who have been awarded the highest military honor.<br>昨天，特朗普總統通過會見21位被授予最高軍事榮譽的我們國家最勇敢的英雄和了不起的愛國者，來紀念國家榮譽勳章日。</p><p>Beautiful picture. The President also signed a historic executive order to protect the integrity of American elections.<br>很美的畫面。總統還簽署了一項歷史性的行政命令，以保護美國選舉的公正性。</p><p>By strengthening voter citizenship verification and banning foreign nationals from interfering in U.S. elections.<br>通過加強選民公民身份驗證和禁止外國公民干預美國選舉。</p><p>These are the common-sense solutions that only Democrats could oppose.<br>這些是隻有民主黨人纔會反對的常識性解決方案。</p><p>But voters deserve elections they can trust, and critical confidence is being restored thanks to President Trump’s leadership.<br>但選民應該得到他們可以信任的選舉，並且由於特朗普總統的領導，關鍵的信心正在恢復。</p><p>Later this afternoon in the East Room, President Trump will mark Women’s History Month by honoring the exceptional women around our country,<br>今天下午晚些時候在東廳，特朗普總統將通過表彰我們國家各地的傑出女性來紀念婦女歷史月，</p><p>including the highly talented women in his administration and his Cabinet.<br>包括他政府和內閣中才華橫溢的女性。</p><p>And on an additional scheduling update, the President will hold a press conference in the Oval Office today at 4 o’clock p.m. to announce tariffs on the auto industry.<br>另外還有一個日程更新，總統今天下午4點將在橢圓形辦公室舉行新聞發佈會，宣佈對汽車行業徵收關稅。</p><p>And I will leave that to him to make that announcement later. Unfortunately, all of this good is happening for our country.<br>我將把這個宣佈留給他稍後來做。不幸的是，所有這些好事都在爲我們國家發生。 (Note: The “Unfortunately” here seems misplaced or sarcastic in the original context, the translation reflects the literal word.)（注：原文這裏的“不幸的是”似乎用詞不當或帶有諷刺意味，翻譯反映了字面意思。）</p><p>This administration is working hard on behalf of the American public every day,<br>本屆政府每天都在爲美國公衆努力工作，</p><p>but the mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalized story from the failing Atlantic magazine that is falling apart by the hour.<br>但主流媒體繼續關注來自瀕臨倒閉的《大西洋月刊》的一篇聳人聽聞的報道，這篇報道正以每小時的速度瓦解。</p><p>Here are the facts.<br>以下是事實。</p><p>The National Security Advisor has taken responsibility for this matter, and the National Security Council immediately said,<br>國家安全顧問已對此事負責，國家安全委員會立即表示，</p><p>alongside the White House Counsel’s office, that they are looking into how a reporter’s number was inadvertently added to this messaging thread.<br>與白宮法律顧問辦公室一起，他們正在調查一名記者的號碼是如何被無意中添加到這個消息線程中的。</p><p>We have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread.<br>我們一直說，這個消息線程中沒有發送任何機密材料。</p><p>There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed.<br>沒有透露任何地點、來源或方法，當然也沒有討論任何戰爭計劃。</p><p>The Atlantic has even admitted this themselves.<br>《大西洋月刊》自己甚至承認了這一點。</p><p>Their release of these internal messages validates the truth, which we have been saying all along.<br>他們公佈這些內部信息驗證了真相，這也是我們一直所說的。</p><p>If this story proves anything, it proves that Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media.<br>如果這個故事證明了什麼，那就是證明了民主黨人及其在主流媒體中的宣傳者。</p><p>Know how to fabricate, orchestrate, and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well.<br>非常懂得如何捏造、策劃和散佈虛假信息運動。</p><p>And there’s arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg.<br>可以說，媒體中沒有人比傑弗裏·戈德伯格更喜歡製造和推廣騙局了。</p><p>Goldberg is an anti-Trump hater. He is a registered Democrat.<br>戈德伯格是一個反特朗普的憎恨者。他是一名註冊民主黨人。</p><p>Goldberg’s wife is also a registered Democrat and a big Democrat donor who used to work under who?<br>戈德伯格的妻子也是一名註冊民主黨人，並且是一位重要的民主黨捐助者，她曾經在誰手下工作？</p><p>Hillary Clinton. This is the same Jeffrey Goldberg who infamously lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the Iraq War.<br>希拉里·克林頓。就是這位傑弗裏·戈德伯格，曾臭名昭著地就大規模殺傷性武器撒謊，將我們拖入伊拉克戰爭。</p><p>Which cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers.<br>那場戰爭耗費了數萬億美元和數千名美國士兵的生命。</p><p>And how else has Goldberg discredited himself?<br>戈德伯格還通過哪些方式使自己聲名掃地？</p><p>By absurdly claiming that President Trump was Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign.<br>通過在2016年競選期間荒謬地聲稱特朗普總統是弗拉基米爾·普京。</p><p>By peddling the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax that tried to hijack President Trump’s first term.<br>通過兜售試圖劫持特朗普總統第一個任期的“通俄門、通俄門、通俄門”騙局。</p><p>By inventing the suckers and losers hoax to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election.<br>通過捏造“笨蛋和失敗者”的騙局來幫助喬·拜登贏得2020年大選。</p><p>By peddling a hoax about President Trump involving Gold Star families to help Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, which our campaign at the time vigorously denied.<br>通過兜售一個涉及金星家庭的關於特朗普總統的騙局來幫助卡瑪拉·哈里斯贏得2024年大選，我們當時的競選團隊對此予以強烈否認。</p><p>Jeffrey Goldberg didn’t care. There’s more, but we don’t have all day.<br>傑弗裏·戈德伯格不在乎。還有更多，但我們沒有一整天的時間。</p><p>And we can now add this signal hoax to this very long list.<br>現在我們可以把這個Signal騙局添加到這個很長的列表中了。</p><p>The real story here is the overwhelming success of President Trump’s decisive military action against Houthi terrorists.<br>這裏的真實故事是特朗普總統對胡塞恐怖分子採取果斷軍事行動取得的壓倒性成功。</p><p>On March 15th, President Trump ordered a series of military operations against the terrorist Houthis to defend US shipping assets in the Red Sea,<br>3月15日，特朗普總統下令對恐怖組織胡塞武裝採取一系列軍事行動，以保衛美國在紅海的航運資產，</p><p>restore freedom of navigation for international shipping, and defend the United States from enemy threats.<br>恢復國際航運的航行自由，並保衛美國免受敵人威脅。</p><p>United States forces successfully struck dozens of targets across Houthi controlled territory.<br>美國軍隊成功打擊了胡塞武裝控制區內的數十個目標。</p><p>And as a result of these actions, several Houthi leaders were killed, including the Houthi drone chief, his deputy, and several of their drone experts and other key leaders.<br>這些行動的結果是，幾名胡塞領導人被擊斃，包括胡塞組織的無人機負責人、他的副手以及他們的幾名無人機專家和其他關鍵領導人。</p><p>We also destroyed command and controlled facilities, weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapon storage locations.<br>我們還摧毀了指揮和控制設施、武器製造設施以及先進武器儲存地點。</p><p>And it’s important to remember why this powerful action took place in the first place.<br>重要的是要記住，爲什麼一開始就採取了這次強有力的行動。</p><p>Because of Joe Biden’s incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage for years, the Houthi terrorists grew emboldened.<br>因爲喬·拜登多年來在世界舞臺上的無能和可悲的軟弱，胡塞恐怖分子變得更加膽大妄爲。</p><p>Immediately after taking office in 2021, Joe Biden removed the Iran-backed Houthis from the foreign terrorist organization in specifically designated global terrorist list.<br>2021年一上任，喬·拜登就將伊朗支持的胡塞武裝從外國恐怖組織和特別指定的全球恐怖分子名單中移除。</p><p>Did anybody in this room ask the Biden administration at the time why they made such a stupid mistake?<br>當時在座的各位，有誰問過拜登政府，他們爲什麼犯下如此愚蠢的錯誤？</p><p>This reckless action undid the designation put in place by President Trump during his first term, and what followed was predictable and devastating.<br>這一魯莽的行動撤銷了特朗普總統在其第一任期內實施的認定，隨之而來的是可預見的、毀滅性的後果。</p><p>The Houthis targeted US military ships and aircraft, hit commercial ships, including US flagged vessels, threatened our personnel overseas and attacked our allies in the region.<br>胡塞武裝襲擊了美國的軍艦和飛機，襲擊了包括懸掛美國國旗船隻在內的商船，威脅了我們在海外的人員，並襲擊了我們在該地區的盟友。</p><p>This resulted in more than a year of US flagged commercial ships being prevented from safely sailing through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden.<br>這導致懸掛美國國旗的商船一年多無法安全通過蘇伊士運河、紅海和亞丁灣。</p><p>This had a massive negative impact on global trade of the economic security of the United States.<br>這對全球貿易和美國的經濟安全造成了巨大的負面影響。</p><p>Joe Biden was the commander in chief, and he sat on his hands while the United States of America was bullied and embarrassed by terrorists.<br>喬·拜登是總司令，但他卻袖手旁觀，任由美利堅合衆國被恐怖分子欺凌和羞辱。</p><p>President Trump and his team are putting a stop to these threats in restoring American strength around the world.<br>特朗普總統及其團隊正在制止這些威脅，恢復美國在世界各地的實力。</p><p>The Trump “peace through strength” approach means no terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the waterways of the world.<br>特朗普的“以實力求和平”方針意味着，沒有任何恐怖勢力能夠阻止美國的商業和海軍船隻在世界水道上自由航行。</p><p>But unfortunately, this is not what the Democrats and the media want to talk about.<br>但不幸的是，這並不是民主黨和媒體想要談論的。</p><p>They are focused on a coordinated campaign to try and sow chaos in this White House.<br>他們正專注於一場協調一致的運動，試圖在這個白宮製造混亂。</p><p>And this has been the most successful first two months of any administration ever, which is exactly why they are doing this.<br>而這恰恰是有史以來任何一屆政府最成功的頭兩個月，這也正是他們這樣做的原因。</p><p>We are not going to bend in the face of this insincere outrage. And here is just one example of how bad faith the Democrats’ criticisms are.<br>我們不會在這種虛僞的憤怒面前屈服。這裏有一個例子說明民主黨人的批評是多麼缺乏誠信。</p><p>Democrat Senator Mark Warner is hysterical over the use of Signal, which is an approved decrypted app, and the killing of Houthi terrorists.<br>民主黨參議員馬克·華納對使用Signal（一款經批准的解密應用程序）以及擊斃胡塞恐怖分子感到歇斯底里。</p><p>But Senator Warner himself used Signal to work with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to connect the disgraced Steele dossier author who started the Russia hoax,<br>但華納參議員本人卻使用Signal與一位俄羅斯寡頭的說客合作，聯繫上了聲名狼藉的斯蒂爾檔案的作者，正是他開始了通俄騙局，</p><p>which Jeffrey Goldberg later reported on. How ironic.<br>而傑弗裏·戈德伯格後來對此進行了報道。多麼諷刺。</p><p>We’re not going to lose focus of the bottom line, which is that Joe Biden’s weakness enabled an emboldened Houthi terrorists.<br>我們不會忽視底線，那就是喬·拜登的軟弱助長了膽大妄爲的胡塞恐怖分子。</p><p>And President Trump’s strength in resolve eliminated those terrorists. Here in our new media seat today, we have Lindsay Keith.<br>而特朗普總統的決心和力量消滅了那些恐怖分子。今天在我們新的媒體席位上，我們有林賽·基思。</p><p>She is the managing editor for Merit TV and serves as their White House correspondent.<br>她是 Merit TV 的執行主編，並擔任他們的白宮記者。</p><p>Merit TV launched one year ago and creates and distributes content across diverse platforms.<br>Merit TV 於一年前推出，在各種平臺上創作和分發內容。</p><p>We’re glad to have you with us, Lindsay. Please kick us off. Thank you, Caroline. I appreciate it and this opportunity for Merit TV.<br>我們很高興你能和我們在一起，林賽。請你開始吧。謝謝你，卡羅琳。我很感激這次機會以及 Merit TV 的這次機會。</p><p>Two questions, if I may. One on Signal, one on the economy. Sure.<br>如果可以的話，我有兩個問題。一個關於Signal，一個關於經濟。當然。</p><p>On Signal, how comfortable is the President with what was shared so far now that the chain has been released?<br>關於Signal，既然信息鏈已經被公佈，總統對目前爲止分享的內容感覺如何？</p><p>The President’s view on all of this remains the same today as it did yesterday.<br>總統對此事的看法今天和昨天一樣。</p><p>And I think it speaks volumes about the leadership of this President, that he went directly to all of you, members of the press corps.<br>我認爲這充分說明了這位總統的領導力，他直接走向了你們各位，記者團的成員們。</p><p>He was asked, “Do you want someone else to go out and do a briefing?”<br>有人問他：“你想讓別人出去做簡報嗎？”</p><p>And he said, “No. I will tackle this story. I will discuss it. The people need to hear from me about this situation. “<br>他說：“不。我將處理這個故事。我將討論它。人民需要聽到我關於這個情況的說明。”</p><p>And so his thoughts on this remain the same today. He has placed great trust in his national security team.<br>因此，他對此事的想法今天仍然保持不變。他對他的國家安全團隊給予了極大的信任。</p><p>And as for the usage of Signal, as the President said yesterday, as the CIA director has testified under oath, this is an approved app.<br>至於Signal的使用，正如總統昨天所說，正如中央情報局局長在宣誓下作證所說，這是一款經過批准的應用程序。</p><p>It’s an encrypted app. The Department of Defense, the Department of State, the CIA has it loaded onto government phones.<br>這是一款加密應用程序。國防部、國務院、中央情報局都已將其安裝在政府手機上。</p><p>Because it is the most secure and efficient way to communicate.<br>因爲這是最安全、最高效的溝通方式。</p><p>As for, again, the original situation in this messaging thread, the National Security Council,<br>至於，再次強調，這個消息線程中的最初情況，國家安全委員會，</p><p>the White House Counsel’s Office continues to look in to how this mistake, which the National Security Advisor has owned, occurred.<br>白宮法律顧問辦公室正在繼續調查這個錯誤是如何發生的，國家安全顧問已經承認了這一錯誤。</p><p>And the President has ensured they are doing that. On the economy, consumer confidence hit a four-year low this month.<br>總統已確保他們正在這樣做。關於經濟，本月消費者信心指數跌至四年來的最低點。</p><p>Can you help explain to the American people how tariffs will help them in the long run? Yeah, absolutely.<br>你能向美國人民解釋一下關稅從長遠來看將如何幫助他們嗎？是的，當然可以。</p><p>And I’m grateful for the question. The American public will hear later this afternoon from the President directly on the topic of tariffs.<br>我很感謝這個問題。今天下午晚些時候，美國公衆將直接從總統那裏聽到關於關稅問題的講話。</p><p>And as you all know, April 2nd, President Trump has proudly dubbed it Liberation Day for our country.<br>正如大家所知，4月2日，特朗普總統自豪地將其稱爲我們國家的解放日。</p><p>What he means by that is it will be a day where the United States of America will no longer be ripped off by nations around this world.<br>他的意思是，這一天，美利堅合衆國將不再被世界各國敲詐勒索。</p><p>It will be a day where Americans finally see free and fair trade practices restored.<br>這一天，美國人將最終看到自由公平的貿易慣例得以恢復。</p><p>We are no longer going to allow our allies, our competitors, and our adversaries to take advantage of American workers.<br>我們不會再允許我們的盟友、競爭對手和對手佔美國工人的便宜。</p><p>And if you think about your hometown in the state that you grew up, Main Street looks a lot different today than it did many years ago.<br>如果你想想你長大的那個州的家鄉，今天的主街看起來和多年前大不相同了。</p><p>And President Trump wants to restore America as a manufacturing superpower around the globe.<br>特朗普總統希望將美國恢復爲全球製造業超級大國。</p><p>He wants products to be made right here in our great country with great, hardworking American hands.<br>他希望產品就在我們偉大的國家，由偉大的、勤勞的美國人之手製造出來。</p><p>That will ultimately result in higher wages and more money in the pockets of the American people.<br>這最終將導致更高的工資和美國人民口袋裏更多的錢。</p><p>And he’s also, in addition to tariffs, also determined to pass tax cuts later this year, as he did successfully in his first term,<br>而且，除了關稅之外，他還決心在今年晚些時候通過減稅法案，就像他在第一個任期內成功做到的那樣，</p><p>to put even more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans.<br>將更多的錢放回辛勤工作的美國人的口袋裏。</p><p>Peter. Caroline, if I can ask you very quickly about the information we’ve seen, just to set the predicate to all this,<br>彼得。卡羅琳，如果我可以非常快地問你關於我們所看到的信息，只是爲了給這一切設定前提，</p><p>has the President been briefed and physically seen the, he’s seen all the details of the chat that is printed by the Atlantic?<br>總統是否聽取了簡報並親眼看到了，他是否看到了《大西洋月刊》刊登的聊天記錄的所有細節？</p><p>I just spoke to the President about it, yes. Then let me ask you if I can very quickly.<br>我剛和總統談過此事，是的。那麼請允許我很快地問一下。</p><p>In the chat, Pete Hex at the Defense Secretary details F-18s, Tomahawks, some of the weapons that were used.<br>在聊天記錄中，國防部長的皮特·赫克斯詳細描述了F-18、戰斧導彈以及一些使用的武器。 (Note: Assuming “Pete Hex” is a typo for Pete Hegseth, the Defense Secretary mentioned later)（注：假設“Pete Hex”是後面提到的國防部長 Pete Hegseth 的筆誤）</p><p>He details the timing involved for this, all of which occurred 31 minutes before, as he says F-18s would launch.<br>他詳細說明了相關的時間安排，所有這些都發生在他所說的F-18起飛前31分鐘。</p><p>The DOD manual details classified information as significant military plans, saying that is secret, that that’s classified.<br>國防部手冊將重大軍事計劃詳細列爲機密信息，稱其爲祕密，即機密。</p><p>So what about there are no methods, there are no sources, but that’s not what determines what’s classified.<br>那麼，沒有方法，沒有來源，但這並不是決定什麼內容是機密的標準。</p><p>So what is it about what Pete Hex at the road that makes you say this is not classified?<br>那麼，皮特·赫克斯所說的話中到底有什麼讓您說這不是機密呢？ (Note: “at the road” seems like a transcription error, likely meant “wrote”)<br>（注：“at the road”似乎是轉錄錯誤，可能意爲“wrote”）</p><p>Well, it’s not just me saying that, Peter. It’s the Secretary of Defense himself who is saying this as well.<br>嗯，不只是我這麼說，彼得。國防部長本人也是這麼說的。</p><p>And he put out a very strong statement earlier today, listing all of the things that were not included in that message that he sent to the group.<br>他今天早些時候發表了一份非常強硬的聲明，列出了他發送給小組的那條消息中未包含的所有內容。</p><p>And again, this message, there was no classified information transmitted, there were no war plans discussed.<br>再次強調，這條信息沒有傳輸任何機密信息，也沒有討論任何戰爭計劃。</p><p>Why did the Atlantic downgrade their allegation about war plans to attack plans?<br>爲什麼《大西洋月刊》將其關於戰爭計劃的指控降級爲攻擊計劃？</p><p>They’re now playing word games because they know this was sensationalist spin from a reporter who is well known for doing this.<br>他們現在在玩文字遊戲，因爲他們知道這是一個以搞這種事聞名的記者製造的聳人聽聞的歪曲報道。</p><p>We have said all along no war plans were discussed, no classified material was sent.<br>我們一直說沒有討論戰爭計劃，沒有發送機密材料。</p><p>You have the Secretary of Defense saying that.<br>國防部長是這麼說的。</p><p>You have the director of the CIA, the director of national intelligence, the FBI director all testifying to that under oath, and they should be trusted with that.<br>你有中央情報局局長、國家情報總監、聯邦調查局局長都在宣誓下爲此作證，他們應該在這方面被信任。</p><p>To be clear, Americans can make the decision for themselves, but whether is the.<br>需要明確的是，美國人可以自己做決定，但是否是… (Sentence seems incomplete in the original)<br>（原句似乎不完整）</p><p>Sure. You said it’s not war plans. Would you characterize these as military plans, military operation plans?<br>當然。您說這不是戰爭計劃。您會將其描述爲軍事計劃、軍事行動計劃嗎？</p><p>I would characterize this messaging thread as a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion, surely, amongst high-level cabinet officials and senior staff.<br>我會將這個消息線程描述爲一次政策討論，當然是一次敏感的政策討論，是在高級內閣官員和高級職員之間進行的。</p><p>And I’m so glad, Peter, that you said the American public can decide for themselves, because I think the American public should decide for themselves based on the outcome of this operation.<br>我很高興，彼得，你說了美國公衆可以自己決定，因爲我認爲美國公衆應該根據這次行動的結果自己決定。</p><p>And what happened in this operation, terrorists that were allowed to run wild by the Biden administration were killed because of the direction and the determination of this president and his team.<br>在這次行動中發生的事情是，那些被拜登政府允許肆意妄爲的恐怖分子，因爲這位總統及其團隊的指揮和決心而被消滅了。</p><p>And this message also shows this messaging thread also proved that President Trump has an incredibly dynamic team who is working incredibly hard,<br>這條信息也表明，這個消息線程也證明了，特朗普總統擁有一支極其充滿活力的團隊，他們正在極其努力地工作，</p><p>flying all over the world to secure world peace and to fix up the foreign policy crises that the previous administration left for this team to inherit.<br>飛往世界各地以確保世界和平，並收拾上一屆政府留給這個團隊繼承的外交政策危機。</p><p>So, to be clear, we all in this room and around the country would agree that we’re glad no American service members were harmed and we’re glad that the mission was a success.<br>所以，需要明確的是，我們這個房間裏和全國各地的人都會同意，我們很高興沒有美國軍人受傷，我們很高興任務取得了成功。</p><p>We’ll stipulate that. But the president said that Pete Hegsett said none of this was classified.<br>我們承認這一點。但是總統說皮特·赫格賽斯說過這些都不是機密。</p><p>So, given the president has seen it now and given the president understands that significant military plans are deemed classified as secret,<br>那麼，鑑於總統現在已經看到了，並且鑑於總統理解重大的軍事計劃被視爲機密，</p><p>how does the president view none of this, which details times and weapons and more, as being not classified?<br>總統是如何看待這些詳細說明了時間、武器等信息的內容爲非機密的？</p><p>I’ve already been asked and answered this question.<br>我已經問過並回答了這個問題。</p><p>The president’s thoughts on this remain the same today as they were yesterday, as well as the Secretary of Defense.<br>總統對此事的想法今天和昨天一樣，國防部長也一樣。</p><p>This question has been asked and answered. There was no classified material discussed.<br>這個問題已經被問過並且回答過了。沒有討論機密材料。</p><p>Jackie. On what basis I was asked? Go ahead, Jackie. Thank you, Caroline.<br>傑基。基於什麼我被問到了？請說，傑基。謝謝你，卡羅琳。</p><p>So, why aren’t launch times on a mission strike classified?<br>那麼，爲什麼任務打擊的發射時間不屬於機密？</p><p>Again, I would defer you to the Secretary of Defense’s statement he put out this morning.<br>再次，我建議您參考國防部長今天早上發佈的聲明。</p><p>There were various reasons he listed things that were not included in that messaging thread that were not classified.<br>他列舉了各種原因，說明了該消息線程中未包含的、非機密的內容。</p><p>And again, going back to the American public, do you trust the Secretary of Defense, who was nominated for this role,<br>再次回到美國公衆，您是信任這位被提名擔任此職位、</p><p>voted by the United States Senate into this role, who has served in combat, honorably served our nation in uniform?<br>由美國參議院投票選入此職位、曾在戰鬥中服役、光榮地穿着軍裝爲我們國家服務過的國防部長？</p><p>Or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg, who is a registered Democrat and an anti-Trump sensationalist reporter?<br>還是信任傑弗裏·戈德伯格，一位註冊民主黨人和反特朗普的聳人聽聞的記者？</p><p>This president and this national security team are putting our national security and the American people first.<br>這位總統和這個國家安全團隊將我們的國家安全和美國人民放在首位。</p><p>We are restoring American strength around the world, and the results of this operation speak for themselves.<br>我們正在恢復美國在世界各地的實力，這次行動的結果不言自明。</p><p>Putting aside Jeffrey Goldberg, though, just for American service members who are gonna have to carry out these missions in the future,<br>不過，拋開傑弗裏·戈德伯格不談，僅就未來將不得不執行這些任務的美國軍人而言，</p><p>I guess the message that’s coming from the response to all this that we’re hearing is that, nothing sensitive happened.<br>我猜我們聽到的對這一切的迴應所傳達的信息是，沒有發生任何敏感的事情。</p><p>And I guess the logical conclusion of that is that if these messages had gone out publicly prior to the launch, that that wouldn’t have been a risk to service members.<br>我猜其邏輯結論是，如果這些信息在發射前公開發布，那也不會對軍人構成風險。</p><p>I don’t know that they’re comfortable with that. So, can you explain, you know, had these messages been published, would the plans have moved forward?<br>我不知道他們是否對此感到安心。所以，你能解釋一下，你知道，如果這些信息被公佈了，計劃還會繼續推進嗎？</p><p>Would the launch have still taken off? What I can tell you is that the president, as the commander-in-chief of our United States Armed Forces,<br>發射還會進行嗎？我能告訴你的是，總統，作爲我們美國武裝部隊的總司令，</p><p>and Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is an incredible man and a war fighter himself,<br>以及皮特·赫格賽斯部長，他本人是一位了不起的人，也是一位戰士，</p><p>take the lives of our American service members with the utmost responsibility, and they would never do anything intentionally to put their lives at risk.<br>以最大的責任感對待我們美國軍人的生命，他們絕不會故意做任何危及他們生命的事情。</p><p>And again, they are working hard on that every single day, and we are protecting our service members while also restoring peace throughout this globe.<br>再次強調，他們每天都在爲此努力工作，我們在保護我們的軍人，同時也在恢復全球的和平。</p><p>It’s something the previous administration has not done. And I would just add one more point.<br>這是上一屆政府沒有做到的事情。我只想再補充一點。</p><p>We are not going to be lectured about national security and American troops by Democrats in the mainstream media who turned the other cheek when the Biden administration,<br>我們不會接受主流媒體中的民主黨人就國家安全和美國軍隊問題對我們說教，當拜登政府因爲無能</p><p>because of their incompetence, left 13 service members dead in Afghanistan,<br>導致13名軍人在阿富汗喪生時，他們卻視而不見，</p><p>and not a single person in the previous administration was held accountable for that botched withdrawal.<br>而上一屆政府中沒有一個人爲那次拙劣的撤軍負責。</p><p>Joe Biden said, “In fact, it was a great operation.”<br>喬·拜登說：“事實上，那是一次偉大的行動。”</p><p>That is despicable. It’s unacceptable to this president and this secretary of defense.<br>那是卑鄙的。這對於這位總統和這位國防部長來說是不可接受的。</p><p>The national security advisor has taken responsibility for this inadvertent number being added to the messaging thread,<br>國家安全顧問已爲這個無意中添加到消息線程的號碼負責，</p><p>but above all, we take the lives of our troops, safety, security, prosperity around the globe with the utmost seriousness.<br>但最重要的是，我們以最嚴肅的態度對待我們軍隊的生命、全球的安全、保障和繁榮。</p><p>Karen, do you believe that he would release that to embarrass the administration ahead of the worldwide threats?<br>凱倫，你相信他會爲了在面臨全球威脅之前讓政府難堪而公佈這些嗎？</p><p>Jennifer, go ahead. Given what you’ve said about the president’s trust in his national security team,<br>詹妮弗，請說。鑑於您所說的總統對他的國家安全團隊的信任，</p><p>can you say definitively that no one will lose their jobs, no one will lose their job at all because of this signal situation?<br>您能明確地說，沒有人會因爲這次Signal事件而丟掉工作，絕對沒有人會丟掉工作嗎？</p><p>What I can say definitively is what I just spoke to the president about, and he continues to have confidence in his national security team.<br>我能明確說的是我剛剛和總統談過的內容，他繼續對他的國家安全團隊充滿信心。</p><p>Karen, one more. Can I ask one more, Karen?<br>凱倫，還有一個。我能再問一個嗎，凱倫？</p><p>On the targets in Yemen on March 15th, can you say were 100% of the targets that were planned for March 15th, were they all destroyed?<br>關於3月15日在也門的目標，您能說計劃於3月15日打擊的目標是否100%都被摧毀了嗎？</p><p>Because that would be an indication if some of them were moved.<br>因爲如果其中一些目標被移動了，這將是一個跡象。</p><p>But they were not all hit that maybe perhaps some of the enemies were able to get some of the information in that signal.<br>但並非所有目標都被擊中，也許可能一些敵人能夠通過那個Signal獲取一些信息。 (Slightly awkward phrasing in original, kept meaning)<br>（原文措辭略顯笨拙，保留了意思）</p><p>What I can say about the operation is what the Department of Defense has put out there.<br>關於這次行動，我能說的是國防部已經公佈的內容。</p><p>I would refer to them for any further operational details, but there have been more than 100 strikes conducted against Houthi targets,<br>我建議您向他們諮詢任何進一步的行動細節，但已經對胡塞目標進行了100多次打擊，</p><p>and they have hit key Houthi leaders, air defense systems, commanding control nodes, headquarters, weapons manufacturing, and storage facilities,<br>並且打擊了關鍵的胡塞領導人、防空系統、指揮控制節點、總部、武器製造和儲存設施，</p><p>and these operations will continue until the freedom of navigation in our seas is restored and US shipping can safely transmit without the fear of attack.<br>這些行動將繼續進行，直到我們海域的航行自由得到恢復，美國船隻能夠安全通行而不用擔心受到攻擊。</p><p>And again, we believe that this has been a very successful operation thus far, and it will continue until this administration feels it no longer has to,<br>再次強調，我們相信到目前爲止這是一次非常成功的行動，並且將繼續下去，直到本屆政府認爲不再需要爲止，</p><p>and these terrorists have been taking out, which again is something previous administration should have done, but they didn’t, and now we’ve inherited this crisis.<br>並且這些恐怖分子已經被清除，這又是上一屆政府本應做但沒有做的事情，現在我們繼承了這個危機。</p><p>Steve. Thank you, Caroline. I’d like to clarify something about the investigation and also ask about some conservative commentary.<br>史蒂夫。謝謝你，卡羅琳。我想澄清一下關於調查的事情，並問一些關於保守派評論的問題。</p><p>On the investigation, Mike Waltz said last night that he had spoken to Elon Musk about figuring out how Jeffrey Goldberg’s number got in his phone.<br>關於調查，邁克·沃爾茲昨晚說，他已經和埃隆·馬斯克談過，要弄清楚傑弗裏·戈德伯格的號碼是怎麼進入他手機的。</p><p>You mentioned the NSC and the White House Counsel’s Office investigating.<br>你提到了國家安全委員會和白宮法律顧問辦公室正在調查。</p><p>Can you just clarify who is investigating, who’s leading that, and also Dave Portnoy, who endorsed President Trump, said today that he thinks that Mike Waltz should leave.<br>你能否澄清一下是誰在調查，誰在領導調查，另外，支持特朗普總統的戴夫·波特諾伊今天說，他認爲邁克·沃爾茲應該離開。</p><p>Could you respond to that? Sure. Great respect for Dave Portnoy, but I just answered that previous question from Jennifer.<br>你能迴應一下嗎？當然。非常尊重戴夫·波特諾伊，但我剛剛回答了詹妮弗之前的那個問題。</p><p>As for your original question about who’s leading, looking into the messaging thread, the National Security Council, the White House Counsel’s Office.<br>至於你最初關於誰在領導調查消息線程的問題，是國家安全委員會、白宮法律顧問辦公室。</p><p>And also, yes, Elon Musk’s team. Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat.<br>還有，是的，埃隆·馬斯克的團隊。埃隆·馬斯克已經提出讓他的技術專家參與進來，以查明這個號碼是如何被無意中添加到聊天中的。</p><p>Again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again.<br>再次強調，是爲了承擔責任並確保這種情況永遠不會再次發生。</p><p>Carol Lynn. Caitlin. I have two questions, one on a follow-up on something you just said.<br>卡羅爾·林恩。凱特琳。我有兩個問題，一個是關於你剛纔說的話的後續問題。</p><p>But since we have these messages released, and you said that the President has now personally reviewed them.<br>但是既然這些信息已經公佈了，而且您說總統現在已經親自審閱了它們。</p><p>At the chat at one point, Pete Hexeth wrote, “1415, strike drones on target.” And in all caps, he said, “This is when the first bombs will definitely drop.”<br>在聊天記錄的某個時刻，皮特·赫格賽斯寫道：“1415，打擊無人機命中目標。”他用全大寫字母說：“這是第一批炸彈肯定會投下的時候。”</p><p>Does the President feel that he was misled by his national security advisors.<br>總統是否覺得他被他的國家安全顧問誤導了。</p><p>Whoever it was that told him there was no classified information in there now that he’s seen these messages?<br>無論當初是誰告訴他裏面沒有機密信息，既然他現在已經看到了這些信息？</p><p>I’ve now been asked and answered this question three times by the both of you, and I’ve given you my answer.<br>你們倆現在已經問了我三次這個問題了，我也給出了我的答案。</p><p>The President feels the same today as he did yesterday. Sorry, am I follow-up on what you were just saying?<br>總統今天的感受和昨天一樣。抱歉，我是不是要跟進你剛纔說的話？</p><p>Go ahead, Phillip. Caitlin, I’m not taking your follow-up. I have a follow-up on something you just said, though, Caroline.<br>請說，菲利普。凱特琳，我不接受你的後續提問。不過，卡羅琳，我有一個關於你剛纔說的話的後續問題。</p><p>Caitlin, I’m not taking your follow-up. Phillip, go ahead. I have called on you.<br>凱特琳，我不接受你的後續提問。菲利普，請說。我已經點到你了。</p><p>The Vice President seemed to express some frustration that Europe wasn’t doing more police waterways in their backyard,<br>副總統似乎表達了一些不滿，認爲歐洲沒有在其後院的水道上做更多的警務工作，</p><p>noting in that signal thread that 40% of European trade goes through the Suez Canal.<br>在那個Signal線程中指出，40%的歐洲貿易通過蘇伊士運河。</p><p>Does the President share that opinion and frustration?<br>總統是否持有同樣的觀點和不滿？</p><p>And then going forward, should the Europeans be responsible for policing that waterway?<br>那麼未來，歐洲人是否應該負責管理那條水道？</p><p>Well, the President was asked this question yesterday by the pool in the Cabinet Room, and he answered this question.<br>嗯，總統昨天在內閣會議室被記者團問到了這個問題，他回答了這個問題。</p><p>He said yes. He believes that Europe has been, as the Vice President put it.<br>他說是的。他認爲歐洲一直以來，正如副總統所說的那樣。</p><p>Free-loading on the backs of American taxpayers and off the backs of the United States of America,<br>一直在佔美國納稅人和美利堅合衆國的便宜（搭便車），</p><p>and he wants to ensure that Europe pays their fair share.<br>他希望確保歐洲支付他們公平的份額。</p><p>He’s always been very honest and upfront about that, and I think the Vice President shares those concerns with him as well.<br>他對此一直非常誠實和坦率，我認爲副總統也與他有同樣的擔憂。</p><p>Sure. Enlisted soldiers, sailors, and Marines would face consequences if they shared this type of information inadvertently with a reporter.<br>當然。如果士兵、水手和海軍陸戰隊員無意中與記者分享了這類信息，他們將面臨後果。</p><p>Can you tell us more why the President is so willing to give Mike Waltz a mulligan here?<br>您能告訴我們更多關於爲什麼總統如此願意在這裏給邁克·沃爾茲一次“重打”（原諒）的機會嗎？</p><p>Again, I have now been asked and answered this same question using different language multiple times.<br>再次強調，我已經用不同的措辭多次被問及並回答了同一個問題。</p><p>If anybody has another question, there’s a lot of different things going on in the world.<br>如果有人有其他問題，世界上正在發生很多不同的事情。</p><p>We have tariffs possibly being implemented later today. The President is going to talk about that at 4 o’clock this afternoon.<br>今天晚些時候可能會實施關稅。總統今天下午4點會談到這個問題。</p><p>Sure, go ahead. Okay, thank you for taking my question.<br>當然，請說。好的，謝謝您接受我的提問。</p><p>I wanted to first and foremost thank the administration for the Election Integrity Executive Order.<br>我首先要感謝本屆政府發佈的選舉誠信行政命令。</p><p>Because so many journalists for four years were banned from talking about this very subject,<br>因爲四年來，許多記者被禁止談論這個話題，</p><p>so thank you to the administration for that.<br>所以爲此感謝本屆政府。</p><p>My question is, yesterday, President Trump went on and the order said that there was more to come when it comes to election integrity.<br>我的問題是，昨天，特朗普總統繼續說，並且該命令表示，在選舉誠信方面還會有更多措施。</p><p>Would that include same-day voting and hand-counted paper ballots?<br>那會包括當日投票和手計紙質選票嗎？</p><p>And why are Democrats so against election integrity measures like, obviously, a proof of citizenship when it comes to voting in a United States election?<br>爲什麼民主黨人如此反對選舉誠信措施，比如，很明顯，在美國大選中投票時需要提供公民身份證明？</p><p>Well, it’s a very good question. You’ll have to ask the Democrats why they’re against so many common-sense things, not just mandating voter ID.<br>嗯，這是個很好的問題。你得問問民主黨人爲什麼他們反對這麼多常識性的事情，不僅僅是強制要求選民身份證明。</p><p>Why are they against men and women’s sports?<br>爲什麼他們反對男子和女子體育運動？</p><p>Why are they against deporting foreign terrorists from American soil who have been designated a foreign terrorist organization?<br>爲什麼他們反對將已被指定爲外國恐怖組織的外國恐怖分子驅逐出美國領土？</p><p>I’m referring to Trendy Aragwa.<br>我指的是 Trendy Aragwa。（注：此名字可能爲音譯或轉錄錯誤，未找到明確指代對象）</p><p>As for the Election Integrity Executive Order that the President signed yesterday, this is in an effort to restore trust in American elections.<br>至於總統昨天簽署的選舉誠信行政命令，這是爲了努力恢復對美國選舉的信任。</p><p>There were more than 10 steps taken, 10 executive actions taken throughout this one order.<br>這一個命令中採取了超過10個步驟，10項行政行動。</p><p>It directs the Department or the Attorney General, rather, in Homeland Security to prevent non-citizens from any involvement in administering elections.<br>它指示司法部長，更確切地說，在國土安全部內，阻止非公民參與任何管理選舉的活動。</p><p>There’s also another host of actions. We can provide the fact sheet for you, but it’s a very strong Election Integrity Executive Order.<br>還有一系列其他行動。我們可以爲您提供情況說明書，但這是一個非常強有力的選舉誠信行政命令。</p><p>And the President would also like to see Congress do something about this very important issue. And about Judge Bowie. Sure. Go ahead.<br>總統也希望看到國會就這個非常重要的問題採取行動。還有關於鮑伊法官的事。當然。請說。</p><p>Caroline, the Republicans and Democrats alike have been expressing some concern about the frequency of which senior Trump officials have been using the Signal app.<br>卡羅琳，共和黨人和民主黨人都對特朗普高級官員使用Signal應用的頻率表示了一些擔憂。</p><p>Has there been discussion, or will there be a review, about how often they use Signal?<br>是否有過討論，或者是否會審查他們使用Signal的頻率？</p><p>And if you could explain to us how they might be considering other applications to get away from something like this happening again.<br>您能否向我們解釋一下，他們可能正在考慮使用哪些其他應用程序，以避免類似情況再次發生。</p><p>Sure. Well, again, first of all, Signal has been an approved app for government use. It’s an encrypted app.<br>當然。嗯，再次強調，首先，Signal一直是政府批准使用的應用程序。它是一款加密應用。</p><p>And as I said, it’s the most safe and efficient way of communicating, especially when people can’t be in a skiff or inside a room physically together.<br>正如我所說，這是最安全、最高效的溝通方式，特別是當人們不能身處安全通訊室（skiff）或物理上共處一室時。</p><p>I think, as the President said yesterday, he wishes that everybody could be in the room, and it’s our goal to ensure that everybody can be.<br>我認爲，正如總統昨天所說，他希望每個人都能在房間裏，我們的目標是確保每個人都能在。</p><p>But again, no classified information was discussed in this chat.<br>但再次強調，這次聊天中沒有討論任何機密信息。</p><p>And any time classified information is discussed amongst high-level officials across this administration,<br>在本屆政府中，任何時候高級官員之間討論機密信息時，</p><p>secure lines of communication are used, including, by the way, our special envoy, Steve Witkoff,<br>都會使用安全的通信線路，順便說一句，包括我們的特使史蒂夫·威特科夫，</p><p>who I understand the Wall Street Journal erroneously reported that he was on this Signal chat on a personal device while in Moscow.<br>據我瞭解，《華爾街日報》錯誤地報道說，他在莫斯科時使用個人設備參與了這個Signal聊天。</p><p>That is absolutely false. Steve Witkoff did not have his personal device, nor did he have his government device with him.<br>那絕對是假的。史蒂夫·威特科夫既沒有攜帶他的個人設備，也沒有攜帶他的政府設備。</p><p>He was given a classified, protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.<br>美國政府給了他一個機密的、受保護的服務器，他在俄羅斯期間對自己的通訊非常謹慎。</p><p>So rest assured to the American public, this administration is taking every precaution when it comes to protecting our national security.<br>所以請美國公衆放心，本屆政府在保護我們國家安全方面正在採取一切預防措施。</p><p>And that’s why the American people re-elected this President, because they know that our national security is in good hands with the President of the United States.<br>這就是爲什麼美國人民再次選舉這位總統，因爲他們知道我們的國家安全掌握在美利堅合衆國總統手中是安全的。</p><p>Speaking of the Vice President, I understand he’s going to be speaking any moment now.<br>說到副總統，我瞭解到他馬上就要講話了。</p><p>I would hate to counter-program the Vice President of the United States. You’ll also hear from the President at 3 o’clock.<br>我可不想和美利堅合衆國副總統的節目衝突。你們也會在3點鐘聽到總統的講話。</p><p>He will be honoring women’s history at the Women’s History Month celebration.<br>他將在婦女歷史月慶祝活動上表彰婦女歷史。</p><p>We have a lot of great women across our Cabinet who will be in attendance, so we’ll see you all there.<br>我們內閣中有很多傑出的女性將出席，所以我們到時見。</p><p>And then you’ll also hear from the President again at 4 o’clock when he talks about tariffs.<br>然後你們還會在4點鐘再次聽到總統談論關稅問題。</p><p>So plenty of time for more questions. Sorry it’s a bit shorter today, guys. We’ll see you later.<br>所以還有足夠的時間提更多問題。抱歉今天時間有點短，各位。我們稍後再見。</p>]]></content>

build the car, service the car, and it’s really difficult.<br>然后制造汽车，维修汽车，这真的很难。</p><p>I mean, frankly, the car business is a tough business.<br>我的意思是，坦率地说，汽车行业是一个艰难的行业。</p><p>So, and, you know, there are times when there are rocky moments, like things are, like a little bit of stormy weather.<br>所以，而且，你知道，有时会有艰难的时刻，比如事情进展不顺，就像遇到一点暴风雨天气。</p><p>But what I’m here to tell you is that the future is

we’re accomplishing here.<br>所以，我将回顾我们在这里正在完成的所有事情。</p><p>So, once again, thank you very much.<br>所以，再次感谢大家。</p><p>You know, it’s worth noting that Tesla remains the company of choice for people to work for.<br>你知道，值得注意的是，特斯拉仍然是人们工作的首选公司。</p><p>So, we get millions of applications per year for a very small number of spots.<br>所以，我们每年收到数百万份申请，但只有极少数名额。</p><p>And we continue to be the leading

work, basically.<br>真的，基本上，这是一个很棒的工作场所。</p><p>And because of our growth, there’s a lot of opportunity for upward mobility.<br>而且由于我们的增长，有很多向上流动的机会。</p><p>And I’m going to talk you through just, you know, how I see the future unfolding and why I think it is going to be incredible.<br>我将向您介绍一下，你知道，我如何看待未来的发展，以及为什么我认为它将是令人难以置信的。</p><p>So, first of all, as always, we care a lot about safety, so the safety of our cars and the safety of people within the factory.<br>所以，首先，和往常一样，我们非常关心安全，所以我们汽车的安全和工厂内部人员的安全。</p><p>So, you can see that our work-related injuries have declined over time.<br>所以，你可以看到我们的工伤事故随着时间的推移而减少。</p><p>So, thank you for helping make that happen.<br>所以，感谢你们帮助实现这一点。</p><p>That’s a collaborative effort.<br>这是一项协作努力。</p><p>So, congratulations to the safety team on continuing to improve workplace safety.<br>所以，祝贺安全团队继续提高工作场所安全。</p><p>So, one of the things that may seem like, how do you pull it all together is, you know, where does AI and robots fit in this sort of sustainable energy picture?<br>所以，其中一件事可能看起来像，你如何将所有这些结合在一起，你知道，人工智能和机器人如何融入这种可持续能源的蓝图中？</p><p>Like, is that just like some weird side project or what, you know?<br>就像，这只是某种奇怪的副项目还是什么，你知道吗？</p><p>But it’s because what we’re really aiming for here is, maybe a better way to think about it rather than sustainable energy is sustainable abundance for all.<br>但这因为我们真正追求的是，也许一个更好的思考方式不是可持续能源，而是所有人都可以持续获得丰盈。</p><p>So, if you think about, like, what is the future that would, what’s the most exciting future that you could possibly imagine?<br>所以，如果你想想，比如，什么样的未来会，你所能想象的最令人兴奋的未来是什么？</p><p>Like, what does that future look like?<br>就像，那个未来是什么样的？</p><p>It’s worth thinking about that.<br>值得思考一下。</p><p>Just think, just imagine a future.<br>想想，想象一下未来。</p><p>What does that amazing future look like?<br>那个令人惊叹的未来是什么样的？</p><p>How about a future where you can have any good or service you want, at will?<br>如果未来你可以随意获得任何你想要的商品或服务呢？</p><p>A future of abundance for all, where really anyone can have anything.<br>一个所有人都可以获得丰盈的未来，在那里，真的每个人都可以拥有任何东西。</p><p>It sounds impossible.<br>这听起来不可能。</p><p>It sounds like surely such a thing cannot be the case.<br>这听起来肯定不会是这样的。</p><p>But what I’m here to tell you is that that will indeed be the case.<br>但我要告诉你们的是，情况确实如此。</p><p>That the future we’re headed for is one where you can literally just have anything you want.<br>我们所走向的未来是，你可以真正拥有你想要的任何东西。</p><p>Like, if there’s a good or service you want, you’ll be able to have it, and ultimately everyone in the world will be able to have anything they want.<br>比如，如果你想要某种商品或服务，你就能得到它，最终世界上每个人都能拥有他们想要的任何东西。</p><p>What’s key to that is robotics and AI.<br>其中的关键是机器人技术和人工智能。</p><p>So, once you have self-driving cars and you have autonomous humanoid robots, where everyone can have their own personal C3PO and R2D2, but even better than that, that’s optimus.<br>所以，一旦你拥有了自动驾驶汽车，并且拥有了自主的人形机器人，每个人都可以拥有自己的C3PO和R2D2，甚至比那更好，那就是擎天柱。</p><p>You can imagine, like, your own personal robot buddy that is a great friend but also takes care of your house.<br>你可以想象，比如，你自己的私人机器人伙伴，它是一个好朋友，同时也照顾你的房子。</p><p>Will clean your house, will mow the lawn, will walk the dog, will teach your kids, will babysit, and will also enable the production of goods and services, basically with no limit.<br>会打扫你的房子，会修剪草坪，会遛狗，会教你的孩子，会照顾孩子，还会实现商品和服务的生产，基本上没有限制。</p><p>And when you combine that with sustainable energy from the sun and batteries, we can at the same time also maintain a great environment.<br>当你把这与来自太阳和电池的可持续能源结合起来时，我们也可以同时保持一个良好的环境。</p><p>So that, I think, is the future that we want.<br>所以，我认为，这就是我们想要的未来。</p><p>A future where nobody’s in need.<br>一个没有人需要的未来。</p><p>You can have what you want.<br>你可以拥有你想要的。</p><p>But we still have nature.<br>但我们仍然拥有大自然。</p><p>We still have the beautiful parts of nature that we like.<br>我们仍然拥有我们喜欢的大自然的美丽部分。</p><p>I think that’s probably the best future.<br>我认为这可能是最好的未来。</p><p>What other future would you want?<br>你还想要什么样的未来？</p><p>I think that’s, like, the cool future.<br>我认为，那就像，很酷的未来。</p><p>Space travel, let’s not forget that.<br>太空旅行，让我们不要忘记这一点。</p><p>So if you can have basically anything you want and travel to space and go to Mars, that would be about as good as it gets.<br>所以，如果你基本上可以拥有你想要的任何东西，并且可以去太空旅行，去火星，那就差不多是最好了。</p><p>It’s like, that’s it.<br>就像，就是这样。</p><p>So what we’re trying to do is take the set of actions most likely to lead to a great future for all.<br>所以我们试图做的是采取最有可能为所有人带来美好未来的行动。</p><p>So that’s what I mean by sustainable abundance.<br>所以这就是我所说的可持续丰盈。</p><p>And the combination of things that we’re making with Optimus and AI Compute will achieve an age of abundance for all.<br>我们将使用擎天柱和人工智能计算制造的各种东西的结合将实现所有人的丰盈时代。</p><p>Like, actually.<br>真的。</p><p>So it’s going to be pretty great.<br>所以它会非常棒。</p><p>Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in the world.<br>Model Y 成为世界上最畅销的汽车。</p><p>You know, FYI, we do make the best. How are we doing on popularity?<br>你知道，顺便说一句，我们确实制造了最好的。我们在受欢迎程度方面做得怎么样？</p><p>Well, we actually literally make the best-selling car on Earth of any kind.<br>嗯，实际上，我们确实制造了地球上任何类型的最畅销汽车。</p><p>So that ends for two years in a row.<br>所以，它连续两年都是这样。</p><p>And it’s going to be the best-selling car on Earth again this year.<br>今年它将再次成为地球上最畅销的汽车。</p><p>The Cybertruck became the best-selling electric vehicle pickup instantly, because it’s awesome.<br>Cybertruck 立即成为最畅销的电动皮卡，因为它太棒了。</p><p>And Tesla was the best-selling electric vehicle in Europe, the fastest growing brand in South Korea.<br>特斯拉是欧洲最畅销的电动汽车，也是韩国增长最快的品牌。</p><p>And we launched in a lot of new markets, including Qatar, Lithuania, Chile, and the Philippines.<br>我们进入了很多新市场，包括卡塔尔、立陶宛、智利和菲律宾。</p><p>And we’ll be opening in a whole bunch more markets as well.<br>我们还将在更多市场开设业务。</p><p>So Teslas will be available worldwide.<br>所以特斯拉将在全球范围内销售。</p><p>So overall, you know, it’s good.<br>总的来说，你知道，这很好。</p><p>If you read the news, it feels like, you know, Armageddon.<br>如果你阅读新闻，感觉就像，你知道，世界末日。</p><p>So it’s like, I can’t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.<br>所以就像，我走过电视机前，总是看到一辆特斯拉着火。</p><p>You’re like, what’s going on?<br>你就会想，发生了什么事？</p><p>You know, some people, it’s like, listen, I understand if you don’t want to buy our product, but you don’t have to burn it down, that’s a bit unreasonable, you know.<br>你知道，有些人，就像，听着，我理解如果你不想购买我们的产品，但你不必把它烧掉，这有点不合理，你知道。</p><p>Like, this is psycho.<br>就像，这太疯狂了。</p><p>Still being psycho.<br>还是太疯狂了。</p><p>Okay.<br>好吧。</p><p>So, and we launched the new Model Y. Congrats to the team on Tesla.<br>所以，我们推出了新款Model Y。祝贺特斯拉团队。</p><p>That’s obviously very tough because we’ve got factories all across the world.<br>这显然非常困难，因为我们在世界各地都有工厂。</p><p>And we’ve got a change of a global supply chain on three, basically three supply chains on three continents.<br>而且我们在三个大陆上改变了全球供应链，基本上是三个供应链。</p><p>And I think you did an amazing job of switching over the world’s best-selling car globally in a very short period of time.<br>我认为你们在很短的时间内就在全球范围内完成了世界畅销汽车的转换，做得非常出色。</p><p>Well done, guys.<br>做得好，伙计们。</p><p>And this, I’ll forget, also we upgraded Model 3 last year.<br>还有这个，我会忘记的，我们去年也升级了Model 3。</p><p>So I would encourage people to also buy the Model 3.<br>所以我会鼓励人们也购买Model 3。</p><p>It’s a great car.<br>这是一辆很棒的汽车。</p><p>So, and the Cybertruck has achieved five-star safety.<br>所以，Cybertruck已经获得了五星级安全评级。</p><p>You know, these days, you know, sometimes things get a little dangerous in the neighborhood.<br>你知道，现在，你知道，有时社区里会发生一些危险的事情。</p><p>The Cybertruck, being bulletproof and all, can come in handy.<br>Cybertruck，由于是防弹的，可能会派上用场。</p><p>So, but apart from being bulletproof, it’s also very safe in a crash.<br>所以，但除了防弹之外，它在碰撞中也很安全。</p><p>We’re also building the Tesla Semi Factory.<br>我们还在建造特斯拉Semi工厂。</p><p>This is a vehicle that some people said was impossible to build, that it defied physics.<br>这是一款有些人说不可能建造的汽车，它违背了物理学。</p><p>Well, not only does it not defy physics, we’re going to be making a lot of them.<br>嗯，它不仅没有违背物理学，我们还将制造很多。</p><p>So we’re going to make just a, you know, I think ultimately we’ll make over a million, millions probably, of the Tesla Semi.<br>所以我们将制造，你知道，我认为最终我们将制造超过一百万辆，可能数百万辆的特斯拉Semi。</p><p>And this is really going to be something that you’ll see all over the place.<br>这真的会是你随处可见的东西。</p><p>And it’ll also be autonomous or have the ability to go autonomous down the road.<br>而且它也将是自动的，或者将来具有自动驾驶的能力。</p><p>So, really, autonomy is a massive, massive thing.<br>所以，真的，自主性是一件非常非常重要的事情。</p><p>The future is autonomous.<br>未来是自主的。</p><p>So, I always sort of think, like, what will the future look like in five years or ten years, twenty years?<br>所以，我总是想，比如，五年、十年、二十年后，未来会是什么样？</p><p>And five years from now, autonomous cars are going to be everywhere, primarily going to be Teslas, by the way.<br>五年后，自动驾驶汽车将无处不在，顺便说一句，主要是特斯拉。</p><p>But autonomous Teslas will be everywhere.<br>但自动驾驶特斯拉将无处不在。</p><p>And I think in five years, probably we’ll have regulatory approval, I think globally.<br>我认为五年后，我们可能会获得监管部门的批准，我认为在全球范围内。</p><p>So you’ll have autonomous Teslas on every continent, taking people on trips.<br>所以你将在每个大陆上都看到自动驾驶特斯拉，带着人们去旅行。</p><p>And almost the entire fleet, which will pass ten million vehicles next year, is capable of full autonomy.<br>几乎整个车队，明年将超过1000万辆汽车，都具有完全自主驾驶的能力。</p><p>So even without the cyber cab, we still actually have a gigantic fleet that is capable of being autonomous.<br>所以即使没有cyber cab，我们实际上仍然拥有一支庞大的车队，能够实现自主驾驶。</p><p>And the thing about being an autonomous car is that it can be used much more than a car that is not autonomous.<br>自动驾驶汽车的特点是，它可以比非自动驾驶汽车使用更多。</p><p>A typical passenger vehicle car will be used about ten hours a week.<br>一辆典型的乘用车每周将被使用大约十个小时。</p><p>So people might use it for an hour and a half a day on average for seven days, which is about ten hours a week.<br>所以人们可能会平均每天使用它一个半小时，持续七天，这大约是一周十个小时。</p><p>But there are 168 hours in a week.<br>但一周有168个小时。</p><p>So if you have a car that’s a robot car that can drive autonomously, it can now be used potentially for 80, maybe 100 hours a week.<br>所以如果你有一辆可以自动驾驶的机器人汽车，它现在每周可能会被使用80个小时，甚至100个小时。</p><p>So you could have a car that has ten times the usefulness of a non-autonomous car, but it still costs the same.<br>所以你可以拥有一辆其效用是非自动驾驶汽车十倍的汽车，但它的成本仍然相同。</p><p>In fact, the fleet’s already built.<br>事实上，车队已经建成。</p><p>So the software update just enables that capability.<br>所以软件更新只是启用了该功能。</p><p>Overnight, you have an increase in usefulness of ten million cars that suddenly become like 50 million cars or maybe 80 or 100 million cars of usefulness overnight.<br>一夜之间，你有了一千万辆汽车的效用增加，突然变得像五千万辆汽车，甚至八千万或一亿辆汽车的效用一夜之间。</p><p>That’s a profound thing.<br>这是一件深刻的事情。</p><p>Nothing like that has ever happened before.<br>以前从未发生过类似的事情。</p><p>There is no analogy that there’s no, there’s never been something where a software update increased the value of a gigantic asset base by a factor of like 500 to 1,000 percent.<br>没有类比，从来没有任何东西，软件更新将一个巨大的资产基础的价值提高了500%到1000%。</p><p>So it’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rear view mirror.<br>所以对于股市中的人来说，这非常困难，尤其是那些只看后视镜的人。</p><p>Which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a ten million vehicle fleet has five to ten times the usefulness.<br>大多数人，难以想象一个未来，突然拥有一千万辆汽车的车队具有五到十倍的效用。</p><p>It’s so profound and there’s no comparison with anything in the past that they just can’t, it does not compute.<br>这是如此深刻，而且与过去没有任何可比性，他们只是无法理解，它无法计算。</p><p>But it will compute in the future.<br>但它会在未来计算出来。</p><p>And some people like Kathy Wood at ARK Invest do see the future.<br>一些像ARK Invest的凯西·伍德这样的人确实看到了未来。</p><p>So what I’m saying is hang on to your stock.<br>所以我想说的是，坚持持有你的股票。</p><p>So, yeah, it’s really, it’s mind blowing.<br>所以，是的，这真的令人难以置信。</p><p>Then I want to give a shout out to service.<br>然后我想对服务部门表示敬意。</p><p>Service is a tough job, an important job, and it’s actually what sells cars long term.<br>服务是一项艰巨的工作，一项重要的工作，它实际上是长期销售汽车的原因。</p><p>You know, because the initial car is sold with sales, but all future cars are sold with service.<br>你知道，因为最初的汽车是通过销售售出的，但所有未来的汽车都是通过服务售出的。</p><p>And I always encourage our service team, like, let’s try to give people a service experience that they love.<br>我总是鼓励我们的服务团队，比如，让我们尝试给人们一种他们喜欢的服务体验。</p><p>Not merely that they like, but that they love.<br>不仅仅是他们喜欢，而是他们热爱。</p><p>Because people will talk about something that they love that was an amazing experience, but they don’t talk that much about things that they like.<br>因为人们会谈论他们喜欢的东西，那是一种很棒的体验，但他们不会过多地谈论他们喜欢的东西。</p><p>You have to really do something amazing.<br>你必须真正做一些令人惊叹的事情。</p><p>And then they’ll talk about it and be like, wow, that’s incredible.<br>然后他们会谈论它，然后说，哇，这太不可思议了。</p><p>So thank you to the service team for the great job you do.<br>所以感谢服务团队你们的出色工作。</p><p>And you can see sort of, I like this light map of superchargers.<br>你可以看到，我喜欢这张超级充电站的光照地图。</p><p>You can see you can go practically anywhere in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, China.<br>你可以看到，你几乎可以去美国的任何地方，墨西哥，欧洲，中国。</p><p>Well, I guess not the outback of Australia.<br>嗯，我想不是澳大利亚的内陆地区。</p><p>But, you know, most of the places where people live.<br>但是，你知道，大多数人居住的地方。</p><p>So our supercharger network continues to grow significantly.<br>所以我们的超级充电站网络继续显着增长。</p><p>And we keep upgrading our superchargers.<br>我们不断升级我们的超级充电站。</p><p>In fact, I still run into a lot of people who don’t realize that you can drive.<br>事实上，我仍然遇到很多人，他们没有意识到你可以开车。</p><p>You can take your Tesla on a road trip anywhere in America or anywhere in Europe, anywhere, pretty much anywhere in China, just using the Tesla supercharger network.<br>你可以驾驶你的特斯拉去美国或欧洲的任何地方旅行，几乎可以在中国的任何地方旅行，只需使用特斯拉的超级充电站网络。</p><p>And it’s actually easy and convenient.<br>而且它实际上很容易和方便。</p><p>So people think that whatever the range of the car is, that’s as far as they can go.<br>所以人们认为无论汽车的续航里程是多少，他们只能走那么远。</p><p>It’s like, no, you just stop at a supercharger network.<br>就像，不，你只需在超级充电站网络停下来。</p><p>The car’s battery will last longer than your bladder.<br>汽车的电池比你的膀胱持续的时间更长。</p><p>I’m pretty confident.<br>我非常有信心。</p><p>So that’s really the threshold.<br>所以这才是真正的门槛。</p><p>As long as the car battery lasts longer than your bladder and you just plug it in when you go to the restroom and you come back and grab a coffee.<br>只要汽车电池的持续时间比你的膀胱长，而且你在去洗手间时把它插上，然后你回来喝杯咖啡。</p><p>Or whatever and you’re back on the road and everything’s good.<br>或者不管什么，你回到路上，一切都很好。</p><p>Then that’s the range that matters and the supercharging speed that matters.<br>那么这就是重要的续航里程和重要的超级充电速度。</p><p>So, yes, so congrats to the supercharger team on expanding that work.<br>所以，是的，所以祝贺超级充电站团队扩展了这项工作。</p><p>You did great work there.<br>你们在那里做了很棒的工作。</p><p>And then, I mean, the MegaPak and PowerWall team are really knocking it out of the park.<br>然后，我的意思是，MegaPak和PowerWall团队真的做得非常出色。</p><p>The demand for stationary battery storage is gigantic.<br>对固定电池存储的需求是巨大的。</p><p>And I think that is actually only going to increase dramatically over time.<br>我认为随着时间的推移，这种情况只会大幅增加。</p><p>So, and we’ve got the Shanghai MegaFactory that got started in record time in February.<br>所以，我们在二月份开设了上海MegaFactory，该工厂在创纪录的时间内启动。</p><p>Congrats to the Shanghai factory team there.<br>祝贺上海工厂团队。</p><p>That’s awesome.<br>太棒了。</p><p>And the PowerWall 3 is, it usually takes about three major technology iterations for the product to be great.<br>PowerWall 3通常需要大约三个主要的技术迭代，产品才能变得很棒。</p><p>And the PowerWall 3 really is a fantastic home energy product.<br>PowerWall 3确实是一款出色的家用能源产品。</p><p>And it’s something that if you want to ensure that your home has uninterrupted power during a power outage, the PowerWall 3 is the way to go.<br>如果你想确保你的家在停电期间拥有不间断的电力，PowerWall 3是一个不错的选择。</p><p>And if you combine that with solar, you can basically be off-grid, which is pretty cool.<br>如果你把它与太阳能结合起来，你基本上可以脱离电网，这非常酷。</p><p>But I think just having energy insurance, like being, or energy assurance, such that if the utility goes down, you don’t even notice.<br>但我认为仅仅拥有能源保险，或者说是能源保障，这样，如果公用事业公司倒闭了，你甚至不会注意到。</p><p>Like the lights are on in your house and your neighbors will come to you for help, basically.<br>就像你家里的灯亮着，你的邻居会来找你帮忙，基本上就是这样。</p><p>That’s actually what happens when somebody has a Tesla PowerWall and there’s a power outage.<br>当有人拥有特斯拉PowerWall并且停电时，实际上会发生这种情况。</p><p>So that’s a great product.<br>所以这是一个很棒的产品。</p><p>And then, yeah, MegaPak, especially at the utility scale, is the opportunity there is gigantic because it enables a utility grid to dramatically increase the output of electricity.<br>然后，是的，MegaPak，尤其是在公用事业规模上，那里的机会是巨大的，因为它使公用事业电网能够显着提高电力输出。</p><p>Because you can generate electricity at night and then MegaPak can provide that electricity during the day because normal electricity demand is very uneven.<br>因为你可以在晚上发电，然后MegaPak可以在白天提供电力，因为正常的电力需求非常不均衡。</p><p>There’s a lot of electricity usage during the day, but limited at night.<br>白天有很多电力使用，但在晚上有限制。</p><p>So MegaPak actually has the potential to increase the output of an existing electricity grid by more than double.<br>所以MegaPak实际上有潜力将现有电网的输出增加一倍以上。</p><p>So you can actually, without building additional power plants, double the total output of energy in a year.<br>所以你实际上可以在不建造额外发电厂的情况下，将一年的总能量输出增加一倍。</p><p>So that’s quite a profound thing.<br>所以这是一件非常深刻的事情。</p><p>Yeah, so MegaPak is also really good at stabilizing the grid.<br>是的，所以MegaPak也非常擅长稳定电网。</p><p>So if there’s variations in power in the grid, the MegaPak can absorb.<br>所以如果电网中的电力有变化，MegaPak可以吸收。</p><p>If there’s a big power spike, it can absorb and store the power.<br>如果出现大的电力尖峰，它可以吸收和存储电力。</p><p>And then if there’s a drop in power, it can fill in the gap.<br>然后如果电力下降，它可以填补空白。</p><p>So MegaPak is excellent for stabilizing the grid and obviously it matches very well with wind and solar.<br>所以MegaPak非常适合稳定电网，显然它与风能和太阳能非常匹配。</p><p>In fact, satellites are just solar panels and a battery.<br>事实上，卫星只是太阳能电池板和电池。</p><p>That’s how all satellites work.<br>所有卫星都是这样工作的。</p><p>And with the Starlink satellite network, there’s 7,000 satellites orbiting the Earth, and all they use is solar panels and a battery.<br>使用Starlink卫星网络，有7,000颗卫星绕地球运行，它们使用的只是太阳能电池板和电池。</p><p>My prediction is long term, a majority of power on Earth.<br>我的预测是长期来看，地球上的大部分电力。</p><p>In fact, eventually it might be like 90% or more of all power on Earth will be solar panels with batteries.<br>事实上，最终可能地球上90%甚至更多的电力将是太阳能电池板和电池。</p><p>That’s my prediction.<br>这是我的预测。</p><p>My predictions have pretty good track record.<br>我的预测有很好的记录。</p><p>So yeah, and the power walls can also act as kind of a virtual grid.<br>所以是的，电源墙也可以充当一种虚拟电网。</p><p>If you have thousands of power walls in a neighborhood, they can actually work in concert to stabilize the grid.<br>如果你在一个社区里有成千上万个电源墙，它们实际上可以协同工作来稳定电网。</p><p>The V4 supercharger is pretty cool.<br>V4超级充电站非常酷。</p><p>It enables charging at 500 kilowatts and the Semi can charge at 1.2 megawatts.<br>它可以实现500千瓦的充电，Semi可以实现1.2兆瓦的充电。</p><p>And it’s smaller and lighter.<br>它更小更轻。</p><p>It’s a big improvement overall.<br>总体来说是一个很大的改进。</p><p>And we’re rolling this out worldwide.<br>我们正在全球范围内推广它。</p><p>So it will increase charging speeds and just enable you to get your car charged really fast.<br>所以它将提高充电速度，让你能够非常快地为你的汽车充电。</p><p>And then with regard to cell manufacturing, at this point we think we’re making the most efficient cell in the world.<br>然后关于电池制造，在这一点上，我们认为我们正在制造世界上效率最高的电池。</p><p>Meaning like the lowest cost per kilowatt hour cell, which is really pretty good.<br>意味着每千瓦时电池的成本最低，这真的非常好。</p><p>There are entire companies that all they do is make lithium ion battery cells.<br>有很多公司，他们所做的就是制造锂离子电池。</p><p>And for us that’s one of many things that we do.<br>对我们来说，这是我们所做的许多事情之一。</p><p>So congratulations to the cell team on making the best cell.<br>所以祝贺电池团队制造出最好的电池。</p><p>So that’s a really big deal.<br>所以这是一件非常重要的事情。</p><p>And then we’re also investing in the whole battery supply chain.<br>然后我们还在投资整个电池供应链。</p><p>So we have cathode production, we have lithium refining, and then more.<br>所以我们有正极生产，我们有锂提炼，然后更多。</p><p>Yeah, hopefully.<br>是的，希望如此。</p><p>We’re sort of hoping someone else will do the anode.<br>我们有点希望其他人来做负极。</p><p>We might have to do the anode.<br>我们可能不得不做负极。</p><p>I hope someone else does it.<br>我希望其他人来做。</p><p>Why do we have to do all these things?<br>我们为什么要做到所有这些事情？</p><p>A lot of people think we do a lot of these things because we want to, but really it’s often just because we didn’t have any choice and nobody else was doing it, so we had to do it.<br>很多人认为我们做很多这些事情是因为我们想这样做，但实际上通常只是因为我们别无选择，而且没有人这样做，所以我们不得不这样做。</p><p>So a lot of new factory milestones.<br>所以很多新的工厂里程碑。</p><p>So in Berlin we produced 660,000 drive units.<br>所以在柏林，我们生产了66万个驱动单元。</p><p>In Fremont we built our first Optimus at the Optimus production line in Fremont.<br>在弗里蒙特，我们在弗里蒙特的擎天柱生产线上建造了我们的第一个擎天柱。</p><p>We were preparing for cybercap production here at Gigafactory Austin.<br>我们正在奥斯汀超级工厂准备进行cybercap的生产。</p><p>And Gigafactory Shanghai created its 3 millionth car.<br>上海超级工厂生产了第300万辆汽车。</p><p>We’ve produced 160,000 Naxx adapters at Gigafactory New York.<br>我们在纽约超级工厂生产了16万个Naxx适配器。</p><p>And we’ve got record battery pack production at Gigafactory Nevada.<br>我们在内华达超级工厂实现了创纪录的电池组生产。</p><p>So congrats to everyone.<br>所以祝贺大家。</p><p>We also just behind us on the south side of the building we have the Tesla, we call Cortex-1.<br>我们还在我们身后，建筑南侧，我们拥有特斯拉，我们称之为Cortex-1。</p><p>It’s basically a giant brain, computer brain, that is used for AI training.<br>它基本上是一个巨大的大脑，电脑大脑，用于人工智能训练。</p><p>So we take the vast amounts of video that we get from all the cars in the fleet, and we use that to train the artificial intelligence to be able to drive the car.<br>所以我们从车队中的所有汽车中获取大量视频，并使用它来训练人工智能，使其能够驾驶汽车。</p><p>And this is one of the most powerful training systems in the world with over 50,000 GPUs active and soon to be 100,000 GPUs.<br>拥有超过50,000个活跃的GPU，很快将达到100,000个GPU，这是世界上最强大的训练系统之一。</p><p>Which will make it I think probably top five in the world in training centers.<br>我认为这将使其成为世界训练中心的前五名。</p><p>We’re also continuing to make progress on our Dojo training supercomputer.<br>我们还在我们的Dojo训练超级计算机上继续取得进展。</p><p>So we’ve got Dojo 1 active now in Gigafactory New York and Palo Alto.<br>所以我们现在在纽约超级工厂和帕洛阿尔托都启动了Dojo 1。</p><p>And it is actively working.<br>它正在积极工作。</p><p>It’s actually taking load on, it’s doing a meaningful percentage, well, I guess 5% or whatever.<br>它实际上正在承担负载，它正在做有意义的百分比，好吧，我猜是5%或其他。</p><p>But it’s still something, 5%, maybe approaching 10% of the training load of the self-driving AI is being done by Dojo.<br>但这仍然很重要，5%，可能接近自动驾驶人工智能的训练负载的10%是由Dojo完成的。</p><p>And then we’ve got Dojo 2 that’s coming down the line.<br>然后我们还有即将推出的Dojo 2。</p><p>That’ll be probably 10 times better than Dojo 1.<br>那可能会比Dojo 1好10倍。</p><p>And so it’s sort of exciting.<br>所以这有点令人兴奋。</p><p>We’re making good progress with Dojo.<br>我们在Dojo方面取得了良好的进展。</p><p>I’m increasingly optimistic about the future of Dojo.<br>我对Dojo的未来越来越乐观。</p><p>I think it’s, we’ve got a real shot here at a breakthrough.<br>我认为这是，我们在这里有真正的突破机会。</p><p>So congrats to the Dojo team.<br>所以祝贺Dojo团队。</p><p>And all Tesla vehicles have now had what we call Autopilot Hardware 4, or really our AI 4 hardware.<br>现在所有特斯拉汽车都配备了我们所谓的自动驾驶硬件4，或者实际上是我们的AI 4硬件。</p><p>And it’s really, it’s a very powerful AI-inferenced computer, but also operates at very low power.<br>这确实是一个非常强大的AI推理计算机，但也以非常低的功耗运行。</p><p>And even to this day, even though this has been something we designed several years ago, there actually isn’t anything on the market that we can buy that is better than AI 4.<br>即使到了今天，即使这是我们几年前设计的东西，实际上市场上没有任何我们可以购买的东西比AI 4更好。</p><p>So, and obviously in the future years we’ll have AI 5 and AI 6.<br>所以，显然在未来的几年里，我们将拥有AI 5和AI 6。</p><p>Sometimes people say, “Should I wait?”<br>有时人们会说，“我应该等待吗？”</p><p>I’m like, “Well, we’re always going to have another version, so there’s no point in waiting because we’re always waiting forever.”<br>我就像，“嗯，我们总会有另一个版本，所以没有必要等待，因为我们总是永远在等待。”</p><p>So, but we obviously will have an AI 5 and an AI 6 and an AI 7, and we’ll keep improving the AI compute.<br>所以，但我们显然会有AI 5和AI 6和AI 7，我们将继续改进AI计算。</p><p>So for those out there that are interested in developing advanced chips, come work at Tesla.<br>所以对于那些有兴趣开发高级芯片的人，来特斯拉工作吧。</p><p>And it is always, I think, profound to watch our cars driving with no one in them.<br>而且我认为，观看我们的汽车在没有人的情况下驾驶总是令人深刻的。</p><p>And we actually have the cars doing useful work for the first time with no one in them, which I think is really, it’s a significant milestone.<br>我们实际上第一次让汽车在没有人的情况下做有用的工作，我认为这真的很重要，这是一个重要的里程碑。</p><p>So the cars are driving from end of line in Fremont to park themselves, and I think we’ve just started doing that here in Austin.<br>所以汽车从弗里蒙特的生产线下线后自己开到停车位，而且我认为我们刚刚开始在奥斯汀做这件事。</p><p>So we’ll be, yeah, the car literally goes from end of line in Fremont to its destination parking spot.<br>所以我们会，是的，汽车确实从弗里蒙特的生产线下线后开到它的目的地停车位。</p><p>Where it gets picked up by a truck for delivery to a customer, and it does that with no one in it.<br>在那里它被卡车接走，运送给客户，而且它在没有人的情况下完成这件事。</p><p>And it’s not doing that all day every day.<br>而且它不是每天都这样做。</p><p>Like, you know, pretty much like it’s just a matter of fact thing.<br>就像，你知道，几乎就像这是一件理所当然的事情。</p><p>Yeah.<br>是的。</p><p>So, let’s see.<br>所以，让我们看看。</p><p>Yeah, and obviously for anyone that’s using it, you can see the dramatic improvements in the, in full self-driving.<br>是的，显然对于任何正在使用它的人来说，你可以看到完全自动驾驶方面的巨大改进。</p><p>Where it’s getting to the point where interventions are extremely rare, and eventually I get to the point where there really is no need to intervene.<br>它正在达到干预非常罕见的程度，最终我会达到真正不需要干预的程度。</p><p>Like, the car is going to be better than human.<br>就像，汽车将比人类更好。</p><p>In fact, maybe it’s worth emphasizing that it’s not that Tesla full self-driving will be equal to humans in safety.<br>事实上，也许值得强调的是，特斯拉完全自动驾驶在安全性方面不会等于人类。</p><p>It will be ultimately 10 times safer than a human, because it never gets tired.<br>它最终将比人类安全10倍，因为它永远不会感到疲倦。</p><p>It doesn’t, you know, like, humans get tired and sometimes get wasted, you know.<br>它不会，你知道，就像，人类会感到疲倦，有时会浪费时间，你知道。</p><p>And we’ll have arguments or change the radio or, you know, text.<br>我们会争论或更换收音机或，你知道，发短信。</p><p>I know no one in this audience would ever text while driving.<br>我知道在座的各位都不会在开车时发短信。</p><p>That would be crazy.<br>那太疯狂了。</p><p>But, you know, it does happen.<br>但是，你知道，它确实会发生。</p><p>So, the reality is that the Tesla full self-driving will be vastly safer than humans.<br>所以，现实情况是特斯拉完全自动驾驶将比人类安全得多。</p><p>Not just equivalent, but actually vastly safer.<br>不仅仅是等同，而是实际上安全得多。</p><p>And it means you can do whatever you want while driving.<br>这意味着你可以在驾驶时做任何你想做的事情。</p><p>So, even if you don’t, like, rent your car out for usage, you can still, it frees up your time.<br>所以，即使你不，比如，出租你的汽车供使用，你仍然可以，它释放了你的时间。</p><p>So, let’s say you’re driving 10, 12 hours a week or more, it gives you back 10 to 12 hours of your life, which is extremely cool.<br>所以，假设你每周驾驶10到12个小时或更多，它会让你找回10到12个小时的生命，这非常酷。</p><p>So, well, Optimus sure has come a long way.<br>所以，擎天柱确实走了很长的路。</p><p>So, the new Optimus 22 degree of freedom hand and forearm is now in production.<br>所以，新的擎天柱22自由度手和前臂现在正在生产中。</p><p>And it’s learning to walk and catch balls.<br>它正在学习走路和接球。</p><p>It’s pretty cool.<br>这非常酷。</p><p>I mean, look, that’s where we came from.<br>我的意思是，看看，那是我们来自的地方。</p><p>It’s wild.<br>这太疯狂了。</p><p>So, in a very short period of time, Optimus has gone from being an idea to the most sophisticated humanoid robot on Earth.<br>所以，在很短的时间内，擎天柱已经从一个想法变成了地球上最复杂的人形机器人。</p><p>There’s nothing even close to the level of sophistication of Optimus.<br>没有什么能接近擎天柱的复杂程度。</p><p>And Tesla has some important missing ingredients that others don’t have, which is our robot has a real brain.<br>特斯拉拥有其他公司没有的一些重要的缺失要素，那就是我们的机器人拥有一个真正的大脑。</p><p>It’s like Wizard of Oz, Tin Man.<br>就像绿野仙踪，铁皮人。</p><p>Was that a heart or a brain?<br>那是一个心脏还是一个大脑？</p><p>One of the two.<br>两者之一。</p><p>So, it’s got the real world AI.<br>所以，它拥有真实世界的人工智能。</p><p>So, Tesla’s the leader in real world AI.<br>所以，特斯拉是真实世界人工智能的领导者。</p><p>What we learned from the car, we translate to the Optimus robot.<br>我们从汽车中学到的东西，我们转化为擎天柱机器人。</p><p>We also take our expertise in electric motors, in batteries, power electronics, structural design.<br>我们还运用我们在电动机、电池、电力电子、结构设计方面的专业知识。</p><p>And then another major important thing is that we’re very good at manufacturing.<br>然后另一件主要重要的事情是，我们非常擅长制造。</p><p>So, in order for robots to be useful, they have to be intelligent.<br>所以，为了使机器人有用，它们必须是智能的。</p><p>They have to be able to do useful things just by asking.<br>它们必须能够通过询问来做有用的事情。</p><p>And you have to be able to make a large number of them at an affordable price.<br>你必须能够以合理的价格制造大量它们。</p><p>This is what we can do.<br>这就是我们能做的事情。</p><p>The only company with all the ingredients for making intelligent humanoid robots at scale is Tesla.<br>唯一一家拥有大规模制造智能人形机器人的所有要素的公司是特斯拉。</p><p>This is a super big deal.<br>这是一件非常重要的事情。</p><p>My prediction on this front is that Optimus will be the biggest product of all time by far.<br>我对这方面的预测是，擎天柱将成为有史以来最大的产品。</p><p>Nothing will even be close.<br>没有什么可以接近它。</p><p>I think it will be 10 times bigger than the next biggest product ever made.<br>我认为它将比有史以来第二大的产品大10倍。</p><p>Like that level.<br>就像那个级别。</p><p>All right.<br>好的。</p><p>So, with that, anybody have any questions?<br>所以，有了这些，有人有任何问题吗？</p><p>Congratulations.<br>恭喜。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p><p>Cool.<br>酷。</p><p>And we rocket castings.<br>我们进行火箭铸造。</p><p>We do.<br>我们是的。</p><p>Well, we do want to scale up production to new heights.<br>嗯，我们确实想将生产扩大到新的高度。</p><p>Obviously, with the CyberCab, we’re going to be.<br>显然，有了CyberCab，我们将会这样做。  </p><p>The CyberCab is not just revolutionary car design, it’s also a revolutionary manufacturing process.<br>CyberCab不仅仅是革命性的汽车设计，也是一个革命性的制造过程。  </p><p>So, I guess we probably don’t talk about that enough.<br>所以，我想我们可能没有足够地谈论这个。</p><p>But if you’ve seen the design of the CyberCab line, it doesn’t look like a normal car manufacturing line.<br>但是如果你看过CyberCab生产线的设计，它看起来不像普通的汽车生产线。</p><p>It looks like a really high speed consumer electronics line.<br>它看起来像一条非常高速的消费电子产品线。</p><p>In fact, the line will move so fast that actually people can’t even get close to it.<br>事实上，这条生产线移动得如此之快，以至于实际上人们甚至无法靠近它。</p><p>Like that’s. I think it’ll be able to produce a car ultimately in less than five seconds.<br>就像那样。我认为它最终能够在大约不到五秒钟的时间内生产一辆汽车。</p><p>Can you imagine a car coming off the line in less than five seconds?<br>你能想象一辆汽车在不到五秒钟的时间内下线吗？</p><p>That’s like, whoa.<br>就像，哇。</p><p>Which means casting’s got to happen fast.<br>这意味着铸造必须快速进行。</p><p>Yeah, yeah.<br>是的，是的。</p><p>We’ve got to jam the liquid metal in, cool it down real fast, real fast.<br>我们必须将液态金属注入，并以非常快的速度冷却它。</p><p>And then, I guess maybe we need to just get even bigger casting machines?<br>然后，我想也许我们只需要获得更大的铸造机？</p><p>Sure, why not?<br>当然，为什么不呢？</p><p>Down, yeah, let’s. 50,000 tons.<br>好，是的，让我们。50,000吨。</p><p>Because then we can make, in a single casting machine, we could do five at a time or something.<br>因为这样我们就可以在一台铸造机中一次做五个或其他。</p><p>I’m trying to think, how do you scale castings?<br>我正在想，你如何扩大铸造规模？</p><p>Because you’ve got liquid metal, metal’s got to cool.<br>因为你有液态金属，金属必须冷却。</p><p>And then you’ve got automate, getting all the bits and pieces off the casting so it’s usable.<br>然后你必须自动化，将铸件上的所有碎片都移除，使其可用。</p><p>And that’s actually kind of how they do it in small volume castings.<br>这实际上是他们如何在小批量铸造中做到这一点。</p><p>They’ll have a casting block that’ll make 100 Matchbox cars at a time.<br>他们将有一个铸造块，一次可以制作100辆火柴盒汽车。</p><p>Maybe we’ll just make that real big.<br>也许我们只是把它做大。</p><p>I mean, we have the Cathedral of Casting back there.<br>我的意思是，我们后面有铸造大教堂。</p><p>So, yeah, let’s do that.<br>所以，是的，让我们这样做。</p><p>I mean, let’s see, what is the limit of physics of how big can a casting machine be?<br>我的意思是，让我们看看，物理学对铸造机的尺寸限制是什么？</p><p>Let’s find out.<br>让我们找出答案。</p><p>I’m down.<br>我愿意。</p><p>Let’s have some fun here.<br>让我们在这里玩得开心。</p><p>Limits of technology.<br>技术的限制。</p><p>All right.<br>好的。</p><p>Hi, Elon.<br>你好，埃隆。</p><p>I’ve been with Tesla for the last eight years.<br>我已经在特斯拉工作了八年。</p><p>It has been the most exhilarating eight years of my career.<br>这是我职业生涯中最令人振奋的八年。</p><p>And truly want to thank you for your leadership.<br>而且我真心感谢你的领导。</p><p>I also have two little, Thank you for your contribution.<br>我也有两个小，感谢您的贡献。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p><p>Thank you for your leadership.<br>感谢您的领导。</p><p>I also have two little girls who spend their weekends cruising around in their very awesome Cybertruck.<br>我也有两个小女孩，她们在周末驾驶着她们非常棒的Cybertruck四处游玩。</p><p>I’d love to know when we can add Optimus to the family.<br>我很想知道我们什么时候可以把擎天柱加入到家庭中。</p><p>Oh, yeah, that’s a good question.<br>哦，是的，这是一个好问题。</p><p>So this year we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots.<br>所以今年我们有望能够制造大约5,000个擎天柱机器人。</p><p>Technically, we’re aiming for enough parts to make 10,000, maybe 12,000.<br>从技术上讲，我们的目标是有足够的零件来制造10,000个，甚至12,000个。</p><p>But since it’s a totally new product with totally new, like everything is totally new, I’ll say like we’re succeeding if we get to half of the 10,000.<br>但由于这是一个全新的产品，拥有全新的，就像一切都是全新的，我会说，如果我们能达到10,000个的一半，我们就成功了。</p><p>But even 5,000 robots, that’s the size of a Roman legion, FYI.<br>但即使是5,000个机器人，也相当于一个罗马军团的规模，仅供参考。</p><p>Which is like a little scary thought, like a whole legion of robots.<br>这有点可怕的想法，就像一个完整的机器人军团。</p><p>I’d be like, whoa.<br>我会想，哇。</p><p>But I think we’ll literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year.<br>但我认为我们今年将真正建造一个军团，至少一个机器人军团。</p><p>And then probably 10 legions next year.<br>然后明年可能会有10个军团。</p><p>That’s kind of a cool unit, you know.<br>这是一种很酷的单位，你知道。</p><p>Units of legion.<br>军团单位。</p><p>So probably 50,000-ish next year.<br>所以明年可能大约有50,000个。</p><p>And then it’s probably ready for, I’m hopefully ready for Optimus to be used outside of Tesla-controlled environment.<br>然后它可能已经准备好了，我希望已经准备好擎天柱在特斯拉控制环境之外使用。</p><p>Maybe around the middle of next year, second half of next year sometime.<br>可能在明年年中左右，明年下半年某个时候。</p><p>So I think that sounds about right.<br>所以我认为这听起来差不多。</p><p>Probably second half of next year is when they’ll be available.<br>可能在明年下半年它们就可以使用了。</p><p>And then we will offer Optimus robots first to Tesla employees.<br>然后我们将首先向特斯拉员工提供擎天柱机器人。</p><p>So you guys get priority.<br>所以你们优先。</p><p>There are some pluses and minuses to that, you know.<br>你知道，这有一些优点和缺点。</p><p>Because it’s, probably have a few bugs, but it’s going to be very cool.<br>因为，可能有一些错误，但它会非常酷。</p><p>You’ll definitely want to invite your friends over and say, check this out.<br>你肯定会想邀请你的朋友过来，然后说，看看这个。</p><p>So that’s the other questions.<br>所以这是其他问题。</p><p>Hi, Elon.<br>你好，埃隆。</p><p>Hey.<br>嘿。</p><p>My name’s Dom.<br>我叫多姆。</p><p>I’ve been here for a little over a year now.<br>我在这里工作了一年多。</p><p>I work in people development.<br>我从事人员发展工作。</p><p>We try to, we make so many amazing things.<br>我们试图，我们制造了很多令人惊叹的东西。</p><p>Right now it’s still the people that do it.<br>现在仍然是人们在做这件事。</p><p>Yes.<br>是的。</p><p>When we think about applying first principles to the relationships and the teams that people have.<br>当我们考虑将第一性原理应用于人际关系和团队时。</p><p>How would you encourage us to think about that and act on those first principles when it comes to relationships and teams?<br>你将如何鼓励我们思考这个问题，并在人际关系和团队方面按照这些第一性原理行事？</p><p>Hmm.<br>嗯。</p><p>Well, I think, you know, there are actually quite a few things I’ve written over the years that it would be good to compile into like a booklet or something.<br>嗯，我认为，你知道，实际上我多年来写了很多东西，最好将它们整理成一本小册子之类的东西。</p><p>Because I actually have to be reminded of those things myself.<br>因为实际上我必须自己记住这些事情。</p><p>And I’m like, oh, I remember that thing that I thought of after making so many mistakes and trying to make fewer mistakes.<br>我就像，哦，我记得在犯了这么多错误并试图减少错误之后，我想到的那件事。</p><p>So, you know, there’s like, for example, a five-step process of like make the requirements less dumb and then try to delete the part and process step.<br>所以，你知道，例如，有一个五步过程，比如让需求不那么愚蠢，然后尝试删除零件和过程步骤。</p><p>Only then optimize, only then speed it up, and only the fifth thing is automate.<br>只有这样才能优化，只有这样才能加速，只有第五件事是自动化。</p><p>I have to repeat that to myself many times because I’ve made the mistake of doing it backwards so many times.<br>我必须多次对自己重复这一点，因为我犯了很多次倒着做的错误。</p><p>And, you know, I think always operating on the principle that everyone is wrong to some degree and we should aspire to be less wrong over time.<br>而且，你知道，我认为始终按照每个人在某种程度上都是错误的原则运作，我们应该渴望随着时间的推移变得不那么错误。</p><p>Which we will not always succeed in doing.<br>我们不会总是成功做到这一点。</p><p>But if, you know, if two days out of three you’re less wrong over time, you’re going to be, your batting average is going to be really good.<br>但是，你知道，如果三天中有两天你随着时间的推移变得不那么错误，你就会，你的击球率会非常好。</p><p>So nobody ever bats a thousand, but you can improve your batting average.<br>所以没有人能达到1000分，但你可以提高你的击球率。</p><p>So I think rigorous, you know, you want to critique yourself, you want to internalize responsibility.<br>所以我认为严格的，你知道，你想批评自己，你想内化责任。</p><p>And these are all things I need to remind myself of, you know, just to be clear.<br>而且这些都是我需要提醒自己的事情，你知道，为了清楚起见。</p><p>I don’t want to like suggesting I, internalize responsibility.<br>我不希望像建议我，内化责任。</p><p>Be less wrong.<br>少犯错误。</p><p>And we should remember what is our goal as a company.<br>我们应该记住我们作为公司的目标是什么。</p><p>Our goal is to make amazing products that people love and then to take care of those products and service.<br>我们的目标是制造人们喜爱的惊人产品，然后照顾这些产品和服务。</p><p>So we should say what are we doing to make our products better, to make them affordable, to have the customer experience be delightful.<br>所以我们应该说我们正在做什么来使我们的产品更好，使它们负担得起，使客户体验令人愉快。</p><p>Because that’s actually the purpose of a company.<br>因为这实际上是公司的目的。</p><p>Sometimes people get why does a company exist?<br>有时人们会想，公司为什么存在？</p><p>A company exists, it’s a group of people collected together to produce a compelling product or service that others find useful.<br>公司的存在，是一群人聚集在一起，生产出引人注目的产品或服务，其他人觉得有用。</p><p>And where the value of the product and service is greater than the cost of what it took to make that product or service.<br>而且产品和服务的价值大于制造该产品或服务所需的成本。</p><p>So sometimes weirdly profit is viewed negatively.<br>所以有时奇怪的是，利润被负面看待。</p><p>But really profit is just the difference in value between the output and the input.<br>但实际上利润只是产出和投入之间的价值差异。</p><p>It’s like what did it cost you to make it and what did it cost you, and what are people prepared to pay for it?<br>就像你制造它花了多少钱，它花了你多少钱，以及人们准备为此付出多少钱？</p><p>That’s the value that you created.<br>那是你创造的价值。</p><p>So it’s tough actually even to maintain like a 10% profitability, which is to make the output 10% more valuable than the input.<br>所以实际上即使要保持像10%的盈利能力也很困难，即要使产出比投入更有价值10%。</p><p>It’s actually quite hard, especially in the car industry, which is very competitive.<br>这实际上非常困难，尤其是在竞争激烈的汽车行业。</p><p>So we should just not lose sight of like why are we here?<br>所以我们不应该忘记我们为什么在这里？</p><p>We’re here to make useful products that people love and take care of them over time.<br>我们在这里制造人们喜爱的有用产品，并随着时间的推移照顾它们。</p><p>So then how are we doing in that respect and how can we do that better?<br>所以我们在这方面做得怎么样？我们如何才能做得更好？</p><p>Sure.<br>当然。</p><p>What advice would you give a young person like getting into the stock market?<br>你会给一个刚进入股市的年轻人什么建议？</p><p>Oh, stock advice.<br>哦，股票建议。</p><p>Wow.<br>哇。</p><p>Yes, sir.<br>是的，先生。</p><p>As I think people can perhaps tell who are watching this, these questions are not prepared in advance.<br>我认为人们可以告诉那些正在观看的人，这些问题不是事先准备好的。</p><p>This is literally random questions from the crowd, which is cool.<br>这确实是来自人群的随机问题，这很酷。</p><p>I actually am fine with that.<br>我实际上对此很好。</p><p>And I think that it’s going to sound very straightforward.<br>我认为这听起来会非常简单。</p><p>But you want to really buy stock in companies where you think the products that that company makes will be better in the future.<br>但是你真的想购买那些你认为该公司制造的产品将来会更好的公司的股票。</p><p>Like is that company going to make more and better products?<br>就像该公司会制造更多更好的产品吗？</p><p>Or like do you love the products that that company makes and are they going to keep doing that?<br>或者你喜欢该公司制造的产品，他们会继续这样做吗？</p><p>And like I think Tesla, as I’ve just gone through, Tesla has a track record of having made many great products.<br>而且我认为特斯拉，就像我刚才经历的那样，特斯拉有制造许多伟大产品的记录。</p><p>And we’re going to make many more future great products and we’re going to scale up production.<br>我们将制造更多未来的伟大产品，我们将扩大生产。</p><p>And I think we’ve demonstrated a level of innovation that is extremely rare.<br>我认为我们已经展示了极其罕见的创新水平。</p><p>I mean, certainly by far the most innovative company in the car industry, like not even close type of thing.<br>我的意思是，当然是迄今为止汽车行业最具创新性的公司，根本没有可比性。</p><p>So, you know, I do think Tesla stock actually long I think long term with with Optimus and self driving Tesla will probably be the most valuable company in the world.<br>所以，你知道，我确实认为特斯拉股票实际上长期来看，我认为长期来看，随着擎天柱和自动驾驶，特斯拉可能会成为世界上最有价值的公司。</p><p>But there are also other companies out there that make great products and services.<br>但是也有其他公司制造出色的产品和服务。</p><p>So I think that’s the way you want to look at it.<br>所以我认为这就是你想看待它的方式。</p><p>Say like, do you think this product because that’s the reason why companies exist is to make great products and services.<br>说，你认为这个产品，因为这就是公司存在的原因是制造出色的产品和服务。</p><p>So if you think that the company is going to improve over time, then buy the stock and if you don’t, then don’t.<br>所以如果你认为公司会随着时间的推移而进步，那就购买股票，如果你不这么认为，那就不要购买。</p><p>And then the stock market is it’s a very strange thing.<br>然后股市是一个非常奇怪的东西。</p><p>It’s kind of like, you know, I think it was Warren Buffett sort of metaphor analogy is.<br>这有点像，你知道，我认为这是沃伦·巴菲特的一种隐喻类比。</p><p>You know, stock markets like having someone stand at the edge of your property or your house and yell prices to buy or sell your house every day.<br>你知道，股市就像有人每天站在你的财产或你房子的边缘，喊叫买卖你的房子的价格。</p><p>And like sometimes they take their meds and sometimes they don’t, you know.<br>就像有时他们吃药，有时他们不吃药，你知道。</p><p>So sometimes the person yelling the price of your house is having a good day or sometimes having a bad day.<br>所以有时喊叫你房子价格的人心情很好，有时心情不好。</p><p>But it’s still the same house.<br>但它仍然是同一栋房子。</p><p>You’re like, I’m like literally still the same house.<br>你会想，我实际上仍然是同一栋房子。</p><p>Like, you know, so Tesla stock goes up and it goes down.<br>就像，你知道，所以特斯拉股票上涨和下跌。</p><p>But actually it’s still the same company.<br>但实际上它仍然是同一家公司。</p><p>It’s just people’s perception of the future.<br>这只是人们对未来的看法。</p><p>I don’t know.<br>我不知道。</p><p>I guess it’s just very emotional, you know.<br>我猜这只是非常情绪化的，你知道。</p><p>So but for me, like while it’s difficult to predict how things will be from.<br>所以但对我来说，虽然很难预测事情会如何发展。</p><p>You know, in the next six to 12 months, if you say like where will things be in three years or five years, the future of Tesla is incredibly bright.<br>你知道，在接下来的六到十二个月里，如果你说三年或五年后会是什么样子，特斯拉的未来将非常光明。</p><p>Hello, Eli.<br>你好，埃莱。</p><p>I’m Hi.<br>我是嗨。</p><p>Yes.<br>是的。</p><p>You say will the robot take your job or what?<br>你说机器人会抢走你的工作吗？</p><p>That’s a fair question.<br>这是一个公平的问题。</p><p>So yeah, like is the robot going to come steal your job?<br>所以是的，机器人会来抢走你的工作吗？</p><p>A reasonable question.<br>一个合理的问题。</p><p>I think what we’ll find with the robots is that there will be a ratio of people to robots.<br>我认为我们将会发现，机器人会与人形成一种比例。</p><p>So you’ll effectively end up having managing a group of robots.<br>所以你最终会有效地管理一组机器人。</p><p>So you know, you’ll have like basically, I don’t know, your flock or your little group of robots that you take care of and you tell them what to do.<br>所以你知道，你会像基本上，我不知道，你的羊群或你的小群机器人，你照顾它们并告诉它们做什么。</p><p>And I don’t know, you’ll have a pack of robots basically.<br>而且我不知道，你基本上会有一群机器人。</p><p>Yeah, you’re promoted to manager.<br>是的，你被提升为经理。</p><p>One way to think of it.<br>一种思考方式。</p><p>I think the same thing will be true of cars.<br>我认为汽车也会如此。</p><p>Like for the self-driving cars is that people that are say Uber drivers today or something like that or taxi drivers today will end up managing a fleet of cars.<br>就像对于自动驾驶汽车来说，比如今天优步司机或者出租车司机之类的人最终会管理一支车队。</p><p>And that will be a much more effective use of their time.<br>这将更加有效地利用他们的时间。</p><p>You know, just taking care of like 10, 20 cars or however many they can take care of.<br>你知道，只是照顾像10辆，20辆汽车或他们能照顾的任何数量的汽车。</p><p>So yeah.<br>所以是的。</p><p>Hello, my name is Adrian.<br>你好，我叫阿德里安。</p><p>You said that your companies are made to make products people love.<br>你说你的公司是为了制造人们喜爱的产品而设立的。</p><p>Yeah.<br>是的。</p><p>Have you ever thought of airplanes or trains?<br>你有没有想过飞机或火车？</p><p>Yeah, I mean, I’d actually love to make airplanes especially, but I’m stretched pretty thin.<br>是的，我的意思是，我实际上很想制造飞机，但我已经分身乏术了。</p><p>So I have like 17 jobs.<br>所以我身兼17职。</p><p>At this point I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, and then do that seven days a week pretty much.<br>在这一点上，我只是睡觉，工作，睡觉，然后每周七天都这样做。</p><p>People say like where do you go on vacation?<br>人们会说，比如你去哪里度假？</p><p>I’m like what’s that?<br>我就像那是什么？</p><p>You know.<br>你知道。</p><p>But I guess I like being productive.<br>但我猜我喜欢有生产力。</p><p>I like getting things done.<br>我喜欢把事情做完。</p><p>So I guess I could choose to be like on an island somewhere, sipping a Mai Tai, you know, with attractive people in bikinis and stuff.<br>所以我猜我可以选择在某个岛屿上，啜饮一杯Mai Tai，你知道，和穿着比基尼的有魅力的人在一起。</p><p>Wait, why am I not doing that?<br>等等，我为什么不这样做？</p><p>What?<br>什么？</p><p>What a fool I’ve been.<br>我真是个傻瓜。</p><p>So yeah.<br>所以是的。</p><p>I’ve actually thought about aircraft designs for a long time.<br>实际上我已经考虑飞机设计很长时间了。</p><p>And I think there’s an interesting opportunity to make like an electric supersonic VTOL jet.<br>我认为有一个有趣的机会来制造像电动超音速VTOL喷气机。</p><p>You know, the VTOL is like cherry on the cake, but certainly electric, long range fast electric airplane would be very cool.<br>你知道，VTOL就像锦上添花，但当然电动，远程快速电动飞机会非常酷。</p><p>You know, maybe at some point we’ll do that.<br>你知道，也许在某个时候我们会这样做。</p><p>Yeah, that would be kind of fun.<br>是的，这会很有趣。</p><p>But we do have the ingredients for it.<br>但我们确实拥有制造它的要素。</p><p>So.<br>所以。</p><p>And then there is the potential for, yeah, we’re like thinking like pretty far into the future here of not a conventional train, but that sort of hyperloop.<br>然后有潜力，是的，我们正在考虑非常遥远的未来，不是传统的火车，而是那种超级高铁。</p><p>Essentially vacuum tunnels, like tunnels where you draw a vacuum so there’s no air resistance.<br>基本上是真空隧道，就像你在隧道里抽真空一样，这样就没有空气阻力。</p><p>And you have very high speed, autonomous electric pods in a vacuum tube, vacuum tunnel.<br>而且你在真空管，真空隧道里有非常高速，自主的电动舱。</p><p>That would allow you to go from city center to city center much faster than any airplane could possibly go.<br>这将使你从市中心到市中心的速度比任何飞机都快得多。</p><p>Because going into the into the underground vacuum tunnel would be like teleporting to super high altitude effectively, which no plane could do.<br>因为进入地下真空隧道就像有效地传送到超高海拔，这是任何飞机都做不到的。</p><p>And then it could deliver you right to the center of a city.<br>然后它可以将你送到一个城市的中心。</p><p>And that I don’t know, maybe that’s some future collaboration with the Boeing company and Tesla.<br>而且我不知道，也许这是未来与波音公司和特斯拉的合作。</p><p>I got a million ideas.<br>我有一百万个想法。</p><p>The ideas are I have more ideas than I know what to do with.<br>我的想法比我知道如何处理的还要多。</p><p>Ideas are kind of the easy part.<br>想法是比较容易的部分。</p><p>Execution is the hard part.<br>执行是困难的部分。</p><p>As they say, it’s one percent inspiration, 99 percent post-proporation.<br>正如他们所说，这是百分之一的灵感，百分之九十九的事后努力。</p><p>Work in manufacturing engineering.<br>从事制造工程工作。</p><p>Since 2018, I’ve done a bunch of different things here, kind of like energy products, Model 3, Model Y, cyber.<br>自2018年以来，我在这里做了很多不同的事情，有点像能源产品，Model 3，Model Y，cyber。</p><p>And now we’re looking forward to Optimus, maybe the biggest product ever.<br>现在我们期待着擎天柱，也许是有史以来最大的产品。</p><p>Yeah, it will be.<br>是的，会的。</p><p>And I think about the mission statement of the company and its evolved.<br>我想到了公司的使命宣言及其演变。</p><p>It used to be a sustainable transportation, then sustainable energy.<br>它曾经是可持续交通，然后是可持续能源。</p><p>Is it going to evolve again?<br>它会再次发展吗？</p><p>Are we going to reformulate that officially to kind of explain to the world better about how Optimus and AI folds into the rest of the fabric of the company?<br>我们将正式重新制定它，以更好地向世界解释擎天柱和人工智能如何融入公司的其他结构中吗？</p><p>Yeah, I mean, I touched on this briefly earlier, but you’re right that I think we do need to articulate it more prominently.<br>是的，我的意思是，我之前简要地提到了这一点，但你是对的，我认为我们确实需要更突出地表达它。</p><p>And maybe more often because it’s really about sustainable abundance.<br>也许更频繁地表达它，因为它实际上是关于可持续的丰盈。</p><p>Can we have a future of abundance for all that is also sustainable and compatible with nature?<br>我们能拥有一个为所有人带来丰盈的未来，同时又是可持续的并且与自然兼容吗？</p><p>So we’re not destroying nature, but you also get abundance for everyone on Earth.<br>所以我们没有破坏自然，但你也为地球上的每个人获得了丰盈。</p><p>Sounds like the best possible future.<br>听起来是最好的未来。</p><p>That’s what we’re trying to do.<br>这就是我们试图做的。</p><p>Yeah.<br>是的。</p><p>Yes, sir, my name is Aaron Armstrong.<br>是的，先生，我叫艾伦·阿姆斯特朗。</p><p>Yes, sir, my name is Aaron Armstrong.<br>是的，先生，我叫艾伦·阿姆斯特朗。</p><p>It’s not every day that you get to be in the presence of somebody that’s accumulated so much wealth and success.<br>你不是每天都有机会与积累了如此多财富和成功的人在一起。</p><p>So I just wanted to take this opportunity to ask for any wisdoms or secrets that you may have to offer about this game of life that we’re all trying to play.<br>所以我想借此机会询问你可能拥有的关于我们都在试图玩的游戏人生的任何智慧或秘密。</p><p>Sure.<br>当然。</p><p>I mean, I try to say everything that I know.<br>我的意思是，我尽量说出我所知道的一切。</p><p>Well, admittedly, sometimes I’m, you know, like I posted on X.<br>嗯，不得不承认，有时我是，你知道，就像我在X上发布的。</p><p>I guess I should ask the AI to look through all of my X posts and pick out the ones that are really good because I try to say any good ideas that I have.<br>我想我应该要求人工智能查看我所有的X帖子，并挑选出真正好的帖子，因为我尽量说出我拥有的任何好主意。</p><p>I try to post them.<br>我尽量发布它们。</p><p>Yeah, I think generally it’s good to always be curious and to, you know, to read

interesting.<br>我发现历史真的很有趣。</p><p>And I find like biographies and autobiographies to be also very interesting.<br>我发现像传记和自传也很有趣。</p><p>You know, I think it’s good to read especially autobiographies where like, you know, somebody’s done something incredible and they wrote the book themselves or mostly themselves.<br>你知道，我认为阅读自传尤其有好处，因为，你知道，有人做了一些令人难以置信的事情，他们自己或大部分时间自己写了这本书。</p><p>That’ll give you a lot of ideas.<br>那会给你很多想法。</p><p>And I mean, something that I do is I’ll get audio books because I got like so much going on in my mind when it’s kind of hard to go to sleep.<br>我的意思是，我做的一件事是我会买有声读物，因为我的脑子里有很多事情，很难入睡。</p><p>Because it’s like having a computer browser with like 100 tabs open.<br>因为它就像有一个打开了100个标签的计算机浏览器。</p><p>By the end of the day, I got like 100 tabs open.<br>到一天结束时，我就像打开了100个标签。</p><p>It’s like I got to close this browser, you know.<br>就像我必须关闭这个浏览器，你知道。</p><p>That’s my brain.<br>那是我的大脑。</p><p>So then I’ll listen to an audio book and I’ll put

Starbase.<br>哦，南德克萨斯州有一座城市，叫做星舰基地。</p><p>So it’s a city for, it’s, cities maybe makes it sound bigger than it is.<br>所以这是一座城市，城市这个词可能使它听起来比实际更大。</p><p>But it is, it’s a really a small town plus a giant rocket factory.<br>但它确实是，它实际上是一个小镇加上一个巨大的火箭工厂。</p><p>That’s Starbase.<br>那是星舰基地。</p><p>And it’s South Texas and Starbase, Texas, right by the Rio

question.<br>嗯，如果你之前没有问过问题，你可以问一个问题。</p><p>Well, there are actually some autonomous robots being built in Fremont right now.<br>嗯，现在实际上在弗里蒙特正在建造一些自主机器人。</p><p>So, I’m not sure what that

sustainability.<br>这是关于可持续性的。</p><p>Abundance, yes.<br>丰盈，是的。</p><p>Well, yes.<br>嗯，是的。</p><p>I mean, obviously, utopia could be dystopia.<br>我的意思是，显然，乌托邦可能是反乌托邦。</p><p>So we have to, like usually any story about utopia ends up being dystopia.<br>所以我们必须，就像通常任何关于乌托邦的故事最终都会变成反乌托邦。</p><p>We want to avoid that.<br>我们想避免这种情况。</p><p>But nonetheless, I think if you say what future, what’s the best future you can think of?<br>但尽管如此，我认为如果你说什么样的未来，你能想到的最好的未来是什么？</p><p>I think a future of sustainable abundance plus space travel, that’s pretty great.<br>我认为一个可持续丰盈加上太空旅行的未来，那非常棒。</p><p>Yeah.<br>是的。</p><p>Oh, we need adversity.<br>哦，我们需要逆境。</p><p>Well, I mean, you make a good point.<br>嗯，我的意思是，你说得对。</p><p>Like if things actually get too easy, maybe we get bored and we’re not, you kind of want to, to some degree, overcome adversity.<br>就像如果事情实际上变得太容易，也许我们会感到无聊，我们不，你在某种程度上想克服逆境。</p><p>You know, it’s like if you play a game of some kind, you want the game to be not too easy and not too hard.<br>你知道，就像如果你玩某种游戏，你希望游戏不要太容易，也不要太难。</p><p>And maybe the future will be too easy, potentially, is what you’re saying.<br>也许未来会太容易，你可能想说的是。</p><p>Yeah, it’s a high-class problem, you know.<br>是的，这是一个高阶问题，你知道。</p><p>But I think we’ll still have human-to-human competitions.<br>但我认为我们仍然会有人与人之间的竞争。</p><p>I mean, if you look at, say, athletics or even mind games like chess, although computers can beat any human at chess, chess is actually at an all-time high in popularity.<br>我的意思是，如果你看看，比如说，田径运动，甚至是像国际象棋这样的智力游戏，尽管计算机可以在国际象棋方面击败任何人，但国际象棋实际上正处于有史以来最高的受欢迎程度。</p><p>And although, you know, cars can go faster than any humans, we still have athletic sports where humans compete against each other.<br>尽管，你知道，汽车可以比任何人跑得更快，我们仍然有体育运动，人类互相竞争。</p><p>So I think we’ll still have human versus human competitiveness.<br>所以我认为我们仍然会有人与人之间的竞争。</p><p>I think long-term we’ll also have enhancement of humans or optionally if somebody wants to enhance, like have like cybernetic enhancements like with Neuralink.<br>我认为长期来看，我们也会有对人类的增强，或者如果有人想增强，比如像Neuralink那样的控制论增强。</p><p>You know, if you want to go cybernetic and, I don’t know, maybe have like superintelligence and be able to see.<br>你知道，如果你想变成控制论，而且，我不知道，也许拥有超级智能并且能够看到。</p><p>You know, in different wavelengths, we could absolutely provide superhuman abilities via Neuralink in the future.<br>你知道，在不同的波长中，我们将来绝对可以通过Neuralink提供超人的能力。</p><p>So one thing’s for sure, the future is going to be very interesting.<br>所以有一件事是肯定的，未来将会非常有趣。</p><p>In fact, I think the most, generally I find that the most interesting outcome is the most likely.<br>事实上，我认为最，通常我发现最有趣的结果是最有可能的结果。</p><p>Or to say it another way, maybe the most entertaining outcome, especially if ironic, is the most likely.<br>或者换句话说，也许最有趣的结果，尤其是如果具有讽刺意味，是最有可能的结果。</p><p>It’s almost like we’re in an alien Netflix series that’s trying to have the highest possible ratings.<br>这几乎就像我们正在观看一个外星Netflix系列剧，该系列剧试图获得尽可能高的收视率。</p><p>And like if you think about it, like that’s kind of what happens, you know, which it doesn’t mean it’s always good.<br>就像如果你想想，就像这就是发生的事情，你知道，但这并不意味着它总是好的。</p><p>Because to your point, you wouldn’t really want to watch a show where things are great and stay great.<br>因为正如你所说，你并不真的想观看一个事物美好并且保持美好的节目。</p><p>I’m like, oh, that’s boring.<br>我会想，哦，那很无聊。</p><p>You want to watch a show where there’s like a narrative arc where things go up and they go down, they go back up again.<br>你想观看一个节目，其中有一个叙事弧，事物上升，然后下降，然后再次上升。</p><p>And you don’t know exactly what’s going to happen next.<br>你不知道接下来会发生什么。</p><p>And I think we might be in an alien Netflix series here.<br>我认为我们可能正在观看一个外星Netflix系列剧。</p><p>So we’re just going to keep the ratings up so we don’t get canceled.<br>所以我们将保持收视率，这样我们就不会被取消。</p><p>All right.<br>好的。</p><p>Thank you, guys.<br>谢谢你们，伙计们。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p><p>Thank you.<br>谢谢。</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Pippa.</p><p>Georgie<br>And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?</p><p>Pippa<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?</p><p>Georgie<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.</p><p>Pippa<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650</p><p>Georgie<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.</p><p>Georgie<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.</p><p>Pippa<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.</p><p>Pippa<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.</p><p>Amy, mentor<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]</p><p>Ally<br>Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.</p><p>Georgia<br>I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.</p><p>Ally<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.</p><p>Georgie<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.</p><p>Pippa<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.</p><p>Georgie<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!</p><p>Pippa<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.</p><p>Georgie<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.</p><p>Georgie<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.</p><p>Georgie<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.</p><p>Pippa<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.</p><p>Georgie<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.</p><p>Pippa<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!</p><p>Georgie<br>Oh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up.

In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?<br>我是 Georgie。在这个计划中，我们谈论的是节省食物费用。Pippa，你擅长在食品店省钱吗？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?<br>我觉得我挺好的。我计划我喜欢做什么，这样我就不会在超市浪费钱。你呢，Georgie？</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.<br>我不是很好。我通常在饿的时候去超市，所以我最终买了很多零食。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650<br>哦，这真是个糟糕的主意。好吧，在这个计划中，我们将学习一种在我们吃的食物上省钱的方法。但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Georgie。世界上最昂贵的餐厅被认为是伊维萨岛一家名为 Sublimotion 的餐厅，每晚只有 12 名顾客。但是，在餐厅每人吃一顿饭要多少欧元呢？a） 650 欧元 b） 1,650 欧元 c） 2,650 欧元</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.<br>最昂贵的…我选择 c） 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，英国的食品越来越贵，就像在世界许多地方一样，有些人正在努力负担食品购物的费用。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.<br>但 BBC 世界服务节目 People Fixing the World 一直在了解一个名为“Bags of Taste”的项目，该项目帮助人们节省购买食品的费用，同时改善他们的饮食。Bags of something 是一种非正式的方式，可以表达很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.<br>Bags of Taste 的创始人 Alicia Weston 开始担心，在英国，钱少的人发现很难负担得起健康的饮食。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.<br>贫困人口的饮食习惯最差，而且他们的年龄越来越大。我们知道，饮食是英国健康不平等的最大原因。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.<br>Alicia 发现人们不知道如何烹饪他们想吃的饭菜，而且他们负担不起实验的费用。想象一下，在食材上花了很多钱，然后通过煮得不好或烧焦食物来浪费它们。人们还认为制作健康食品太昂贵且花费太多时间。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.<br>因此，最终，我们能够提出一个基本上可以解决所有这些问题的计划。所以我们现在做的是将所有原料送到他们家门口，因为归根结底，行为改变始于真正改变你在家里的行为。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.<br>Alicia 说，最终，她已经能够想出一个解决方案来帮助人们在健康食品上省钱。我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally，在一系列事件发生之后。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.<br>Alicia 希望解决阻碍人们在预算内吃健康食品的问题。如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它。Alicia 的解决方案包括将食材和食谱交付给人们，然后使用 WhatsApp 群组与参与者交谈。每个 WhatsApp 群组都有一位导师，他会分享烹饪技巧和建议。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.<br>为了让您了解其运作方式，People Fixing the World 的团队在其中一个 “Bags of Taste” WhatsApp 聊天中朗读了一些消息。</p><p>Amy, mentor(Amy，导师)<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]<br>记得把冰箱袋放在冰箱里。我们能不能在星期二晚上之前做一个食谱？我们的第一个食谱 chana masala 是经典之作。它需要一个洋葱，切碎可能会很痛苦。所以，试试我们的方式。[视频发布]</p><p>Ally(盟友)<br>Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.<br>喜欢这种方法 [厨师表情符号]。我第一次切这样的洋葱，它是如此整洁和简单。</p><p>Georgia(格鲁吉亚)<br>I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.<br>我明天要煮我的。期待它。</p><p>Ally(盟友)<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.<br>我已经完成了我的 chana masala。我对辣椒有点太重了。我丈夫喜欢很多香料。所以，下次我会减少这个数字。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.<br>该小组的导师 Amy 将 chana masala 的食谱描述为经典之作。我们称某物为经典，以表示它是众所周知的且质量好。我们也可以将特定的书籍、电影或歌曲描述为经典。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.<br>Amy 发送了一段视频，展示了一种切洋葱的技术，她将其描述为切洋葱很痛苦。如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那就很难做或令人讨厌。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!<br>其中一位参与者 Ally 说，当她制作 chana masala 时，她对辣椒有点粗暴。如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多，所以 Ally 的 chana masala 非常辣！</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.<br>Bags of Taste 帮助人们学习新食谱并烹饪健康食品，而无需花太多钱。在我的问题中，这肯定比在餐厅吃饭便宜得多，Georgie。我问你，在被认为是世界上最昂贵的餐厅 Sublimotion 吃一顿饭要多少钱。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.<br>是的，我说一顿饭是 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.<br>好吧，你错了。它实际上是 1,650 欧元，但我认为这仍然相当昂贵。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.<br>绝对是。还行。让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 bags of 开始，这意味着很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.<br>我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally， after a series of events。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.<br>如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它并找到解决方案。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.<br>如果我们将某样东西（比如食谱）描述为经典，我们的意思是它是众所周知的并且质量好。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.<br>如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那么它就是烦人或难以做到的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!<br>如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多。例如，前几天我做了一些汤，盐有点重 —— 味道很恶心！</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Oh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website.

Hard to even compare, and the reason for that is because of artificial intelligence.<br>它的散熱能效提高了 30%，性能令人難以置信。甚至難以比較，而原因就在於人工智能。</p><p>GeForce brought CUDA to the world. CUDA enabled AI, and AI has now come back to revolutionize computer graphics.<br>GeForce 將 CUDA 帶給了世界。CUDA 賦能了 AI，而 AI 現在又回來徹底改變計算機圖形學。</p><p>What you’re looking at is real-time computer graphics, 100% path traced. For every pixel that’s rendered, artificial intelligence predicts the other 15.<br>你現在看到的是實時計算機圖形，100% 路徑追蹤。對於渲染的每一個像素，人工智能會預測其餘的 15 個像素。</p><p>AI really came into the world’s consciousness about a decade ago. Started with perception AI, computer vision, speech recognition.<br>大約十年前，AI 才真正進入了世界的視野。它始於感知 AI、計算機視覺、語音識別。</p><p>Then generative AI. Generative AI fundamentally changed how computing is done. From a retrieval computing model, we now have a generative computing model.<br>接着是生成式 AI。生成式 AI 從根本上改變了計算的完成方式。從檢索式計算模型，我們現在擁有了生成式計算模型。</p><p>Now, AI understands the context, understands what we’re asking, understands the meaning of our request, and generates what it knows.<br>現在，AI 能夠理解上下文，理解我們的提問，理解我們請求的含義，並生成它所知道的內容。</p><p>The last couple of two, three years, major breakthrough happened. Fundamental advance in artificial intelligence. We call it agentic AI.<br>在過去的兩三年裏，發生了重大的突破。人工智能取得了根本性的進展。我們稱之爲智能體 AI。</p><p>Agentic AI basically means that you have an AI that has agency. It can perceive and understand the context of the circumstance.<br>智能體 AI 基本上意味着你擁有一個具有自主性的 AI。它可以感知並理解環境的背景。</p><p>It can reason, very importantly, can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem. And it can plan an action.<br>它可以推理，非常重要的是，能夠推理如何回答或如何解決問題。並且它可以規劃行動。</p><p>At the foundation of agentic AI, of course, something that’s very new, reasoning. And then, of course, the next wave is already happening.<br>當然，智能體 AI 的基礎是一些非常新的東西，比如推理能力。然後，下一波浪潮顯然已經在發生。</p><p>We’re going to talk a lot about that today. Robotics, which has been enabled by physical AI. AI that understands the physical world.<br>我們今天會重點討論這個。機器人技術，它已由物理 AI 實現。即理解物理世界的 AI。</p><p>It understands things like friction and inertia, cause and effect, object permanence.<br>它能理解像摩擦力、慣性、因果關係、物體恆存性這樣的事物。</p><p>When someone doesn’t mean to disappear from this universe, it’s still there. Just not seeable.<br>當某物並非有意從這個宇宙消失時，它仍然存在，只是看不見而已。</p><p>And so that ability to understand the physical world, the three-dimensional world.<br>因此，這種理解物理世界、三維世界的能力。</p><p>Is what’s going to enable a new era of AI we call physical AI, and it’s going to enable robotics.<br>將會開啓一個我們稱爲物理 AI 的新紀元，並將賦能機器人技術。</p><p>The computation requirement, the scaling law of AI is more resilient, and in fact, hyper accelerated.<br>AI 的計算需求和擴展定律更具彈性，並且實際上是超級加速的。</p><p>The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning.<br>由於智能體 AI 和推理能力的發展，我們現階段所需的計算量。</p><p>Is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year.<br>輕易就達到了我們去年此時認爲所需計算量的一百倍。</p><p>In training, there are two fundamental problems we have to solve. Where does the data come from? Where does the data come from?<br>在訓練方面，我們必須解決兩個根本問題。數據從哪裏來？數據從哪裏來？</p><p>And how do we not have it be limited by human in the loop? There’s only so much data and so much human demonstration we can perform.<br>以及我們如何才能不被“人類在環”所限制？我們能執行的數據量和人類演示是有限的。</p><p>And so this is the big breakthrough in the last couple years. Reinforcement learning, verifiable results.<br>這就是過去幾年的重大突破。強化學習，可驗證的結果。</p><p>So you can kind of see that in fact, AI is going through an inflection point. It has become more useful because it’s smarter, it can reason.<br>所以你可以看到，事實上，AI 正在經歷一個轉折點。它變得更加有用，因爲它更智能，能夠推理。</p><p>It is more used, you can tell it’s more used, because whenever you go to chat GPT these days, it seems like you have to wait longer and longer and longer, which is a good thing.<br>它被使用得更頻繁了，你可以看出來它被用得更多了，因爲現在每當你去用 ChatGPT 時，似乎等待的時間越來越長，這是件好事。</p><p>It says a lot of people are using it with great effect. And the amount of computation necessary to train those models and to inference those models has grown tremendously.<br>這說明很多人正在有效地使用它。而訓練這些模型和進行模型推理所需的計算量已經急劇增長。</p><p>So in just one year, and Blackwell has just started shipping, in just one year, you could see the incredible growth in AI infrastructure.<br>因此，僅僅一年時間，而且 Blackwell 纔剛剛開始出貨，僅僅一年，你就能看到 AI 基礎設施令人難以置信的增長。</p><p>I’ve said before that I expect data center build out to reach a trillion dollars. And I am fairly certain we’re going to reach that very soon.<br>我之前說過，我預計數據中心的建設規模將達到一萬億美元。而且我相當確定我們很快就會達到這個目標。</p><p>And the world is going through a platform shift from hand coded software running on general purpose computers to machine learning software running on accelerators and GPUs.<br>世界正在經歷一場平臺轉變，從在通用計算機上運行的手動編碼軟件，轉向在加速器和 GPU 上運行的機器學習軟件。</p><p>This way of doing computation is at this point past this tipping point.<br>這種計算方式目前已經越過了臨界點。</p><p>And we are now seeing the inflection point happening, the inflection happening in the world’s data center build outs.<br>我們現在正看到轉折點的發生，這個轉折點正發生在世界數據中心的建設中。</p><p>So the first thing is a transition in the way we do computing. Second is an increase in recognition that the future of software requires capital investment.<br>所以，首先是計算方式的轉變。其次是人們越來越認識到軟件的未來需要資本投入。</p><p>Now this is a very big idea. Whereas in the past we wrote the software and we ran it on computers, in the future the computer is going to generate the tokens for the software.<br>這是一個非常重要的理念。過去我們編寫軟件並在計算機上運行，未來計算機將爲軟件生成 Token。</p><p>And so the computer has become a generator of tokens, not a retrieval of files.<br>因此，計算機已經變成了 Token 的生成器，而不是文件的檢索器。</p><p>From retrieval based computing to generative based computing, from the old way of doing data centers to a new way of building these infrastructure, and I call them AI factories.<br>從基於檢索的計算到基於生成的計算，從舊的數據中心運作方式到建設這些基礎設施的新方式，我稱之爲 AI 工廠。</p><p>They’re AI factories because it has one job and one job only, generating these incredible tokens.<br>它們是 AI 工廠，因爲它們只有一個任務，且僅此一個任務，那就是生成這些令人難以置信的 Token。</p><p>So the world is going through a transition in not just the amount of data centers that will be built, but also how it’s built.<br>所以世界正在經歷的轉變，不僅僅在於將要建設的數據中心的數量，還在於它們的建設方式。</p><p>Well everything in the data center will be accelerated, not all of its AI. This is in fact what GTC is all about.<br>嗯，數據中心裏的所有東西都將被加速，但並非所有都是 AI。這實際上就是 GTC 的全部意義所在。</p><p>You need all kinds of libraries and frameworks. We call them CUDA-X libraries, acceleration frameworks for each one of these fields of science.<br>你需要各種各樣的庫和框架。我們稱之爲 CUDA-X 庫，它們是針對各個科學領域的加速框架。</p><p>But you know AI started in the cloud. It started in the cloud for good reason because it turns out that AI needs infrastructure.<br>但你知道，AI 是在雲端起步的。它在雲端起步是有充分理由的，因爲事實證明 AI 需要基礎設施。</p><p>It’s machine learning. If the science is machine learning then you need a machine to do the science.<br>它是機器學習。如果這門科學是機器學習，那麼你就需要一臺機器來做這門科學。</p><p>And so machine learning requires infrastructure and the cloud data centers have infrastructure.<br>因此，機器學習需要基礎設施，而云數據中心擁有基礎設施。</p><p>They also have extraordinary computer science, extraordinary research, the perfect circumstance for AI to take off in the cloud and the CSPs.<br>它們還擁有非凡的計算機科學、非凡的研究，這是 AI 在雲端和雲服務提供商中騰飛的完美環境。</p><p>But that’s not where AI is limited to. AI will go everywhere. And we’re going to talk about AI in a lot of different ways.<br>但 AI 並不僅限於此。AI 將無處不在。我們將以多種不同的方式討論 AI。</p><p>And the cloud service providers of course they like our leading edge technology.<br>當然，雲服務提供商喜歡我們領先的技術。</p><p>They like the fact that we have full stack because accelerated computing as you know, as I was explaining earlier, is not about the chip.<br>他們喜歡我們擁有全棧能力，因爲正如你所知，正如我之前解釋的，加速計算不僅僅是關於芯片。</p><p>It’s not even just the chip in the library. The programming model is the chip, the programming model, and a whole bunch of software that goes on top of it.<br>它甚至不只是芯片和庫。編程模型就是芯片、編程模型，以及在其之上運行的大量軟件。</p><p>That entire stack is incredibly complex. There’s a whole bunch of companies, maybe 20 of them, who started during the NVIDIA time.<br>整個技術棧極其複雜。有一大批公司，大約 20 家，是在英偉達時代起步的。</p><p>And what they do is just one thing. They host GPUs. They call themselves GPU clouds. All right, let’s talk about data centers.<br>他們只做一件事。他們託管 GPU。他們稱自己爲 GPU 雲。好了，我們來談談數據中心。</p><p>Blackwell is in full production and this is what it looks like. It’s an incredible, incredible, you know, for people, for us, this is a sight of beauty.<br>Blackwell 已經全面投產，這就是它的樣子。你知道，對於人們，對於我們來說，這是一種令人難以置信、難以置信的美景。</p><p>Would you agree? This is. Blackwell is way, way better than Hopper. And remember, this is not ISO chips. This is ISO power.<br>你同意嗎？就是這樣。Blackwell 比 Hopper 好太多太多了。請記住，這不是同等芯片比較，這是同等功耗比較。</p><p>And in a reasoning model, Blackwell is 40 times, 40 times the performance of Hopper. Straight up.<br>在推理模型中，Blackwell 的性能是 Hopper 的 40 倍，整整 40 倍。毫不含糊。</p><p>Okay, just to put it in perspective, this is what a 100 megawatt factory looks like. This is a 100 megawatt factory.<br>好的，爲了讓大家有個概念，這就是一個 100 兆瓦工廠的樣子。這是一個 100 兆瓦的工廠。</p><p>You have, based on Hopper’s, you have 45,000 dies, 1400 racks, and it produces 300 million tokens per second. Okay?<br>基於 Hopper 的話，你有 45,000 個裸片，1400 個機架，它每秒產生 3 億個 Token。明白嗎？</p><p>And then this is what it looks like with Blackwell. We’re now in full production of Blackwell.<br>然後，這就是使用 Blackwell 的樣子。我們現在已經全面投產 Blackwell。</p><p>And now, in the second half of this year, we’ll easily transition into the upgrade. So we have the Blackwell Ultra, NVLink 72.<br>現在，在今年下半年，我們將輕鬆過渡到升級版。所以我們有了 Blackwell Ultra，NVLink 72。</p><p>You know, it’s one and a half times more flops. It’s, you know, it’s got a new instruction for attention. It’s one and a half times more memory.<br>你知道，它的浮點運算性能提高了一倍半。它，嗯，它有了一個新的用於注意力機制的指令。它的內存增加了一倍半。</p><p>All that memory is useful for things like KVCache. It’s, you know, two times more bandwidth, okay, for networking bandwidth.<br>所有的內存對於像 KVCache 這樣的東西都很有用。它的帶寬，網絡帶寬，你知道，增加了一倍，好嗎。</p><p>And so you’re going to, now that we have the same architecture, we’ll just kind of gracefully glide into that. And that’s called Blackwell Ultra.<br>所以，既然我們擁有相同的架構，我們將順利地過渡到那個階段。那就是所謂的 Blackwell Ultra。</p><p>Okay? So that’s coming second half of this year. The next click, one year out, is named after an astronomer. And her grandkids are here.<br>好嗎？所以那將在今年下半年到來。下一次迭代，一年之後，是以一位天文學家的名字命名的。她的孫輩們今天也在場。</p><p>Her name is Vera Rubin. She discovered dark matter. Vera Rubin is incredible because the CPU is new.<br>她的名字是維拉·魯賓。她發現了暗物質。Vera Rubin 平臺令人難以置信，因爲 CPU 是全新的。</p><p>It’s twice the performance of Grace, more memory, more bandwidth, and yet just a little tiny 50-watt CPU is really quite incredible.<br>它的性能是 Grace 的兩倍，擁有更多內存、更大帶寬，然而僅僅是一個小小的 50 瓦 CPU，這真是相當不可思議。</p><p>Okay? And Rubin, brand new GPU. CX9, brand new networking SmartNIC. NVLink 6, brand new NVLink. Brand new memories, HBM4.<br>好嗎？還有 Rubin，全新的 GPU。CX9，全新的網絡智能網卡。NVLink 6，全新的 NVLink。全新的內存，HBM4。</p><p>Basically, everything is brand new. Except for the chassis. And so Vera Rubin, NVLink 144, is the second half of next year.<br>基本上，除了機箱，一切都是全新的。所以 Vera Rubin，NVLink 144，將在明年下半年推出。</p><p>And then this now sets the stage for the second half of the year, the following year, we call Rubin Ultra. NVLink 576, extreme scale-up.<br>然後，這爲後年下半年奠定了基礎，我們稱之爲 Rubin Ultra。NVLink 576，極致擴展。</p><p>Each rack is 600 kilowatts. Two and a half million parts. Okay? And, obviously, a whole lot of GPUs. And everything is X-factor more.<br>每個機架 600 千瓦。兩百五十萬個部件。好嗎？而且，顯然，有大量的 GPU。所有指標都呈 X 倍數增長。</p><p>So 14 times more, more flops, 15 exaflops. Instead of one exaflop, as I mentioned earlier, it’s now 15 exaflops scaled up exaflops.<br>所以是 14 倍以上，更多的浮點運算能力，15 Exaflops。相比我之前提到的 1 Exaflop，現在是 15 Exaflops 的擴展浮點運算能力。</p><p>Okay? And it’s 300, what? 4.6 petabytes, so 4,600 terabytes per second scale-up bandwidth. I don’t mean aggregate. I mean scale-up bandwidth.<br>好嗎？它是 300，什麼？4.6 Petabytes，也就是每秒 4600 Terabytes 的擴展帶寬。我不是指聚合帶寬，我說的是擴展帶寬。</p><p>And, of course, lots of brand new NVLink switch and CX9. Okay? So this is what Grace Blackwell looks like. And this is what Rubin looks like.<br>當然，還有大量全新的 NVLink 交換機和 CX9。好嗎？所以這就是 Grace Blackwell 的樣子。這就是 Rubin 的樣子。</p><p>Now that gives you a sense of the pace at which we’re moving. This is the amount of scale-up flops. This is scale-up flops.<br>現在這讓你瞭解了我們前進的速度。這是擴展浮點運算能力的量級。這是擴展浮點運算能力。</p><p>Hopper is 1x, Blackwell is 68x, Rubin is 900x. Okay? So that’s very quickly Nvidia’s roadmap. Our InfiniBand switch, the silicon is working fantastically.<br>Hopper 是 1 倍，Blackwell 是 68 倍，Rubin 是 900 倍。好嗎？這就是英偉達的路線圖概覽。我們的 InfiniBand 交換機，其芯片運行得非常出色。</p><p>Second half of this year we will ship the silicon photonic switch in the second half of this year.<br>今年下半年，我們將在今年下半年出貨硅光子交換機。</p><p>And the second half of next year we’ll ship the Spectrum X. Because of the MRM choice, because of the incredible technology risks that over the last five years.<br>明年下半年，我們將出貨 Spectrum X。由於 MRM 的選擇，由於過去五年中我們承擔的巨大技術風險。</p><p>That we did and filed hundreds of patents and we’ve licensed it to our partners so that we can all build them.<br>我們這樣做了，申請了數百項專利，並將其授權給我們的合作伙伴，以便我們大家都能製造它們。</p><p>Now we’re in a position to put silicon photonics with co-package options, no transceivers, fiber, direct fiber in into our switches with a radix of 512.<br>現在我們能夠將硅光子技術與共封裝選項相結合，無需收發器，使用光纖，將直接光纖引入到我們具有 512 基數的交換機中。</p><p>This is the 512 ports. This would just simply not be possible any other way.<br>這就是 512 個端口。用其他任何方式都根本不可能實現。</p><p>And so this is, this now set us up to be able to scale up to these multi-hundred thousand GPUs and multi-million GPUs.<br>因此，這，這現在使我們能夠擴展到數十萬乃至數百萬 GPU 的規模。</p><p>Let me talk to you about enterprise computing. This is the computer of the age of AI. Okay?<br>讓我和大家談談企業計算。這是 AI 時代的計算機。好嗎？</p><p>So this is called DGX station. DGX Spark and DGX station are going to be available by all of the OEMs. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus.<br>這個叫做 DGX Station。DGX Spark 和 DGX Station 將通過所有的 OEM 廠商提供。惠普、戴爾、聯想、華碩。</p><p>It’s going to be manufactured for data scientists and researchers all over the world. This is what computers should look like.<br>它將爲全世界的數據科學家和研究人員製造。這就是計算機應有的樣子。</p><p>And this is what computers will run in the future. And we have a whole lineup for enterprise now.<br>這就是未來計算機將運行的樣子。我們現在爲企業準備了完整的產品線。</p><p>From little tiny one to workstation ones, the server ones to supercomputer ones. And these will be available by all of our partners.<br>從微型設備到工作站，再到服務器和超級計算機。這些都將通過我們所有的合作伙伴提供。</p><p>We will also revolutionize the rest of the computing stack. Okay, so you can see that we’re in the process of revolutionizing the world’s enterprise.<br>我們還將徹底改變計算堆棧的其餘部分。好的，所以你可以看到我們正在徹底改變全球企業計算。</p><p>We’re also announcing today this incredible model that everybody can run. And we can make it possible to be enterprise ready for any company.<br>我們今天還宣佈了這個令人難以置信的模型，每個人都可以運行它。我們可以讓任何公司都能輕鬆實現企業級應用。</p><p>And it’s now completely open source. It’s part of our system we call NIMS. And you can download it.<br>它現在完全開源了。它是我們稱爲 NIMS 系統的一部分。你可以下載它。</p><p>You can run it anywhere. You can run it on DGX Spark. You can run it on DGX station. You can run on any of the servers that the OEMs make.<br>你可以在任何地方運行它。可以在 DGX Spark 上運行。可以在 DGX Station 上運行。可以在 OEM 製造的任何服務器上運行。</p><p>You can run it in the cloud. You can integrate it into any of your agentic AI frameworks. Let’s talk about robots.<br>你可以在雲端運行它。你可以將它集成到你的任何智能體 AI 框架中。讓我們談談機器人。</p><p>Well, the time has come. The time has come for robots.<br>嗯，時機已到。機器人時代已經到來。</p><p>Robots have the benefit of being able to interact with the physical world and do things that otherwise digital information cannot.<br>機器人具有與物理世界互動並完成數字信息無法完成的事情的優勢。</p><p>Physical AI and robotics are moving so fast. Everybody pay attention to this space. This could very well likely be the largest industry of all.<br>物理 AI 和機器人技術發展如此之快。大家請關注這個領域。這很可能成爲所有行業中最大的一個。</p><p>And so today we’re announcing something really, really special. It is a partnership of three companies. DeepMind, Disney Research, and NVIDIA.<br>因此，今天我們要宣佈一件非常非常特別的事情。這是三家公司的合作：DeepMind、迪士尼研究院和英偉達。</p><p>And we call it Newton. Okay. We have another amazing news. Today we’re announcing that Groot N1 is open-sourced.<br>我們稱之爲 Newton。好的。我們還有另一個驚人的消息。今天我們宣佈 Groot N1 開源了。</p><p>I want to thank all of you for coming to GTC. We talked about several things. One, Blackwell is in full production.<br>我想感謝大家來到 GTC。我們討論了幾件事。第一，Blackwell 已全面投產。</p><p>Second, Blackwell NVLink 72 with Dynamo is 40 times the performance, AI factory performance of Hopper.<br>第二，配備 Dynamo 的 Blackwell NVLink 72，其 AI 工廠性能是 Hopper 的 40 倍。</p><p>Third, we have annual rhythm of roadmaps that has been laid out for you so that you could plan your AI infrastructure.<br>第三，我們制定了年度節奏的路線圖供大家參考，以便你們規劃自己的 AI 基礎設施。</p><p>And then we have three AI infrastructures we’re building. AI infrastructure for the cloud, AI infrastructure for enterprise, and AI infrastructure for robots.<br>然後，我們正在構建三種 AI 基礎設施：面向雲的 AI 基礎設施、面向企業的 AI 基礎設施，以及面向機器人的 AI 基礎設施。</p><p>Possible.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?</p><p>Neil<br>Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.</p><p>Beth<br>Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.</p><p>Neil<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.</p><p>Beth<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.</p><p>Neil<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.</p><p>Beth<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.</p><p>Neil<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.</p><p>Ruth Alexander<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.</p><p>Neil<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.</p><p>Beth<br>As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?</p><p>Neil<br>I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.</p><p>Beth<br>Varieties of something are different types of it.</p><p>Neil<br>If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.</p><p>Beth<br>If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.</p><p>Neil<br>To give it a go means to try doing something.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable. Once again our six minutes are up. If you’ve enjoyed this programme, why not try practising the new vocabulary you’ve learned with our worksheet – it’s available to download now from our website, bbclearningenglish.com… and you could also try out the quiz while you’re there! Goodbye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?<br>我是贝丝。Neil，您经常吃什么类型的食物？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.<br>嗯，让我吃饱的基本东西 —— 那种面包、土豆。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.<br>嗯，像这样很多人经常吃的食物，被称为主食。在英国，面包是一种流行的主食，但对于世界大部分地区来说，还有另一种食物是第一大食物：米饭。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.<br>没错。世界上超过一半的人口以大米为主食，尤其是在亚洲。但水稻是一种非常“缺水”的作物，需要大量的水才能生长，由于气候变化造成的干旱和洪水，这正在成为一个问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>在本节目中，我们将听到一项开创性的新技术，该技术帮助农民在面对不断变化的气候时种植水稻。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到该程序的所有词汇，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。刚才我提到水稻是一种非常“口渴”的作物 —— 那么种植一公斤水需要多少水呢？是：a） 1,000 到 3,000 升吗？b） 3,000 至 5,000 升？或者，c） 5,000 至 7,000 升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.<br>我要说的是 c） 5,000 到 7,000 升。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。Yvonne Pinto 博士是位于菲律宾的国际水稻研究所（简称 IRRI）的总干事。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》解释了更多关于大米在全球流行的情况：</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto(YvonnePinto医师)<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.<br>世界上 50% 到 56% 的人口以大米为主要主食。现在，大约有 40 亿人，它是真正广泛种植的商品之一，尤其是在南亚和东南亚。但在非洲等大陆，人们对它的需求越来越大，当然也有拉丁美洲和欧洲的大米品种。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.<br>大米是一种商品，一种可以买卖的产品。与其他作物一样，大米也有多种类型，例如糙米、长粒米或印度樟米。今天对水稻的大部分研究都集中在培育能够适应不断变化的环境并在水过多或过少的条件下生长的新品种。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.<br>世界上超过一半的人口吃大米，非洲和欧洲的需求也在不断增长，因此很明显，全世界对大米都有胃口和强烈的愿望。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.<br>那么，是否有可能以更环保的方式种植水稻呢？大米公司 Tilda 的董事 Jean-Philippe Laborde 认为，答案在于一种称为交替湿式干燥（简称 AWD）的新种植技术。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:<br>为了种植水稻，农民会经历淹没田地或稻田的循环，然后稻田干涸，需要再次被淹没。使用 AWD 时，测量管被放置在地下 15 厘米处，以便农民可以检查田地任何部分的水位。通常，水稻需要 25 次洪水和干燥循环才能生长，但使用 AWD 可以减少到 20 次循环，从而为农民节省用水并减少甲烷排放。这是让-菲利普·拉博德 （Jean-Philippe Laborde） 告诉 BBC 国际频道《食物链》的主持人露丝·亚历山大 （Ruth Alexander） 他是如何开始对印度农民进行 AWD 实验的：</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.<br>去年，我们有 1,268 名农民应用了这种 AWD 技术来减少甲烷总排放量。</p><p>Ruth Alexander(露丝·亚历山大)<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?<br>您是如何说服那些农民试一试的？</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.<br>这相当具有挑战性，因为显然，对于农民来说，主要挑战是担心失去收入。他们需要在作物结束时看到切实的结果……他们显然得到了更好的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.<br>许多印度农民都加入了让-菲利普的实验。如果您参与某事，即表示您同意行动计划并参与其中。换句话说，你试一试 – 你尝试做一些事情，看看它是否有效。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?<br>事实证明，新技术产生了切实的结果，结果是真实且可衡量的。使用 AWD，种植水稻所需的水和电量减少，甲烷气体排放量减少，最重要的是，水稻产量增加……对，Neil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.<br>我问种植 1 公斤水需要多少升水，答案是 3,000 到 5,000 升水，非常口渴，但并不像你想象的那么口渴。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从商品开始，一种可以买卖的产品，比如大米。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Varieties of something are different types of it.<br>某物的种类是它的不同类型的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.<br>如果对某样东西有胃口，就会有强烈的愿望或需求。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.<br>如果你同意一个想法或计划，你就同意做某事并参与其中。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To give it a go means to try doing something.<br>To give it a go 的意思是尝试做某事。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>It makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m not surprised. That sounds great.</p><p>Pippa<br>So, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?</p><p>Pippa<br>I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.</p><p>Pippa<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.</p><p>Neil<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.</p><p>Pippa<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.</p><p>Pippa<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.</p><p>Neil<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.</p><p>Pippa<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.</p><p>Neil<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?</p><p>Pippa<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.</p><p>Pippa<br>Nice.</p><p>Neil<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.</p><p>Pippa<br>A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.</p><p>Neil<br>The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.</p><p>Pippa<br>If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.</p><p>Neil<br>A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.</p><p>Pippa<br>And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil?<br>我是 Pippa。在这个节目中，我们谈论的是幸福。那么，是什么让你快乐呢，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>It makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?<br>当我和一群老朋友在一起，我们开怀大笑时，我很高兴。你呢，皮帕？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy.<br>猫让我非常高兴。特别是如果我在街上看到一只我不认识的猫，它让我轻轻抚摸它。这总是让我很高兴。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m not surprised. That sounds great.<br>我并不感到惊讶。这听起来不错。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>So, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH.<br>所以，快乐对不同的人意味着不同的事情，但可以肯定的是，大多数人都希望快乐。喜马拉雅山上的不丹王国通过国民幸福总值 （GNH） 的理念将其提升到一个新的水平。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?<br>我们很快就会听到更多关于 Gross National Happiness 的信息，并学习一些有用的新词汇，但首先 Pippa，我有一个问题要问你。当然，不仅仅是不丹人民想要快乐。事实上，联合国甚至宣布了国际幸福日。但那是什么时候呢？国际幸福日是：a） 3 月 20 日吗？b） 6 月 20 日？c） 11 月 20 日？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.<br>我要说的是 6 月 20 日，因为英国会阳光明媚。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.<br>好的，让我们看看您是否在节目结束时。现在，简而言之，国民幸福总值意味着通过可持续和生态友好型发展来保护不丹的自然环境和文化。不丹政府认为这些目标比不惜一切代价发展经济更重要。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>多年来，不丹一直与外界隔绝 —— 第一批外国游客于 1974 年抵达，而电视直到 1999 年才被引入。不丹国王希望使国家现代化，并赋予其现代技术的好处，但又不损害传统文化，因此他邀请外部专家来发展国民幸福总值的想法。其中一位专家是 Ha Vinh Tho 博士，他在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 的主持人 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈：</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho(HaVinhTho医师)<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.<br>所以，他的想法是：’我们如何在不失去文化、环境和强大的社会结构的情况下实现国家的现代化和开放？因为不丹是亚洲唯一从未被殖民的国家之一，所以它的文化非常完整和充满活力，主要是佛教文化。因此，我们的想法是，国民幸福总值应该是所有政府决策和政策的重点。</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.<br>因此，公民的福祉和幸福成为中心议题。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.<br>不丹拥有强大的社会结构，这意味着社区内部有良好的关系，这些关系将社会团结在一起。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.<br>与其他亚洲国家不同，不丹从未被殖民，因此其佛教文化和传统完好无损 —— 它们是完整且未受破坏的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.<br>因此，不丹人民的幸福成为中心，它成为最重要的事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.<br>不丹对幸福的重视受到了全世界的钦佩，但也存在问题。一个是不丹工人迁移到印度和其他国家，以寻找收入更高的工作和机会，这就是所谓的人才流失。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.<br>因此，在 2023 年，不丹国王宣布了一项耗资数百万美元的项目，名为“正念之城”，这是一座基于精神和环境原则建造的新喜马拉雅城市，全部由可再生能源提供动力。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>来自不丹的 Lhawang Ugyel 博士是该项目的主任，他与 BBC 国际频道的 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈， 调查.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.<br>该项目还旨在扭转不丹的人才流失。</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel(LhawangUgyel医生)<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.<br>目的是让当地人管理整个正念城市，所以从这个意义上说，这也是为了吸引已经离开的移民，他们在国外工作，获得了额外的技能，回到正念城市工作。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.<br>除了是一个未来主义的生态城市外，正念之城还希望通过吸引工人回到不丹来阻止不丹的人才流失。然后，这些当地工人可以通过提升技能来使用他们在国外学到的额外技能。技能提升是通过培训提高工人技能的过程。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.<br>国民幸福总值的概念听起来可能很不寻常，但看到不丹平衡经济增长和人民幸福感是很有趣的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…<br>是的，这是真的 —— 这让我想起了你的问题，尼尔……</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?<br>是的，我问你国际幸福日的日期是哪一天？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.<br>我说那是英国夏天的 6 月 20 日。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.<br>嗯，也许这对南半球的人们更好，因为现在是 3 月 20 日。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Nice.<br>好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com!

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.</p><p>Neil<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.</p><p>Beth<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say polio.</p><p>Neil<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.</p><p>Beth<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.</p><p>Neil<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.</p><p>Beth<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.</p><p>Neil<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.</p><p>Beth<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.</p><p>Neil<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.</p><p>Beth<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?</p><p>Beth<br>And I said polio. Was I right?</p><p>Neil<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.</p><p>Beth<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.</p><p>Beth<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.</p><p>Neil<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon. Bye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.<br>我是贝丝。在我们的一生中，每 5 人中就有 1 人会受到癌症的影响，癌症是一种细胞不受控制地生长并导致体内肿瘤的疾病。肿瘤可以是良性的，即非癌性，也可以是恶性的，即癌性，到 2022 年，全球估计有 970 万人死于恶性癌症。但在这个节目中，我们将专注于一些好消息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.<br>疫苗是通过使人体免受某种疾病的免疫来保护人体的药物。现在，在开发一种名为 mRNA 的新疫苗方面，出现了一个突然而重要的发现 —— 一个突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>那么，癌症疫苗会很快成为现实吗？这就是我们将要发现的，以及学习一些有用的新单词和短语。请记住，如果您喜欢听六分钟英语并想同时阅读，您可以在我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com 上找到该节目的文字记录。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?<br>现在我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。我们已经提到了一些最新的疫苗，但第一个成功的疫苗治疗了哪种疾病？是：a） 流感？b） 脊髓灰质炎？或 c） 天花？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say polio.<br>我要说的是小儿麻痹症。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>还行！好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。您可能想知道为什么身体的免疫系统不自动对抗癌症。原因是癌症有巧妙的方式躲避我们的自然防御，正如田纳西州肿瘤学研究主任 Meredith McKean 博士向 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 解释的那样：</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean(MeredithMcKean博士)<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.<br>有许多研究表明，癌症已经开发出不同的技术，能够发出信号或蛋白质，本质上是在癌细胞的表面，告诉免疫系统，’走开！这里没什么可看的！因此，它实际上是劫持了这些受体，基本上是告诉免疫系统放松刹车，在对抗癌症方面更加积极。这确实让免疫疗法在过去十年中取得了突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.<br>McKean 博士说，许多研究已经证明了癌症是如何扩散的。她使用短语 a number of 来表示几个，但这也使她的说法更有说服力，因为当然，几项研究总比一项好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.<br>癌细胞通过假装是健康细胞来关闭免疫系统。就好像他们在说 Nothing to see here！– 一个非正式的短语，可以用来鼓励人们以俏皮的方式移动或移开某物，或者掩盖某物。例如，犯罪现场的警察可能会说，“这里没什么可看的！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.<br>所以，换句话说，癌症劫持了健康的细胞 —— 它控制了不属于它的东西，并利用它为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>那么，疫苗将如何改变现状呢？好吧，现有的治疗方法，如化疗，积极地针对癌症，但也攻击健康组织，产生令人不快的副作用。另一方面，新的突破性疫苗重新训练免疫系统识别癌细胞并自然地消除这些细胞 —— 即使是已经患有这种疾病的患者。以下是德克萨斯州安德森癌症中心的爱德华多·桑切斯 （Eduardo Sanchez） 教授向 BBC 国际频道的 The Inquiry 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez(EduardoSanchez教授)<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.<br>基本上，癌细胞在告诉免疫系统，’不要攻击我，不要吃我’，对吧？免疫系统已经忘记了如何识别这些癌细胞，对识别癌细胞产生的那些畸变变得盲目，我们想用疫苗做的是重新教育免疫系统。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.<br>在癌症患者中，免疫系统对癌变的生长视而不见 —— 它完全没有注意到它们或意识到它们的危险，因此疫苗以不同的方式重新教育免疫系统或教它行为。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.<br>回顾一下，一些癌症治疗通过疏通我们受阻的自然防御来起作用，而疫苗则重新训练免疫系统以自然地发现和攻击癌细胞。由于这两种方法完全不同，因此它们可以一起使用，也可以单独使用。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?<br>所以，回答我最初的问题，Neil，癌症疫苗可能并不遥远。但是你的问题怎么样 —— 现在是不是该透露答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?<br>我问哪种疾病首先被疫苗成功治疗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I said polio. Was I right?<br>我说的是小儿麻痹症。我是对的吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.<br>恐怕你错了。正确的选项是 C，即天花。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从突破开始，一个突然的、戏剧性的和重要的发现。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.<br>许多事物意味着几个或许多，可以增加你所说的可信度。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.<br>短语 Nothing to see here！用于阻止人们注意或过于仔细地观察某物，或将他们移开。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.<br>如果你劫持了什么东西，你就利用了不属于你的东西来为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.<br>对某事视而不见意味着没有注意到它或将其视为威胁。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it!

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.</p><p>Beth<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Haleigh Hurst<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.</p><p>Beth<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.</p><p>Neil<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.</p><p>Beth<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Maanvi Sharma<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.</p><p>Neil<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.</p><p>Beth<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.</p><p>Beth<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.</p><p>Neil<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.</p><p>Beth<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.</p><p>Neil<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!</p><p>Neil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.<br>我是贝丝。在这个节目中，我们将讨论社交媒体在年轻人生活中的积极和消极因素。这是目前一个非常热门的话题，因为澳大利亚正在讨论一项限制 16 岁以下儿童使用社交媒体的新法律。Neil，告诉我在你的生活中拥有社交媒体的一件好事和一件坏事。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.<br>嗯，一件好事是我可以看到住在很远的朋友在做什么，一件坏事是它真的会让人上瘾，而且会浪费大量时间。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>嗯，Neil 听听男性的观点很有趣，因为当谈到网络欺凌等问题时，受影响最大的往往是年轻女性，所以很快我们就会听到不同国家&#x2F;地区的女性讲述她们的在线经历。请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到所有词汇和工作表，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。2024 年，世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个？是：a） Facebook？b） Instagram？或 c） TikTok？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.<br>哦，我要说的是 TikTok。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，让我们从社交媒体的积极一面开始。作为俄克拉荷马大学（Oklahoma University）的一名政治专业学生，21岁的哈利·赫斯特（Haleigh Hurst）参加了2024年美国总统大选。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 解释了社交媒体的一个好处：</p><p>Haleigh Hurst(哈利·赫斯特)<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.<br>我确实认为社交媒体在教育年轻选民了解不同的政策和不同的竞选人方面发挥了巨大作用。我知道特朗普最近说，他心里对 TikTok 情有独钟。随着社交媒体的发展，它引发了更多的辩论。我想我们这一代人也见过很多高潮的事情发生。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.<br>Haleigh 认为社交媒体的一个好处是它引发了辩论和对话 —— 它导致辩论开始。她评论说唐纳德·特朗普是社交媒体的粉丝，他说他对TikTok情有独钟。如果你对某事或某人情有独钟，你会感到深情和喜欢它；你很喜欢它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.<br>但当然，这并不是故事的全部。越来越多的年轻女性报告了社交媒体对她们生活的负面影响，以及她们在网上显得“完美”的压力，尤其是来自男性的压力。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>Maanvi Sharma 现年 28 岁，是一名女商人和模特，在 Instagram 上拥有大量粉丝，居住在印度德里。Kemi Adeyemi 是一位来自尼日利亚拉各斯的 26 岁旅游博主。这两位年轻女性都在 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 中讨论了这些社交媒体上的担忧：</p><p>Maanvi Sharma(马安维·夏尔马)<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…<br>…你正在约会的人，他们可能会因为社交媒体而离开你。他们可能会认为你不适合，你知道的，像……你不能因为你在社交媒体上而成为一个好的伙伴，因为你被很多人看着，他们对此感到有点害怕……“你知道吗，我们看到了你的女朋友 —— 哦，我的天哪！她穿着这个，天哪！但它正在影响我的个人生活……</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi(凯米·阿德耶米)<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.<br>有些人或有些人，他们希望你缩小自己，这样他们就可以成为更大的人。他们可以听你的朋友怎么说你，你的家人怎么说你，但他们无法站出来为你说，’哦，我认识这个人。我相信她不是因为其他原因做这些事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.<br>Maanvi 认为一些男人被她在 Instagram 上的受欢迎程度吓倒了。Intimidated 的意思是因为你缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。她感觉到人们会八卦她的帖子和照片，使用诸如“哦，我的天哪”和“哦，我的上帝”之类的表达来表达他们的震惊或惊讶。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.<br>凯米同意。她说，在社交媒体上，有些人希望她缩小自己，这句话的意思是你没有充分利用自己的潜力，以避免让人们感到不舒服，或者为了融入。当她在网上被欺负时，凯米说这些人不会为她挺身而出。To stand up for someone 的意思是为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持。我认为你是时候透露你问题的答案了，Neil。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?<br>我问 2024 年世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个 —— Facebook、Instagram 还是 TikTok？你怎么说贝丝？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>TikTok.<br>TikTok的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.<br>恐怕你错了。它是 Facebook，拥有超过 30 亿的固定用户。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从动词 spark 开始，意思是导致某事开始发生，例如辩论或争论。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.<br>如果你对某人情有独钟，你就会对他们产生感情；你很喜欢他们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.<br>To be intimidated 的意思是因为您对某种情况缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.<br>“Oh my gosh！”和“Oh my God！”这些表达是对强烈情绪的感叹，如震惊、惊讶、愤怒或不相信。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.<br>如果你缩小自己，你就会让自己变得更小，并且不会充分利用你的潜力来让别人感到舒适，或者为了适应他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!<br>最后，To stand up for someone 的意思是大声疾呼地为遭受霸凌的人辩护。我们的时间又一次到了！但是，如果您准备好了解更多，请前往 BBC Learning English 网站尝试带有此计划的测验工作表！期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_001.png" class="" title="snapshot_001.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_002.png" class="" title="snapshot_002.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_003.png" class="" title="snapshot_003.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_004.png" class="" title="snapshot_004.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_005.png" class="" title="snapshot_005.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_006.png" class="" title="snapshot_006.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_007.png" class="" title="snapshot_007.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_008.png" class="" title="snapshot_008.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_009.png" class="" title="snapshot_009.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_010.png" class="" title="snapshot_010.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_011.png" class="" title="snapshot_011.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_012.png" class="" title="snapshot_012.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_013.png" class="" title="snapshot_013.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_014.png" class="" title="snapshot_014.png"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="a-soft-spot"><a href="#a-soft-spot" class="headerlink" title="a soft spot"></a>a soft spot</h4><p>an affectionate liking or fondness for someone or something<br>对…特别偏爱<br>对某人或某事物怀有深厚的喜爱或偏爱<br>He has a soft spot for his niece.<br>他特别疼爱他的侄女。</p><h4 id="spark"><a href="#spark" class="headerlink" title="spark"></a>spark</h4><p>cause (a debate, conversation, fight etc) to start happening<br>引发<br>引起（一场辩论、谈话、争吵等）的发生<br>Her speech sparked a heated debate.<br>她的讲话引发了一场激烈的辩论。</p><h4 id="intimidated"><a href="#intimidated" class="headerlink" title="intimidated"></a>intimidated</h4><p>frightened or nervous because of a lack of confidence<br>受恐吓的<br>由于缺乏自信而感到害怕或紧张<br>I was intimidated by his aggressive manner.<br>他的咄咄逼人的态度让我感到害怕。</p><h4 id="Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God"><a href="#Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God" class="headerlink" title="Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!"></a>Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!</h4><p>expression of feelings such as shock, surprise, anger, disbelief<br>我的天哪！<br>表达震惊、惊讶、愤怒、不相信等情绪的感叹词<br>Oh my gosh, did you see that car crash?<br>我的天哪，你看到那场车祸了吗？</p><h4 id="shrink-yourself"><a href="#shrink-yourself" class="headerlink" title="shrink yourself"></a>shrink yourself</h4><p>make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable<br>缩小自己<br>为了让别人感到舒服而让自己变得渺小，不发挥全部潜能<br>Don’t shrink yourself; let your talent shine.<br>别妄自菲薄；让你的才能闪光。</p><h4 id="stand-up-for-someone"><a href="#stand-up-for-someone" class="headerlink" title="stand up for (someone)"></a>stand up for (someone)</h4><p>be vocal in defending or supporting a person who is being criticised or bullied<br>为…辩护<br>大声疾呼为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持<br>She always stands up for the underdog.<br>她总是为弱者辩护。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.</p><p>Beth<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Phil<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?</p><p>Beth<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.</p><p>Phil<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.</p><p>Megan Lawton<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.</p><p>Beth<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.</p><p>Phil<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.</p><p>Beth<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:</p><p>Dr William Brady<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.</p><p>Phil<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.</p><p>Beth<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.</p><p>Phil<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question.

Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.<br>如果你使用互联网，而且几乎每个人都使用互联网，你可能读过这样的头条新闻：你不会相信这位名人做了什么整容手术！像这样的标题被称为点击诱饵，用来吸引你的注意力并让你阅读更多内容。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>但现在，一种称为愤怒诱饵的新趋势正在社交媒体上传播。愤怒诱饵是旨在让您生气或愤怒的在线内容。在这个节目中，我们将探索愤怒诱饵的趋势，并且像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些都可以在我们的网站上找到，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?<br>很好，但首先是我的问题，贝丝，这是关于我们一直在使用的两个术语：“点击诱饵”和“愤怒诱饵”。两者都包含“诱饵”一词，但它的实际含义是什么？诱饵是否：a） 强烈的愤怒感？b） 用钩子钓鱼或动物的食物？c） 一个计算机软件？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.<br>我相当有信心它是 b） – 食物上钩。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。愤怒诱饵的工作原理是这样的：创作者在网上发布挑衅性内容，可能是一条消息，或者一个视频。人们看到它，感到愤怒，并愤怒地评论。其他人看到它、喜欢它并分享它。无论哪种方式，内容都会引起兴趣，增加互联网流量并为创作者赚钱。以下是营销策略师 Andrea Jones 向 BBC 世界服务节目主持人 Megan Lawton 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.<br>他们创建的内容越多，他们获得的参与度就越高，他们获得的报酬就越多。所以他们会做任何事情……一些创作者会不惜一切代价获得更多观看次数，因为他们获得的观看次数越多，他们获得的报酬就越多，即使这些观看次数是负面的或煽动人们的愤怒和愤怒。</p><p>Megan Lawton(梅根·劳顿)<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]<br>Andrea，愤怒诱饵与点击诱饵或其他在线策略有何不同？[…]</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.<br>作为一名营销人员，我总是，你知道的，指导我的客户，并与他们讨论在他们的营销中使用钩子，对吧？我认为 hook 和 rage bait 甚至它失传已久的表亲 clickbait 内容之间的区别……当我们考虑一个钩子时，对我来说，钩子准确地反映了该内容中的内容，它来自一个信任的地方，而愤怒诱饵的内容则被设计为纵性的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.<br>Andrea 说，帖子得到的反应越多，创作者赚的钱就越多，即使这些反应是仇恨的。她使用结构，一件事发生得越多，其他事情发生得越多，来表明当一件事反复发生时，另一件事也会因此而增加。例如，你练习英语的次数越多，你的进步就越大。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.<br>这些内容旨在煽动愤怒 —— 鼓励令人不快或暴力的反应，这并不重要。这就是为什么 Andrea 认为愤怒诱饵比点击诱饵更糟糕。虽然点击诱饵的内容更真实，但愤怒诱饵是纵性的，这意味着它试图影响某事以使其自身有利。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:<br>所以，不难看出为什么很多人认为愤怒诱饵是有毒的。所以，如果你想知道人们为什么首先会做出反应，请听听威廉·布雷迪博士向 BBC 世界服务部《商业日报》解释愤怒诱饵背后的心理学：</p><p>Dr William Brady(WilliamBrady博士)<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.<br>如果你是一个有影响力的人，你想弄清楚，’好吧，我如何在我的内容上获得更多的眼球？嗯，你需要利用我们在心理学中存在的那些偏见，因为那是我们将更加关注的内容。反过来，这就是算法将放大的内容，这最终意味着更多的广告收入。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.<br>有影响力的人希望他们的内容有更多的眼球 —— 更多的人查看他们的网站或社交媒体帖子 —— 并利用人类心理学来做到这一点。从心理学上讲，我们都有偏见 – 感觉 – 这些偏见通常是无意识的，要么支持要么反对某个想法或一群人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.<br>偏见是情绪化的，由于倾听我们的情绪对人类物种的进化至关重要，创作者知道激发我们的情绪会吸引我们的注意力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.<br>那么，可以做些什么来对抗愤怒诱饵呢？好吧，在做出反应之前，我们都可以花点时间思考一下。请记住，分享一些离谱的东西可能会让事情变得更糟，同时也会让创作者变得更富有。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.<br>好的，Phil，让我们揭示你问题的答案。你问我什么是“诱饵”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?<br>我做了。正确答案是 b） 把食物挂在钩子上以捕捉鱼或动物，贝丝，你不是这么说的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yes.<br>是的，是的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.<br>又对了！好，让我们回顾一下我们在该计划中学到的词汇，从愤怒诱饵开始，社交媒体内容旨在激起愤怒，从而鼓励人们参与其中。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.<br>结构，越多…越…描述一件事反复发生导致另一件事也发生的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.<br>To agite someone 的意思是鼓励他们做或感受不愉快或暴力的事情。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.<br>形容词 manipulative 描述了试图影响或控制某人以为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.<br>Eyeballs 是一个非正式词，指的是观看特定网站或电视节目的人数。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!<br>最后，偏见是感觉，通常是无意识的，支持或反对一个想法或一群人。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8715.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片15.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="rage-bait"><a href="#rage-bait" class="headerlink" title="rage bait"></a>rage bait</h4><p>social media content designed to provoke an emotional reaction so that people engage with the content thereby generating income for the online creator<br>愤怒诱饵<br>旨在激起情绪反应的社交媒体内容，以便人们参与其中，从而为网络创作者带来收入。<br>The inflammatory post was pure rage bait, designed to maximize engagement and profit.<br>煽动性的帖子纯粹是愤怒诱饵，旨在最大限度地提高参与度和利润。</p><h4 id="the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…"><a href="#the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…" class="headerlink" title="the more (X)… the more (Y)…"></a>the more (X)… the more (Y)…</h4><p>as one thing (X) happens repeatedly, another thing (Y) happens more as a result<br>越…越…<br>一件事情(X)反复发生，另一件事情(Y)的结果就越多。<br>The more he studied, the more confident he became in his abilities.<br>他学习越多，就越自信。</p><h4 id="incite"><a href="#incite" class="headerlink" title="incite"></a>incite</h4><p>encourage someone to do or feel something unpleasant or violent; stir up; provoke; rouse<br>煽动<br>鼓励某人做或感受令人不快或暴力的事情；煽动；挑衅；激起。<br>His inflammatory speech incited the mob to riot.<br>他煽动性的演讲煽动了暴民暴动。</p><h4 id="manipulative"><a href="#manipulative" class="headerlink" title="manipulative"></a>manipulative</h4><p>trying to influence or control someone to your advantage<br>操纵性的<br>试图利用他人达到自己的目的。<br>Her manipulative tactics alienated her friends.<br>她操纵性的策略使她疏远了朋友。</p><h4 id="eyeballs"><a href="#eyeballs" class="headerlink" title="eyeballs"></a>eyeballs</h4><p>the number of people viewing a particular website, television programme etc.<br>眼球数<br>观看特定网站、电视节目等的人数。<br>The new campaign attracted millions of eyeballs.<br>这项新活动吸引了数百万眼球。</p><h4 id="biases"><a href="#biases" class="headerlink" title="biases"></a>biases</h4><p>feelings, often hidden or unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people<br>偏见<br>经常是隐藏的或无意识的，对某种想法或人群的偏好或偏见。<br>Unconscious biases can significantly affect decision-making.<br>无意识的偏见会严重影响决策。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.</p><p>Beth<br>Very nice!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:</p><p>Marnie Chesterton<br>My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!</p><p>Phil<br>Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.</p><p>Beth<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.</p><p>Phil<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.</p><p>Beth<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.</p><p>Phil<br>Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.</p><p>Beth<br>Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?</p><p>Phil<br>Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.</p><p>Beth<br>It is, yeah!</p><p>Phil<br>Well done!</p><p>Beth<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.</p><p>Phil<br>The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.</p><p>Beth<br>When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.</p><p>Phil<br>The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.</p><p>Beth<br>If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal. Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you enjoyed listening to this programme, you’ll find many more, along with a worksheet with a quiz you can try, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.<br>我一直在想的一件事是，每栋房子或每个家庭都有一股气味。当你从长途旅行回来时，你可能真的会在自己的家里注意到这一点，当你踏入前门时，东西闻起来有点奇怪。虽然您的房子很有可能因为已经关闭了几周而闻起来很奇怪，但您也有可能闻到家通常闻起来的味道，但当您在那里时，您只是没有注意到它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.<br>特里斯坦说，当你离开后回到家时，你的房子很有可能闻起来很奇怪，这个形容词的意思是奇怪或不寻常。如果你说某事发生的可能性很大，你的意思是它发生的可能性很高。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:<br>事实是，每个家都有气味，尽管我们已经习惯了，但我们通常不会注意到。当我们吸气时，鼻子中的受体细胞会检测到空气中的分子，并将它们发送到大脑中的嗅觉器官。这些分析气味是否存在危险。你闻不到自己家的原因是它对你没有威胁。这是科学作家 Tristan Ahtone 再次向 BBC 国际服务节目 Unexpected Elements 解释更多内容：</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.<br>好吧，通过过滤掉常见的非威胁性气味，可以更容易地检测到可能危险的异常事物。所以，例如，如果你忘记了吐司，它开始燃烧，你通常会很快闻到这种气味，因为这是你所处环境的变化。然后，您大脑的其他部分开始发挥作用，将烟味理解为潜在的伤害或威胁。但是，即使我们无法闻到自己家的气味，它们的气味仍然很重要，因为它与我们对舒适和安全的认识纠缠在一起。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.<br>通过过滤掉熟悉的气味，我们的大脑能够检测到其他不寻常、不寻常或不常见且可能很危险的气味。To filter something out 的意思是从其他事物中删除或分离不需要的事物。例如，过滤掉家的气味意味着我们会注意到烤面包燃烧的气味或其他气味，提醒我们可能的危险。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.<br>尽管我们通常不会注意到家中的气味 —— 特殊的气味 —— 但它仍然对大脑处理记忆和情感的边缘系统产生影响。这就解释了为什么气味对我们的感受有如此强烈的影响，以及为什么我们在家里感到舒适和安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>对，Phil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.<br>是的，它是。我问你有多少百分比的人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。答案是 b） 5%，我想这就是你说的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yeah!<br>是的，是的！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well done!<br>干的好！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.<br>好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从嗅觉丧失开始，意思是没有嗅觉或嗅觉有限。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.<br>形容词 weird 的意思是奇怪、奇怪或奇异。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.<br>当有人说某事很有可能发生时，他们的意思是它很可能会发生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.<br>短语 out of the ordinary 的意思是不寻常、不常见或例外。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.<br>如果你过滤掉一些东西，你就会从物质中去除或分离不需要的东西。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal. Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you enjoyed listening to this programme, you’ll find many more, along with a worksheet with a quiz you can try, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

I’m Pippa.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>Now, Neil, have you ever wanted to be a musician?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh yes, Pippa, I still want to be a musician. I’ve been playing my guitar since I was 14.</p><p>Pippa<br>Wow. Well, maybe one day you’ll, you’ll manage it. Who knows?</p><p>Neil<br>What about you?</p><p>Pippa<br>I don’t think I’d like to be a musician. I think it would be a bit stressful. Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful.</p><p>Neil<br>Yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too.</p><p>Pippa<br>But first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley</p><p>Neil<br>Oh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.</p><p>Neil<br>This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.</p><p>Neil<br>When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.</p><p>Neil<br>The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.</p><p>Pippa<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.</p><p>Pippa<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.</p><p>Neil<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Of course I would.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall</p><p>Neil<br>Wow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com. We’ll also put a link in the notes below this episode!</p><p>Neil<br>OK. So, what about your question, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts? The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley? And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18.</p><p>Neil<br>Really? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well.</p><p>Pippa<br>OK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Songwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Neil<br>A bunch of people is a group of people.</p><p>Pippa<br>The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.</p><p>Pippa<br>Your main earner is your main source of income.</p><p>Neil<br>Gigs are musical concerts.</p><p>Pippa<br>And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too.<br>是的。我想知道音乐家的生活到底是什么样的？我们将在这个节目中发现这一点，因为我们听到英国各地一些想成为成功音乐家的人的声音，我们甚至还会听他们的一些音乐。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>But first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley<br>但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Neil。在英国，我们有该国最畅销歌曲的每周排行榜。最畅销的歌曲被称为第一名。但是，您认为哪位音乐艺术家的英国排名第一的歌曲最多？a） 披头士乐队 b） 艾德·希兰 c） 猫王</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles.<br>哦，好吧，我觉得这很容易。肯定是披头士乐队。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?<br>好吧，我会在节目结束时透露答案。现在，获得第一名是许多音乐家的梦想。但是，如果你想成为一名音乐家，你从哪里开始呢？</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson(贝利·汤姆金森)<br>I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.<br>我在圣艾夫斯一个非常丰富的音乐环境中长大。我从大约 11 岁开始就开始打开麦克风。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.<br>这是贝利。她住在英格兰西南海岸康沃尔郡的圣艾夫斯。她说她从小就打算参加 Open Mic 之夜。Open Mic 之夜是任何人都可以唱歌或播放音乐的活动。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.<br>Bailey 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中谈到了她作为音乐家的生活。</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson(贝利·汤姆金森)<br>I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years.

But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.<br>我会去 Kettle 的这些词曲作者圈子，眨眨眼，比如，周五放学后，我会成为最年轻的 50 岁的人。但我会和一群老人围坐在一个圈子里，他们会演奏 James Taylor、Carole King 和 The Eagles 以及很多 70 年代的音乐，我想这对我影响很大。但我想，你知道，每个人都把我放在他们的羽翼下。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.<br>年轻时，贝利去了词曲作者圈子。这些会议是为有兴趣创作自己的音乐的人准备的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.<br>Bailey 记得和一群老人坐在一起。A bunch 是谈论一群人的非正式方式。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.<br>乐队中的老人们会演奏 1970 年代的音乐，贝利说他们把她放在自己的羽翼下。如果你把某人放在你的羽翼下，你就会决定保护他们或引导他们。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.<br>让我们来认识另一位音乐家 Josh。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.<br>所以，我在大约 13 岁的时候学会了我的第一首正式的吉他歌曲。我真的在我能做到的那一刻就开始表演了。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.<br>Josh 住在伦敦，是一名街头艺人。这意味着他在街上或公共场所表演以赚钱。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.<br>街头表演是音乐家赚钱和向更多人表演的常见方式。正如 Josh 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中所说的那样，它可以帮助音乐家获得新的机会。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.<br>这有点像我的主要收入来源，让我在过去十年左右的时间里一直坚持下去。从那时起，它为我带来了各种不同的机会。它有我所有的演出，它有我所有的人脉。所以我欠街头表演很多。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.<br>街头表演是 Josh 的主要收入来源，也是他的主要资金来源。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.<br>他说，街头表演让他获得了所有的演出和人脉。演出是音乐会。这是一个非正式的俚语。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Phil<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.</p><p>Phil<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:</p><p>Adam Chandler<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.</p><p>Beth<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.</p><p>Phil<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.</p><p>Beth<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.</p><p>Phil<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.</p><p>Beth<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.</p><p>Phil<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.</p><p>Beth<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.</p><p>Phil<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.</p><p>Beth<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.</p><p>Phil<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!</p><p>Phil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?<br>不管你喜欢还是讨厌，毫无疑问，快餐很受欢迎。贝丝，你是快餐迷吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.<br>呃，不是真的，不是。我认为有时它可能非常方便，显然是因为它很快，但并非真的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.<br>好吧，无论你怎么看它们，像肯德基、达美乐，当然还有大麦当劳这样的快餐品牌，都取得了令人难以置信的成功。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在本节目中，我们将讨论快餐从 1950 年代美国开始的全球传播。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?<br>但首先，我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。英国大约有多少家快餐店？是：a） 4,000 个？b） 42,000 人？或者，c） 四百万？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.<br>我要选 b） 42,000。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:<br>好的，稍后我们会找出答案。在美国，自 1950 年代以来，汉堡包、炸薯条和奶昔等廉价易行的食物一直很受欢迎。请听亚当·钱德勒 （Adam Chandler） 讲述 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》（The Food Chain） 的故事，该书追溯了美国快餐的历史，该书的作者 Drive-Thru Dreams 讲述了这一切是如何开始的：</p><p>Adam Chandler(亚当·钱德勒)<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.<br>快餐故事的核心是一种非常 “任何人都可以做到 ”的感觉。许多公司创始人没有大学学位，在很多情况下没有高中学历，不是靠金钱赚钱的，他们通常只是准备将自己插入一个适合他们的系统的人。它确实做到了。在那个时代，机会变得非常、非常容易，因为这是美国经验的新部分。所以，在很小的方面，美国梦在很大程度上变成了美国梦。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.<br>快餐的兴起反映了二战后美国经济实力的崛起。当 Adam 说这是故事的核心时，他的意思是这是故事中最重要的部分。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.<br>在 1950 年代，当我们今天所知道的著名品牌刚刚起步时，任何具有积极进取的态度的人都可以销售快餐。“我能行”的态度描述了一个有信心并决心解决问题并取得成果的人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.<br>这正是 Kentucky Fried Chicken 和 McDonald’s 等成功餐厅发生的事情。对许多人来说，这些快餐品牌象征着美国梦 —— 即在美国，任何人都可以通过努力工作和决心取得成功。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.<br>肯德基、麦当劳和其他公司的成功不仅限于美国。如今，您可以参观地球两侧的两家麦当劳，并吃完全相同的饭菜。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.<br>但并不是每个国家都张开怀抱欢迎 —— 冰岛这个小岛就是其中之一。安迪·索菲亚·方丹 （Andie Sophia Fontaine） 曾经在麦当劳工作，现在是《冰岛评论》的编辑。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain，当麦当劳开始在冰岛首都雷克雅未克销售汉堡时，它受到了冷遇。</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine(安迪·索菲亚·方丹)<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.<br>冰岛的汉堡文化由来已久。他们对汉堡包有自己的想法，他们将使用生菜、生黄瓜和一种炸酱 —— 称为 shalpuborgari，或商店汉堡，已经存在了很长时间。是的，所以麦当劳 —— 他们努力维持市场。棺材上的最后一枚钉子是 2008&#x2F;2009 年的全球金融危机。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.<br>冰岛已经有吃汉堡的悠久传统 —— 这一传统已经存在了很长时间。例如，shalpuborgari 或商店汉堡是美国汉堡包的变体。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.<br>麦当劳在冰岛并不像其他地方那样成功。而 2008 年的全球金融危机是棺材上的最后一枚钉子，这一事件导致了已经开始出错的事情的失败。直到今天，冰岛还没有麦当劳，不像英国，这让我想起了你的问题，菲尔。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.<br>是的。我问你英国有多少家快餐店。我问你是 4,000 人、42,000 人还是 400 万人。当然，答案是 42,000 个，所以你是对的，干得好！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从核心开始，意思是某事最重要的部分或原因。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.<br>如果你说某人有“我能行”的态度，你的意思是他们有信心采取行动、解决问题和应对新的挑战。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.<br>美国梦是相信如果努力工作，美国每个人都有机会获得成功和快乐。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.<br>这个形容词 long-based 的意思是已经存在了很长时间。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.<br>对某物的接受意味着一种变体，或一种新的呈现方式。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!<br>最后，谚语 the final nail in the coffin，指的是导致已经开始失败的事情最终结束的事件。我们的六分钟又一次结束了，但为什么不前往 BBC Learning English 网站，在那里您可以找到专门针对此计划的工作表和测验。期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="at-the-heart-of"><a href="#at-the-heart-of" class="headerlink" title="at the heart of"></a>at the heart of</h4><p>to be the most important part, or main cause, of something<br>核心<br>是某事最重要的部分或主要原因<br>The success of the project lies at the heart of our future plans.<br>项目的成功是未来计划的核心。</p><h4 id="can-do-attitude"><a href="#can-do-attitude" class="headerlink" title="can-do attitude"></a>can-do attitude</h4><p>showing determination and confidence to take action and achieve results<br>积极进取的态度<br>表现出决心和信心去采取行动并取得成果<br>Her can-do attitude impressed the interviewers.<br>她积极进取的态度给面试官留下了深刻印象。</p><h4 id="The-American-dream"><a href="#The-American-dream" class="headerlink" title="The American dream"></a>The American dream</h4><p>the idea that everyone in the United States of America has the chance to be successful and happy if they work hard<br>美国梦<br>在美国，只要努力工作，每个人都有机会获得成功和幸福的理念<br>He believed in the American dream, working tirelessly to achieve his goals.<br>他相信美国梦，为实现目标而不懈努力。</p><h4 id="long-standing"><a href="#long-standing" class="headerlink" title="long-standing"></a>long-standing</h4><p>having existed for a long time<br>长期存在的<br>存在了很长时间<br>There’s a long-standing dispute between the two countries.<br>两国之间存在长期争端。</p><h4 id="a-take-on-something"><a href="#a-take-on-something" class="headerlink" title="a take on (something)"></a>a take on (something)</h4><p>a variation of, or new way of presenting, something which already exists<br>对（某事物）的诠释；一种（新的）处理方法<br>对已存在事物的变体或新的呈现方式<br>His take on the classic novel was both innovative and insightful.<br>他对这部经典小说的诠释既有创新性又富于洞察力。</p><h4 id="the-final-nail-in-the-coffin"><a href="#the-final-nail-in-the-coffin" class="headerlink" title="the final nail in the coffin"></a>the final nail in the coffin</h4><p>(idiom) an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail<br>最后一击；致命的一击<br>（习语）导致已经开始失败的事物最终结束的事件<br>The loss of their biggest client was the final nail in the coffin for the company.<br>失去最大的客户是这家公司彻底倒闭的最后一击。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?</p><p>Beth<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.</p><p>Beth<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.</p><p>Beth<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.</p><p>Phil<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.</p><p>Beth<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.</p><p>Phil<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.</p><p>Rando Kuustik<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.</p><p>Beth<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.</p><p>Phil<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?</p><p>Beth<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.</p><p>Phil<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.</p><p>Beth<br>Rivals are competitors.</p><p>Phil<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz related to this programme, and we’ll see you again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?<br>所以，贝丝，我们谈论的是当今世界上最好的教育系统。你在英国上学。您如何看待英国的教育体系？你认为这可能是最好的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.<br>我认为它相当不错，我个人可能会改变它的一些事情，但我想说它相当不错，但可能不是世界上最好的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.<br>好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论 Pisa 排名。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.<br>该排名基于经合组织（OECD）每三年进行的一次测试。这些测试试图显示哪些国家在数学、科学和阅读教学方面最有效。但这真的可以衡量吗？嗯，这是前 BBC 教育记者肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 与 BBC 世界服务节目“全球故事”的对话。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.<br>当它们第一次被引入时，这是一个非常有争议的想法，因为人们说’你怎么可能比较大国……你怎么能把美国与卢森堡或中国的部分地区，或者其他什么地方进行比较呢？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.<br>肖恩说，这些测试是有争议的。如果某件事是有争议的，那么它就是人们可能会争论的事情 —— 它是有争议的。因此，起初，比萨测试是有争议的，因为不是每个人都认为比较非常不同的国家是公平的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?<br>Phil，我有一个关于他们的问题要问你。因此，在 2022 年，新加坡在阅读排名中名列前茅。但这些国家中哪些位居第二呢？是：a） 美国？b） 爱尔兰？或者，c） 英国？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.<br>我想可能是 b） 爱尔兰。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目结束时发现这是否正确。比萨排名的一个常见模式是，最成功的国家往往规模较小。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 在接受 BBC 国际频道节目“全球故事”采访时告诉我们，许多西欧大国在排名中的得分并不高。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.<br>他们被这些快速崛起的国家超越和超越 —— 你知道的，新加坡、爱沙尼亚、台湾，或者那些我们历史上不认为是经济竞争对手的地方，但我想 PISA 测试的论点是，如果你想拥有一种知识经济，一种基于技能的经济，这就是你衡量它的方式。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.<br>我们听说许多欧洲大国正在被小国超越。如果有人超过你，他们就会比你走得更快 —— 速度更高。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.<br>我们使用前缀 ‘out-‘ 来表示某人或某事更擅长做某事。我们还听说，小国“跑赢”大国 —— 它们的表现更好。新加坡、爱沙尼亚和台湾被描述为欧洲大国的经济竞争对手 —— 这意味着它们在经济上正在与这些国家竞争。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>我们还听说了知识经济。这是一个以服务行业为基础的经济，这些行业要求工人受过高等教育，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.<br>那么，是什么让各国在这些测试中表现得更好呢？让我们再次聆听 BBC 国际服务节目“全球故事”。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 告诉我们，那些优先考虑让每个人都达到一定水平的国家做得很好。我们还听取了爱沙尼亚学校校长 Rando Kuustik 的发言。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.<br>确保所有学生都能接受一定水平的教育达到一定标准的国家，无论他们的背景如何，都做得很好。</p><p>Rando Kuustik(兰多·库斯蒂克)<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.<br>如果你用不同的水平或能力来教他们，那么你就是在隔离他们，我们不想把世界上的任何人都隔离开来，为什么我们在学校里这样做呢？这是爱沙尼亚成功的主要原因之一。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.<br>Sean 说，最成功的系统将每个人都教育到特定的标准，无论他们的背景如何。如果一件事发生而不考虑其他事情，这意味着其他事情不重要，或者不是问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.<br>兰多·库斯蒂克 （Rando Kuustik） 说，爱沙尼亚的学校不想隔离学生。隔离的意思是分离和保持分离。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?<br>那么，我们刚刚听说了爱沙尼亚，但贝丝，您的问题呢？那些国家呢？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.<br>我问你，在 2022 年 Pisa 排名中，美国、爱尔兰和英国的阅读量排名第二。你说的是爱尔兰，这是正确的答案。干的好！好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的关于教育排名的词汇，从有争议的 - 争论的或有争议的开始。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.<br>如果你被某人超越，他们就会比你走得更快。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rivals are competitors.<br>竞争对手就是竞争对手。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>知识经济是一种基于需要受过高等教育的工人的行业，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.<br>如果某件事发生，而不考虑第二件事，那么第二件事对它的发生没有影响。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Most people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you?</p><p>Phil<br>I ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious!</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, OK. Good!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>But let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:</p><p>David Shirley<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.</p><p>Phil<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.</p><p>Phil<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.</p><p>Beth<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.</p><p>Beth<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.</p><p>Phil<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.</p><p>Beth<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:<br>但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain：</p><p>David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.<br>我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.<br>大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?<br>50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.<br>哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜：</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.<br>在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.<br>厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.<br>哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:<br>玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物：</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.<br>从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.<br>让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?<br>生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.<br>啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.<br>当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.<br>动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.<br>如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.<br>当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?</p><p>Beth<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.</p><p>Phil<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s around 80% water.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:</p><p>Professor John Speakman<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.</p><p>Phil<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.</p><p>Beth<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.</p><p>Phil<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.</p><p>Phil<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.</p><p>Beth<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.</p><p>Phil<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.</p><p>Phil<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.</p><p>Beth<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?<br>我是 Beth。如今，我经常看到人们随身携带水瓶以确保他们喝得足够。你每天喝多少水，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?<br>哦，我不知道。也许大约一升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?<br>还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.<br>我想大概是两升。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.<br>啊，嗯，很多人听说的数字是每天两升。当然，每个人都需要喝一些水 —— 人体的一半以上是由水组成的。但是，我们究竟需要多少水才能保持健康呢？这就是我们将在本节目中讨论的内容，以及一些有用的新词汇。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>说到词汇，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上下载该节目中的所有新单词和短语，以及帮助您学习它们的工作表练习，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?<br>太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s around 80% water.<br>我认为大约 80% 是水。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:<br>好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授：</p><p>Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.<br>所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.<br>Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.<br>是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.<br>然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.<br>实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.<br>但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.<br>而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.<br>Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.<br>因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.<br>如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.<br>这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.<br>一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.<br>脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Neil<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.</p><p>Beth<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.</p><p>Beth<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.</p><p>Neil<br>What was the voice?</p><p>Beth<br>Hello?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.</p><p>Neil<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Beth<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?</p><p>Neil<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.</p><p>Neil<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.</p><p>Beth<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.</p><p>Neil<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>James Gallagher<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.</p><p>Beth<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.</p><p>Neil<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.</p><p>Neil<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.</p><p>Beth<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. See you there!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是 Beth。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.<br>很多事情都会让我们感到尴尬 —— 当你的脸涨红，你希望自己能消失时，那种自我意识、不舒服的感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?<br>你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.<br>是的，很多。有一次我在停车场遇到了我的父母，我看到他们开着他们的车来了，我以一种非常愚蠢的方式挥了挥手。但不幸的是，我很快发现那不是我的父母。那是另一对。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.<br>哦，不，这真的很尴尬。我记得接电话时，我以为是我最好的朋友，我用非常愚蠢的声音说了一声“你好”，然后他们要求和我爸爸说话，但那不是我的朋友。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What was the voice?<br>声音是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Hello?<br>你好？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.<br>哦，天哪。但尴尬不仅仅是害羞和脸红。当谈到我们的健康时，有无穷无尽的事情值得尴尬。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.<br>是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?<br>所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.<br>所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.<br>还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释：</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.<br>因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.<br>许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.<br>对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>医生也可以通过多种方式提供帮助，正如 Vanessa Apea 博士在这里向 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 解释的那样：</p><p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?<br>您能告诉我们您用了什么技巧来让人们放心吗？</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.<br>我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查……我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间……所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.<br>詹姆斯问医生可以做些什么来让人们放松 —— 让他们感到平静和放松 —— Apea 医生描述了她理想的对话：这是一个安全的空间，不带评判，所说的是保密的，保密的，不与任何人分享。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?<br>是的。我问你：有多少百分比的人说他们因为尴尬而推迟去看医生，但后来被诊断出患有健康状况？你还记得你说过的话吗，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.<br>是的，我想我说的是 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.<br>恐怕这不是正确的答案。事实上，它是 a） 21% 或略高于五分之一。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的新词汇，从 delay 开始，推迟或推迟到以后。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition 的意思是通过识别症状和检查患者来识别它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.<br>如果你默默忍受，你会忍受痛苦的感觉，并在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦的感受作斗争。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.<br>短语动词 put someone at ease 的意思是让某人感到平静和放松。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.<br>形容词 confidential 的意思是保密和秘密，并描述不与其他任何人共享的信息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.</p><p>Dan<br>And I’m Dan.</p><p>Rob<br>Now, do you know who Michelle Obama is?</p><p>Dan<br>Er, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.</p><p>Rob<br>That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?</p><p>Dan <br>th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.</p><p>Rob<br>OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?</p><p>BBC News Report<br>The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.</p><p>Rob <br>So, where did she revisit on this trip?</p><p>Dan<br>She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.</p><p>Rob<br>The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.</p><p>Dan<br>One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.</p><p>Rob<br>There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.</p><p>Dan<br>I get that feeling all the time!</p><p>Rob<br>I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.</p><p>Dan<br>Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.</p><p>Rob<br>Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.</p><p>Michelle Obama<br>That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.</p><p>Rob<br>She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.</p><p>Dan<br>She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.</p><p>Rob <br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?</p><p>Dan<br>I thought it was the 20th Century.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, you were right.</p><p>Dan<br>Yay!</p><p>Rob<br>th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Dan<br>We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.</p><p>Rob<br>Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.</p><p>Dan <br>The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.</p><p>Rob<br>Next there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.</p><p>Dan<br>The next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from.</p><p>Rob<br>And finally there was the noun phrase station in life.</p><p>Dan<br>Your station in life is your position in society – your social status.</p><p>Rob<br>And that brings us to the end of this week’s programme. We’ll be back soon and in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our app and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye bye for now. </p><p>Dan<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.<br>你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 罗伯。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And I’m Dan.<br>我是 Dan。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Now, do you know who Michelle Obama is?<br>现在，你知道米歇尔·奥巴马是谁吗？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Er, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.<br>呃，是的。也许是世界上最著名的女性？前第一夫人，这意味着她是美利坚合众国总统的妻子。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?<br>这是正确的。她刚刚出版了自己的自传，并一直在英国谈论她的生活。在我们了解更多信息之前，以下是本周的问题。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪还是，c） 20 世纪，有什么想法吗？</p><p>Dan (担 )<br>th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.<br>th 这可能是一个棘手的问题。第一任美国总统是在 18 世纪，他们有妻子，但我认为实际的术语可能只是在很久以后才引入的 —— 所以我要大胆猜测一下，说 20 世纪。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?<br>还行。好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 对英国的访问进行了 BBC 新闻报道。根据这份报告，她去过哪里，而她以前去过哪里？</p><p>BBC News Report(BBC新闻报道)<br>The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.<br>这位前第一夫人公开谈论了许多问题，她的主要信息之一是关于赋权。当天早些时候，奥巴马夫人再次访问了伦敦北部的一所学校，她说，她在担任第一夫人期间第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>So, where did she revisit on this trip?<br>那么，她这次旅行重访了哪里呢？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.<br>她在伦敦北部的一所学校上学。她说，正是在这所学校，她第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。如果你受到启发去做某事，你会有一种强烈的感觉，你想做某事，你会有一种强烈的动力去实现某件事，通常是因为别人说过或取得了成就。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.<br>该报告还提到，她公开谈论了一些问题。公开谈论某事是指您讨论一个话题，通常是一个困难的话题，而不试图隐藏事实或您的感受。当人们谈论生活中他们觉得困难或尴尬的事情时，会用到这个短语。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.<br>她公开谈论的一件事是她自己觉得自己并不真正属于这里，她真的有技能或才能来做她正在做的事情，她不配得到这个职位。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.<br>它有一个名字。这被称为冒名顶替者综合症 —— 那种感觉，你认为有一天每个人都会意识到你真的不太擅长你所做的事情。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>I get that feeling all the time!<br>我一直都有这种感觉！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.<br>我想知道为什么？因为这种冒名顶替者综合症的问题在于它没有道理。这更多的是缺乏自信或社会给我们贴标签的结果。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.<br>好吧，无论如何，回到报告。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 也热衷于谈论赋权的话题。这给了人们力量、信心和力量，让他们靠自己实现他们想要的生活。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.<br>现在让我们听听米歇尔·奥巴马本人如何谈论我们有时如何根据他们的阶级而不是他们的个人能力来评判他们。</p><p>Michelle Obama(米歇尔·奥巴马)<br>That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.<br>这通常是我们犯的错误，我们假设工人阶级本身并不具有很高的天赋，而很多时候你的生活地位受到你所处环境的限制。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.<br>她在这里说，我们根据人们的社会地位或生活中的地位来假设他们的事情。假设的意思是“做出的判断不是基于事实，而是基于我们认为是真实的”。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.<br>她自己使用了这个短语。当你说某人本身就有才华时，这意味着他们的才华来自他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们碰巧与之相关的任何组织、个人或阶级有任何联系。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?<br>在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪，还是 c） 20 世纪，还有丹，你说？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>I thought it was the 20th Century.<br>我以为是 20 世纪。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, you were right.<br>嗯，你是对的。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Yay!<br>耶！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.<br>但让我说完。你是对的，那时晚于 18 世纪，而 18 世纪是第一任美国总统任职的时候，但还没有到 20 世纪。19 世纪下半叶，第一夫人的头衔开始使用。现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.<br>我们从 to open ly talk about something 这句话开始。这意味着讨论某事，通常是一个困难的话题，而不隐藏您对该主题的感受、情绪或事实。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.<br>然后是名词 empowerment。这是给人一种他们掌控自己生活的感觉的过程，使人们对自己的权利和能力更有信心。</p><p>Dan (担 )<br>The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.<br>接下来是动词 inspire。如果你激励人们，你就会给他们一种感觉，他们想做一些事情，并且可以做一些困难的事情或有创意的事情。如果你自己也有这种感觉，你就会受到启发。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Next there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.<br>接下来是动词 to assume something。To assume 的意思是“不是根据证据，而是根据你认为或相信是真实的事物来判断某人或某事”。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>The next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from.<br>下一句话本身就是他们自己的。例如，如果某人本身就成功了，这意味着他们的成功是因为他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们为谁工作、与谁一起工作或他们来自哪个社会群体。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And finally there was the noun phrase station in life.<br>最后是名词短语 station in life。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Your station in life is your position in society – your social status.<br>你的人生地位就是你在社会中的地位 —— 你的社会地位。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And that brings us to the end of this week’s programme.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>Today we’re talking about buttons.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen.</p><p>Rob<br>Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil?</p><p>Neil <br>Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.</p><p>Rob <br>OK. What does he say about children and buttons?</p><p>Neil<br>That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.</p><p>Neil<br>But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.</p><p>Rob<br>Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.</p><p>Rob<br>So then, why can’t we resist buttons?</p><p>Neil<br>Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.</p><p>Rob<br>The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?</p><p>Neil<br>No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.</p><p>Rob<br>And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.</p><p>Rob <br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?</p><p>Neil<br>I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.</p><p>Rob<br>That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.</p><p>Rob<br>Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.</p><p>Neil <br>And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.</p><p>Rob<br>Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.</p><p>Neil<br>The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.</p><p>Rob<br>And finally we had grooming.</p><p>Neil<br>This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.</p><p>Rob<br>Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now. </p><p>Neil <br>Bye!

It’s a hard one.<br>呃 – 我想我害怕发音这些词！不知道答案是什么，我认为纽扣恐惧症太明显了 —— 所以它是其他问题之一 —— 或者是吗？这是一个艰难的问题。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?<br>好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。Thinking Allowed 是 BBC Radio 4 的一档节目，涵盖了一系列有趣的话题。最近，他们讨论了纽扣以及它们对日常生活的重要性。剑桥大学英语教授 Steven Connor 参加了该节目，他谈到了纽扣的吸引力。关于子项和按钮，怎么说？</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.<br>我们确实喜欢纽扣，我认为纽扣的乐趣和诱惑……这种诱惑，每个人都能感受到，这就是为什么按钮必须非常方便。另一方面，它们必须远离儿童，所以它们必须放在墙上的高处，真正重要的按钮必须非常难以按下 —— 比如放在玻璃后面或其他东西。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>OK. What does he say about children and buttons?<br>还行。他对孩子和纽扣有什么看法？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.<br>他们必须远离他们！正如我之前所说，我小时候就喜欢按下按钮。我会按我看到的任何东西，所以重要的肯定是我够不着的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.<br>是的，他说纽扣是一种诱惑。诱惑是让你想做某事的东西，它经常被用来做你真的不应该做的事情。因此，导致潜在危险或严重后果的按钮（如火灾警报器）需要受到保护，也许是在玻璃后面，这样诱惑就不会战胜我们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.<br>但是许多按钮在日常生活中都有有用的实用用途，例如呼叫电梯 - 因此这些按钮必须易于使用且没有困难。这个形容词很方便。这些日常按钮必须方便。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?<br>Connor 教授继续详细介绍了纽扣为何如此吸引人。他怎么看？</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.<br>你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So then, why can’t we resist buttons?<br>那么，为什么我们不能抗拒纽扣呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.<br>因为作为人类，我们有一种坐立不安的本能。我们不能长时间静止不动，我们需要经常四处走动，因为我们是非常数字化的生物。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?<br>不过，数字的使用与现代在线技术无关，不是吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.<br>不，手指是手指或脚趾。所以我们是数字生物 – 我们有手指，我们喜欢使用它们。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.<br>其他数字生物（如猿类）所做的一件事是梳理毛发。也就是说，他们用手清洁其他猿类的体毛。他们通过毛发寻找昆虫和虫子，然后把它们拉出来吃掉。但我们也可以用 grooming 这个词来形容人类，例如，一个整洁、干净、得体的人。又是康纳教授。</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.<br>你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?<br>在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。有些人害怕纽扣，这是一种公认的恐惧症，但它叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，还有 Neil，你说的？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.<br>我没有，但我不认为这可能是 “纽扣恐惧症”，那太容易了。我认为 coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧，所以我选择了另一个 - koumpounophobia。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.<br>没错。Buttonophobia 是一个虚构的词，正如你所说，coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧。好，现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.<br>我们一直在谈论按钮。这些可以是我们用来固定衣服的小圆件，也可以是我们推动某事发生的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.<br>按钮可能是一种诱惑。我们看到一个，我们想推动它。所以诱惑是让我们想要做一些我们知道不应该做的事情。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.<br>然后我们有了形容词 方便。方便的东西很容易使用。例如，呼叫电梯的按钮位于非常方便的高度，可以很容易地触及。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.<br>康纳教授接着谈到了我们坐立不安的本能。作为人类，我们喜欢坐立不安，我们喜欢四处走动，我们不能长时间保持静止，我们喜欢用手做事。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.<br>教授谈到我们是数字生物，这意味着有手指的生物 —— 数字是手指或脚趾的另一种说法。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And finally we had grooming.<br>最后我们进行了梳理。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.<br>这是通过清洁、洗头和做头发来让自己看起来漂亮的习惯。这是一些动物（例如猿类）为彼此做的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>What do you remember of your teenage years?</p><p>Rob<br>Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.</p><p>Rob<br>So whose fault is it?</p><p>Neil<br>Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?</p><p>Rob <br>Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.</p><p>Neil<br>I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore<br>The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.</p><p>Neil <br>So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?</p><p>Rob<br>Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.</p><p>Neil<br>And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?</p><p>Rob<br>No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.</p><p>Neil<br>What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.</p><p>Neil<br>So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore<br>The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.</p><p>Neil<br>So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.</p><p>Neil<br>So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!</p><p>Rob<br>Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?</p><p>Rob<br>I guessed c) 1950s</p><p>Neil<br>The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Rob<br>Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period.</p><p>Neil<br>So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence.</p><p>Rob <br>Exactly.</p><p>Neil<br>Papers is the word for published scientific research.</p><p>Rob<br>Dogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged.</p><p>Neil<br>The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks.</p><p>Rob<br>And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions.</p><p>Neil<br>Well my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, your skills are working well Neil. We may be going now but you don’t need to – you can listen or watch us again and find lots more learning English materials on our social media platforms. You can also visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>See you soon, goodbye. </p><p>Rob <br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What do you remember of your teenage years?<br>你还记得你的青少年时代吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?<br>哦，我简直是一场噩梦。我对父母很粗鲁，总是在外面呆到很晚，从不做作业，和错误的人一起出去玩，做了很多错误的决定。你呢，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.<br>嗯，真的差不多。人们总是这样说青少年，不是吗？他们经历了一段失控和行为不端的时期。但显然，这不是他们的错。至少不是直接的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So whose fault is it?<br>那么是谁的错呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?<br>显然是我们的大脑。青少年的大脑仍在控制行为的区域发育，这可能意味着你不能责怪他们的行为方式。在我们了解更多信息之前，让我们先提出我们的问题。一直都有青少年，但“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的呢？是： a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 有什么想法吗，罗伯？</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.<br>嗯，我认为它大约出现在摇滚乐时代，所以那应该是 1950 年代。这是我的猜测。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?<br>我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。来自伦敦大学学院的 Sarah-Jayne Blakemore 专门研究大脑的运作，尤其是青少年的大脑。最近，她是 BBC 广播节目 The Life Scientific 的嘉宾。她解释说，关于大脑在青少年时期仍在发育的理解是相当新的。她说第一项研究是什么时候出来的？</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)<br>The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.<br>第一项研究表明，人脑在整个青春期和 20 多岁都经历了这种非常实质性和显着的发展；第一批论文发表于 90 年代后期。在此之前，例如当我上大学时，教科书中的教条是，绝大多数大脑发育发生在生命的最初几年，童年中期之后就没有什么太大的变化了。这个教条是完全错误的。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?<br>那么，对青少年大脑的研究是什么时候出来的呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.<br>令人惊讶的是，直到 1990 年代后期才出现。就在这时，她说关于这个主题的第一批论文发表了。在这种情况下，论文是指已发表的科学研究成果。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?<br>她实际上并没有谈论青少年，对吧？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.<br>不，没错。她谈到了青春期。这个名词，青春期，是一个人从儿童发展成成人的时期，它或多或少与青少年时期相同。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.<br>我发现有趣的是，在 1990 年代之前，人们认为我们的大脑发育方式有所不同。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.<br>是的，布莱克莫尔教授说，当时的教条是，我们的大脑大多在儿童早期就已经完全发育，早在青春期之前。教条是一个词，用于描述人们被期望接受为真理的强烈信念。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?<br>因此，我们的大脑发育仍然比最初认为的要晚得多。这告诉我们关于青少年行为的什么信息？特别令人感兴趣的是大脑的一个重要部分，称为前额叶皮层。布莱克莫尔教授又来了。她能给那些没有按时完成作业的青少年找什么借口呢？</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)<br>The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.<br>前额叶皮层是大脑中位于前额正后方的部分，它参与了一系列非常高级的认知任务，例如决策和规划 —— 我们知道这个区域在青少年时期正在经历非常非常大量的发育。因此，就我们对青少年的期望而言，例如，计划他们的家庭作业，考虑到我们知道大脑中关键参与计划的区域还没有发育，这可能太高了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?<br>所以前额叶皮层在认知任务中很重要。那些是什么，罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.<br>认知任务是需要有意识地思考和处理的任务，例如做出决策和规划。它不会自动发生，您必须考虑它。所以在青少年时期，大脑的这一部分还没有完全发育。请注意我们早期青春期的名词的形容词形式。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!<br>所以这给了你不做功课的好借口！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.<br>哈，哈，我真希望我早就知道了。我曾经说我把作业忘在了公共汽车上，或者狗吃了它。现在我可以说，’对不起，先生，我的大脑还不够发达，无法完成计划家庭作业的认知任务’。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?<br>是的，我确定那会奏效！在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。我问“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的人？你说是：a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I guessed c) 1950s<br>我猜 c） 1950 年代</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary.<br>答案实际上是 b） 1930 年代。如果你知道这一点，那就太好了。现在快速回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period.<br>青春期是从儿童到成人变化时期的名词，形容词是青少年 —— 同一个词也是处于那个青少年时期的人的名词。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence.<br>因此，青少年可能要对他或她的青春期行为负责。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Exactly.<br>完全。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Papers is the word for published scientific research.<br>Papers 是已发表的科学研究的词。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Dogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged.<br>教条是坚定不移的信念，不受挑战。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks.<br>前额叶皮层是大脑中处理认知任务的重要组成部分。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions.<br>认知任务是需要积极思考和考虑的心理过程，例如计划和做出决定。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish.<br>好吧，我的决策能力告诉我，是时候完成了。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, your skills are working well Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>We’re going to be looking at a letter from the English alphabet. It’s a letter which has a particular meaning when used at the end of a piece of informal writing such as letters, emails, texts and messages.</p><p>Rob<br>I’m very EXcited.</p><p>Neil<br>Ha ha, very good, very good Rob!</p><p>Rob<br>My EXpectations are really high.</p><p>Neil<br>Yep, that’s another good one.</p><p>Rob<br>Is it an EXtraordinary letter?</p><p>Neil<br>OK, thank you Rob, that’s enough of your jokes. I’m getting EXasperated! Oh, now you’ve got me at it! Well, no prizes for guessing what letter we’re focussing on today?</p><p>Rob <br>Why?</p><p>Neil<br>No, it’s not Y.</p><p>Rob <br>No, no. I didn’t mean the letter ‘y’, I meant the word ‘why’, as in - why are there no prizes?</p><p>Neil<br>Because of all the not so subtle clues you’ve been giving. The letter is X.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes. Exactly.</p><p>Neil<br>Alright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let’s have a question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? Any ideas Rob?</p><p>Rob <br>An excellent question but quite obscure, I’m going to say b) Hindi.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, I’ll have the answer later on. Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.</p><p>Neil<br>Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from?</p><p>Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge <br>Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans…</p><p>Presenter:<br>That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there.</p><p>Presenter:<br>It has, clunk.</p><p>Neil <br>What do we learn about the origins of the X for kisses?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, it’s been used since at least 1763 and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks.</p><p>Neil<br>And why did this come to mean a kiss?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, Dr Wright suggests it’s because of the original pronunciation - &#x2F;ks&#x2F;.</p><p>Neil<br>And at the point the presenter made the connection, didn’t he?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he did. And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped.</p><p>Neil<br>And this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk.</p><p>Rob<br>Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example.</p><p>Neil<br>Let’s listen to that exchange again.</p><p>Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge <br>Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763.

I think a penny’s just dropped there.</p><p>Presenter:<br>It has, clunk.</p><p>Neil<br>One thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something you do for everyone. It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?</p><p>Professor Nils Langer, University of Bristol<br>A colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs.</p><p>Presenter:<br>They docked her another 20 quid, I think!</p><p>Neil<br>What was her mistake, Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>She didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax.</p><p>Neil<br>We don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound.</p><p>Neil <br>Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian?</p><p>Rob<br>I guessed b) Hindi.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme.</p><p>Rob<br>We started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something</p><p>Rob <br>A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other.</p><p>Neil<br>The Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority.</p><p>Rob<br>If you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it’s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, goodbye. </p><p>Rob <br>Bye bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello.

Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?<br>好吧，我稍后会给出答案。现在，罗伯，消息末尾的字母 X 本身是什么意思？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.<br>嗯，意思是一个吻。亲吻越多，你表现出的爱意就越多。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from?

And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped.<br>是的，他做到了。Wright博士用了一个短语来形容某人突然理解了某件事，特别是对其他人来说很明显的事情。她说，一分钱刚刚掉了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere.

I think a penny’s just dropped there.<br>这几乎是一个吻，不是吗？是的，不是吗？我想那里只是掉了一分钱。</p><p>Presenter:(主持人：)<br>It has, clunk.<br>它有，笨拙。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>One thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something you do for everyone. It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?<br>在通信末尾放置 X 需要注意的一点是，它不是你为所有人做的事情。它通常只对朋友和家人，你在现实生活中可能会亲吻的人。布里斯托大学的 Nils Langer 教授讲述了一个关于他的一位同事的故事，这位同事对这个惯例不太熟悉。她犯了什么错误？</p><p>Professor Nils Langer, University of Bristol(NilsLanger教授，布里斯托大学)<br>A colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs.<br>我一个来自布里斯托尔的同事，当她从德国过来时，她认为 X 只是在英国结束一封信的正常方式，因此她会用 X 结束任何一封信，甚至是一封给税务局的信。我们从未真正听说过税务局如何用这些 X 来回应这些信件。</p><p>Presenter:(主持人：)<br>They docked her another 20 quid, I think!<br>我想，他们又给她停了 20 英镑！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What was her mistake, Rob?<br>她犯了什么错误，罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>She didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax.<br>她没有意识到你不会在每一次通信上都打 X。因此，她甚至将其写在商业信函上，包括一封给英国税务局的政府部门。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been.<br>我们不知道税务人员对这封带有亲吻的信有何感想。但主持人开玩笑说他们的反应会是什么。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound.<br>是的，他开玩笑说他们可能又给她停了 20 英镑。To dock money 是减少您期望收到的金额，而 quid 是英镑的俚语。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian?<br>现在是我们问题的答案了。英语有 26 个字母。哪种语言有 74 个字母？是吗。。。a） 高棉语（柬埔寨语） b） 印地语或 c） 亚美尼亚语？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I guessed b) Hindi.<br>我猜 b） 印地语。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme.<br>嗯，我想这是三分之一的机会，但这次不是正确的。答案是 a） 高棉语。如果你知道这一点，那就太好了。现在让我们来看看这个节目中我们看的词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>We started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling.<br>我们从 penny 开始。一便士是一枚英国硬币。一百便士等于一英镑。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something<br>短语 the penny has dropped，意思是某人突然明白了某事</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other.<br>咔嚓声是两个重物相互撞击的声音。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority.<br>Inland Revenue 是英国的税务机关。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>If you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary.<br>如果您从某人那里收取资金，则会减少您支付给他们的金额。例如，作为英国的员工，您的税款会自动从您的工资中扣除。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it’s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, goodbye. <br>最后是 quid，这是一英镑的俚语。好了，在他们开始扣我们迟到的工资之前，是时候说再见了。在 Instagram、Facebook、Twitter、YouTube 上找到我们，我们的应用程序，当然还有 bbclearningenglish.com 的网站。再见，再见。 </p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Bye bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="a-penny"><a href="#a-penny" class="headerlink" title="a penny"></a>a penny</h4><p>a coin (100 pennies &#x3D; 1.00 GBP)<br>一分钱<br>a coin (100 pennies &#x3D; 1.00 GBP) 一枚硬币（100便士&#x3D;1.00英镑）<br>He didn’t have a penny to his name.<br>他身无分文。</p><h4 id="clunk"><a href="#clunk" class="headerlink" title="clunk"></a>clunk</h4><p>the noise of two heavy objects coming together<br>当啷声<br>the noise of two heavy objects coming together 两个沉重的物体撞击在一起的声音<br>The heavy box clunked to the ground.<br>沉重的箱子当啷一声掉到了地上。</p><h4 id="Inland-Revenue"><a href="#Inland-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Inland Revenue"></a>Inland Revenue</h4><p>the government department in the UK which deals with taxes<br>英国税务海关总署<br>the government department in the UK which deals with taxes 英国负责税收的政府部门<br>He owed a considerable sum to the Inland Revenue.<br>他欠税务海关总署一大笔钱。</p><h4 id="to-dock"><a href="#to-dock" class="headerlink" title="to dock"></a>to dock</h4><p>to reduce the amount of money someone receives in their salary or wages, for example as a tax payment<br>扣除<br>to reduce the amount of money someone receives in their salary or wages, for example as a tax payment 从某人的薪水或工资中扣除一部分钱，例如作为税款支付<br>His wages were docked for lateness.<br>他因迟到而被扣工资。</p><h4 id="a-quid"><a href="#a-quid" class="headerlink" title="a quid"></a>a quid</h4><p>slang term for 1.00 GBP<br>一英镑<br>slang term for 1.00 GBP 一英镑（俚语）<br>It cost me a quid.<br>这花了我一英镑。</p><h4 id="the-penny-has-dropped"><a href="#the-penny-has-dropped" class="headerlink" title="the penny has dropped"></a>the penny has dropped</h4><p>someone suddenly realises or understands something<br>恍然大悟<br>someone suddenly realises or understands something 某人突然意识到或理解某事<br>The penny dropped when I realised what he was saying.<br>当我意识到他在说什么时，我恍然大悟。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>
