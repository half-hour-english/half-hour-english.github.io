This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Pippa.</p><p>Georgie<br>And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?</p><p>Pippa<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?</p><p>Georgie<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.</p><p>Pippa<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650</p><p>Georgie<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.</p><p>Georgie<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.</p><p>Alicia Weston<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.</p><p>Pippa<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.</p><p>Georgie<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.</p><p>Pippa<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.</p><p>Amy, mentor<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]</p><p>Ally<br>Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.</p><p>Georgia<br>I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.</p><p>Ally<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.</p><p>Georgie<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.</p><p>Pippa<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.</p><p>Georgie<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!</p><p>Pippa<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.</p><p>Georgie<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.</p><p>Georgie<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.</p><p>Pippa<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.</p><p>Georgie<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.</p><p>Pippa<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.</p><p>Georgie<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.</p><p>Pippa<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!</p><p>Georgie<br>Oh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website.

In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?<br>我是 Georgie。在这个计划中，我们谈论的是节省食物费用。Pippa，你擅长在食品店省钱吗？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?<br>我觉得我挺好的。我计划我喜欢做什么，这样我就不会在超市浪费钱。你呢，Georgie？</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.<br>我不是很好。我通常在饿的时候去超市，所以我最终买了很多零食。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650<br>哦，这真是个糟糕的主意。好吧，在这个计划中，我们将学习一种在我们吃的食物上省钱的方法。但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Georgie。世界上最昂贵的餐厅被认为是伊维萨岛一家名为 Sublimotion 的餐厅，每晚只有 12 名顾客。但是，在餐厅每人吃一顿饭要多少欧元呢？a） 650 欧元 b） 1,650 欧元 c） 2,650 欧元</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.<br>最昂贵的…我选择 c） 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，英国的食品越来越贵，就像在世界许多地方一样，有些人正在努力负担食品购物的费用。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.<br>但 BBC 世界服务节目 People Fixing the World 一直在了解一个名为“Bags of Taste”的项目，该项目帮助人们节省购买食品的费用，同时改善他们的饮食。Bags of something 是一种非正式的方式，可以表达很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.<br>Bags of Taste 的创始人 Alicia Weston 开始担心，在英国，钱少的人发现很难负担得起健康的饮食。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.<br>贫困人口的饮食习惯最差，而且他们的年龄越来越大。我们知道，饮食是英国健康不平等的最大原因。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.<br>Alicia 发现人们不知道如何烹饪他们想吃的饭菜，而且他们负担不起实验的费用。想象一下，在食材上花了很多钱，然后通过煮得不好或烧焦食物来浪费它们。人们还认为制作健康食品太昂贵且花费太多时间。</p><p>Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)<br>So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.<br>因此，最终，我们能够提出一个基本上可以解决所有这些问题的计划。所以我们现在做的是将所有原料送到他们家门口，因为归根结底，行为改变始于真正改变你在家里的行为。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.<br>Alicia 说，最终，她已经能够想出一个解决方案来帮助人们在健康食品上省钱。我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally，在一系列事件发生之后。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.<br>Alicia 希望解决阻碍人们在预算内吃健康食品的问题。如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它。Alicia 的解决方案包括将食材和食谱交付给人们，然后使用 WhatsApp 群组与参与者交谈。每个 WhatsApp 群组都有一位导师，他会分享烹饪技巧和建议。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.<br>为了让您了解其运作方式，People Fixing the World 的团队在其中一个 “Bags of Taste” WhatsApp 聊天中朗读了一些消息。</p><p>Amy, mentor(Amy，导师)<br>Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way.

Looking forward to it.<br>我明天要煮我的。期待它。</p><p>Ally(盟友)<br>I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.<br>我已经完成了我的 chana masala。我对辣椒有点太重了。我丈夫喜欢很多香料。所以，下次我会减少这个数字。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.<br>该小组的导师 Amy 将 chana masala 的食谱描述为经典之作。我们称某物为经典，以表示它是众所周知的且质量好。我们也可以将特定的书籍、电影或歌曲描述为经典。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.<br>Amy 发送了一段视频，展示了一种切洋葱的技术，她将其描述为切洋葱很痛苦。如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那就很难做或令人讨厌。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!<br>其中一位参与者 Ally 说，当她制作 chana masala 时，她对辣椒有点粗暴。如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多，所以 Ally 的 chana masala 非常辣！</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.<br>Bags of Taste 帮助人们学习新食谱并烹饪健康食品，而无需花太多钱。在我的问题中，这肯定比在餐厅吃饭便宜得多，Georgie。我问你，在被认为是世界上最昂贵的餐厅 Sublimotion 吃一顿饭要多少钱。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.<br>是的，我说一顿饭是 2,650 欧元。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.<br>好吧，你错了。它实际上是 1,650 欧元，但我认为这仍然相当昂贵。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.<br>绝对是。还行。让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 bags of 开始，这意味着很多东西。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.<br>我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally， after a series of events。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.<br>如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它并找到解决方案。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.<br>如果我们将某样东西（比如食谱）描述为经典，我们的意思是它是众所周知的并且质量好。</p><p>Georgie(乔治)<br>If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.<br>如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那么它就是烦人或难以做到的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?</p><p>Neil<br>Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.</p><p>Beth<br>Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.</p><p>Neil<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.</p><p>Beth<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.</p><p>Neil<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.</p><p>Beth<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.</p><p>Neil<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.</p><p>Ruth Alexander<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.</p><p>Neil<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment.

Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?<br>我是贝丝。Neil，您经常吃什么类型的食物？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.<br>嗯，让我吃饱的基本东西 —— 那种面包、土豆。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.<br>嗯，像这样很多人经常吃的食物，被称为主食。在英国，面包是一种流行的主食，但对于世界大部分地区来说，还有另一种食物是第一大食物：米饭。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.<br>没错。世界上超过一半的人口以大米为主食，尤其是在亚洲。但水稻是一种非常“缺水”的作物，需要大量的水才能生长，由于气候变化造成的干旱和洪水，这正在成为一个问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>在本节目中，我们将听到一项开创性的新技术，该技术帮助农民在面对不断变化的气候时种植水稻。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到该程序的所有词汇，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。刚才我提到水稻是一种非常“口渴”的作物 —— 那么种植一公斤水需要多少水呢？是：a） 1,000 到 3,000 升吗？b） 3,000 至 5,000 升？或者，c） 5,000 至 7,000 升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.<br>我要说的是 c） 5,000 到 7,000 升。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。Yvonne Pinto 博士是位于菲律宾的国际水稻研究所（简称 IRRI）的总干事。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》解释了更多关于大米在全球流行的情况：</p><p>Dr Yvonne Pinto(YvonnePinto医师)<br>Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.<br>世界上 50% 到 56% 的人口以大米为主要主食。现在，大约有 40 亿人，它是真正广泛种植的商品之一，尤其是在南亚和东南亚。但在非洲等大陆，人们对它的需求越来越大，当然也有拉丁美洲和欧洲的大米品种。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.<br>大米是一种商品，一种可以买卖的产品。与其他作物一样，大米也有多种类型，例如糙米、长粒米或印度樟米。今天对水稻的大部分研究都集中在培育能够适应不断变化的环境并在水过多或过少的条件下生长的新品种。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.<br>世界上超过一半的人口吃大米，非洲和欧洲的需求也在不断增长，因此很明显，全世界对大米都有胃口和强烈的愿望。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.<br>那么，是否有可能以更环保的方式种植水稻呢？大米公司 Tilda 的董事 Jean-Philippe Laborde 认为，答案在于一种称为交替湿式干燥（简称 AWD）的新种植技术。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:<br>为了种植水稻，农民会经历淹没田地或稻田的循环，然后稻田干涸，需要再次被淹没。使用 AWD 时，测量管被放置在地下 15 厘米处，以便农民可以检查田地任何部分的水位。通常，水稻需要 25 次洪水和干燥循环才能生长，但使用 AWD 可以减少到 20 次循环，从而为农民节省用水并减少甲烷排放。这是让-菲利普·拉博德 （Jean-Philippe Laborde） 告诉 BBC 国际频道《食物链》的主持人露丝·亚历山大 （Ruth Alexander） 他是如何开始对印度农民进行 AWD 实验的：</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.<br>去年，我们有 1,268 名农民应用了这种 AWD 技术来减少甲烷总排放量。</p><p>Ruth Alexander(露丝·亚历山大)<br>And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?<br>您是如何说服那些农民试一试的？</p><p>Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)<br>That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.<br>这相当具有挑战性，因为显然，对于农民来说，主要挑战是担心失去收入。他们需要在作物结束时看到切实的结果……他们显然得到了更好的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.<br>许多印度农民都加入了让-菲利普的实验。如果您参与某事，即表示您同意行动计划并参与其中。换句话说，你试一试 – 你尝试做一些事情，看看它是否有效。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?<br>事实证明，新技术产生了切实的结果，结果是真实且可衡量的。使用 AWD，种植水稻所需的水和电量减少，甲烷气体排放量减少，最重要的是，水稻产量增加……对，Neil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.<br>我问种植 1 公斤水需要多少升水，答案是 3,000 到 5,000 升水，非常口渴，但并不像你想象的那么口渴。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从商品开始，一种可以买卖的产品，比如大米。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Varieties of something are different types of it.<br>某物的种类是它的不同类型的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.<br>如果对某样东西有胃口，就会有强烈的愿望或需求。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.<br>如果你同意一个想法或计划，你就同意做某事并参与其中。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To give it a go means to try doing something.<br>To give it a go 的意思是尝试做某事。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>It makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m not surprised. That sounds great.</p><p>Pippa<br>So, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?</p><p>Pippa<br>I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.</p><p>Pippa<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.</p><p>Neil<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.</p><p>Pippa<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.</p><p>Pippa<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.</p><p>Neil<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Charmaine Cozier<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.</p><p>Pippa<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.</p><p>Neil<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?</p><p>Pippa<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.</p><p>Pippa<br>Nice.</p><p>Neil<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.</p><p>Pippa<br>A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.</p><p>Neil<br>The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.</p><p>Pippa<br>If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.</p><p>Neil<br>A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.</p><p>Pippa<br>And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.<br>好的，让我们看看您是否在节目结束时。现在，简而言之，国民幸福总值意味着通过可持续和生态友好型发展来保护不丹的自然环境和文化。不丹政府认为这些目标比不惜一切代价发展经济更重要。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>多年来，不丹一直与外界隔绝 —— 第一批外国游客于 1974 年抵达，而电视直到 1999 年才被引入。不丹国王希望使国家现代化，并赋予其现代技术的好处，但又不损害传统文化，因此他邀请外部专家来发展国民幸福总值的想法。其中一位专家是 Ha Vinh Tho 博士，他在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 的主持人 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈：</p><p>Dr Ha Vinh Tho(HaVinhTho医师)<br>So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.<br>所以，他的想法是：’我们如何在不失去文化、环境和强大的社会结构的情况下实现国家的现代化和开放？因为不丹是亚洲唯一从未被殖民的国家之一，所以它的文化非常完整和充满活力，主要是佛教文化。因此，我们的想法是，国民幸福总值应该是所有政府决策和政策的重点。</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.<br>因此，公民的福祉和幸福成为中心议题。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.<br>不丹拥有强大的社会结构，这意味着社区内部有良好的关系，这些关系将社会团结在一起。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.<br>与其他亚洲国家不同，不丹从未被殖民，因此其佛教文化和传统完好无损 —— 它们是完整且未受破坏的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.<br>因此，不丹人民的幸福成为中心，它成为最重要的事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.<br>不丹对幸福的重视受到了全世界的钦佩，但也存在问题。一个是不丹工人迁移到印度和其他国家，以寻找收入更高的工作和机会，这就是所谓的人才流失。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.<br>因此，在 2023 年，不丹国王宣布了一项耗资数百万美元的项目，名为“正念之城”，这是一座基于精神和环境原则建造的新喜马拉雅城市，全部由可再生能源提供动力。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>来自不丹的 Lhawang Ugyel 博士是该项目的主任，他与 BBC 国际频道的 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈， 调查.</p><p>Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)<br>The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.<br>该项目还旨在扭转不丹的人才流失。</p><p>Dr Lhawang Ugyel(LhawangUgyel医生)<br>The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.<br>目的是让当地人管理整个正念城市，所以从这个意义上说，这也是为了吸引已经离开的移民，他们在国外工作，获得了额外的技能，回到正念城市工作。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.<br>除了是一个未来主义的生态城市外，正念之城还希望通过吸引工人回到不丹来阻止不丹的人才流失。然后，这些当地工人可以通过提升技能来使用他们在国外学到的额外技能。技能提升是通过培训提高工人技能的过程。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.<br>国民幸福总值的概念听起来可能很不寻常，但看到不丹平衡经济增长和人民幸福感是很有趣的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…<br>是的，这是真的 —— 这让我想起了你的问题，尼尔……</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?<br>是的，我问你国际幸福日的日期是哪一天？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.<br>我说那是英国夏天的 6 月 20 日。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.<br>嗯，也许这对南半球的人们更好，因为现在是 3 月 20 日。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Nice.<br>好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.<br>如果您答对了，为什么不试试我们的互动测验，您可以在我们的网站上找到 bbclearningenglish.com！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 modernize 开始，让一些东西更现代，例如通过引入技术。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.<br>一个国家的社会结构是指将一个社区联系在一起的关系。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.<br>形容词 intact 的意思是完整和未损坏。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.<br>如果某件事占据中心位置，它就变得比其他任何事情都重要。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.<br>当大量受过教育和技能娴熟的人离开自己的国家到另一个可以赚更多钱的国家生活和工作时，就会发生人才流失。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!<br>最后，技能提升意味着通过培训和经验来提高工人的技能。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_001.png" class="" title="snapshot_001.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_002.png" class="" title="snapshot_002.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_003.png" class="" title="snapshot_003.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_004.png" class="" title="snapshot_004.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_005.png" class="" title="snapshot_005.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_006.png" class="" title="snapshot_006.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_007.png" class="" title="snapshot_007.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_008.png" class="" title="snapshot_008.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_009.png" class="" title="snapshot_009.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_010.png" class="" title="snapshot_010.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_011.png" class="" title="snapshot_011.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_012.png" class="" title="snapshot_012.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_013.png" class="" title="snapshot_013.png"><img src="/2025/03/06/wechat-2025-03-06/snapshot_014.png" class="" title="snapshot_014.png"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="modernise"><a href="#modernise" class="headerlink" title="modernise"></a>modernise</h4><p>make more modern, for example through introducing new technology<br>现代化<br>使现代化，例如通过引进新技术<br>The government invested heavily to modernise the country’s transport infrastructure.<br>政府投入巨资来实现该国交通基础设施的现代化。</p><h4 id="social-fabric"><a href="#social-fabric" class="headerlink" title="social fabric"></a>social fabric</h4><p>community relationships which connect members of a society<br>社会结构<br>连接社会成员的社群关系<br>Immigration can weaken the social fabric of a community.<br>移民会削弱社区的社会结构。</p><h4 id="intact"><a href="#intact" class="headerlink" title="intact"></a>intact</h4><p>complete and untouched<br>完好无损<br>完整且未被触及<br>The church was destroyed during the war, but the altar somehow remained intact.<br>教堂在战争中被摧毁，但祭坛不知何故完好无损。</p><h4 id="take-centre-stage"><a href="#take-centre-stage" class="headerlink" title="take centre stage"></a>take centre stage</h4><p>become more important than anything else<br>成为焦点<br>变得比任何事情都重要<br>The issue of climate change is likely to take centre stage in the upcoming summit.<br>气候变化问题很可能在即将举行的峰会上成为焦点。</p><h4 id="brain-drain"><a href="#brain-drain" class="headerlink" title="brain drain"></a>brain drain</h4><p>when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work abroad where they can earn more money<br>人才流失<br>大量受过良好教育和拥有技能的人离开自己的国家，到国外生活和工作，在那里他们可以赚到更多的钱<br>The country is suffering a serious brain drain.<br>这个国家正遭受严重的人才流失。</p><h4 id="upskilling"><a href="#upskilling" class="headerlink" title="upskilling"></a>upskilling</h4><p>improving workers’ skills by giving them additional training<br>技能提升<br>通过提供额外的培训来提高工人的技能<br>The company invests heavily in upskilling its workforce.<br>该公司在提升员工技能方面投入巨资。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.</p><p>Neil<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.</p><p>Beth<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to say polio.</p><p>Neil<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.</p><p>Beth<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.</p><p>Neil<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.</p><p>Beth<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.</p><p>Neil<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.</p><p>Beth<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.</p><p>Neil<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.</p><p>Beth<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?</p><p>Beth<br>And I said polio. Was I right?</p><p>Neil<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.</p><p>Beth<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.</p><p>Beth<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.</p><p>Neil<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon. Bye for now!</p><p>Neil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.<br>我是贝丝。在我们的一生中，每 5 人中就有 1 人会受到癌症的影响，癌症是一种细胞不受控制地生长并导致体内肿瘤的疾病。肿瘤可以是良性的，即非癌性，也可以是恶性的，即癌性，到 2022 年，全球估计有 970 万人死于恶性癌症。但在这个节目中，我们将专注于一些好消息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.<br>疫苗是通过使人体免受某种疾病的免疫来保护人体的药物。现在，在开发一种名为 mRNA 的新疫苗方面，出现了一个突然而重要的发现 —— 一个突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>那么，癌症疫苗会很快成为现实吗？这就是我们将要发现的，以及学习一些有用的新单词和短语。请记住，如果您喜欢听六分钟英语并想同时阅读，您可以在我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com 上找到该节目的文字记录。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?<br>现在我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。我们已经提到了一些最新的疫苗，但第一个成功的疫苗治疗了哪种疾病？是：a） 流感？b） 脊髓灰质炎？或 c） 天花？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to say polio.<br>我要说的是小儿麻痹症。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:<br>还行！好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。您可能想知道为什么身体的免疫系统不自动对抗癌症。原因是癌症有巧妙的方式躲避我们的自然防御，正如田纳西州肿瘤学研究主任 Meredith McKean 博士向 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 解释的那样：</p><p>Dr Meredith McKean(MeredithMcKean博士)<br>There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.<br>有许多研究表明，癌症已经开发出不同的技术，能够发出信号或蛋白质，本质上是在癌细胞的表面，告诉免疫系统，’走开！这里没什么可看的！因此，它实际上是劫持了这些受体，基本上是告诉免疫系统放松刹车，在对抗癌症方面更加积极。这确实让免疫疗法在过去十年中取得了突破。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.<br>McKean 博士说，许多研究已经证明了癌症是如何扩散的。她使用短语 a number of 来表示几个，但这也使她的说法更有说服力，因为当然，几项研究总比一项好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.<br>癌细胞通过假装是健康细胞来关闭免疫系统。就好像他们在说 Nothing to see here！– 一个非正式的短语，可以用来鼓励人们以俏皮的方式移动或移开某物，或者掩盖某物。例如，犯罪现场的警察可能会说，“这里没什么可看的！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.<br>所以，换句话说，癌症劫持了健康的细胞 —— 它控制了不属于它的东西，并利用它为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:<br>那么，疫苗将如何改变现状呢？好吧，现有的治疗方法，如化疗，积极地针对癌症，但也攻击健康组织，产生令人不快的副作用。另一方面，新的突破性疫苗重新训练免疫系统识别癌细胞并自然地消除这些细胞 —— 即使是已经患有这种疾病的患者。以下是德克萨斯州安德森癌症中心的爱德华多·桑切斯 （Eduardo Sanchez） 教授向 BBC 国际频道的 The Inquiry 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Prof Eduardo Sanchez(EduardoSanchez教授)<br>Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.<br>基本上，癌细胞在告诉免疫系统，’不要攻击我，不要吃我’，对吧？免疫系统已经忘记了如何识别这些癌细胞，对识别癌细胞产生的那些畸变变得盲目，我们想用疫苗做的是重新教育免疫系统。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.<br>在癌症患者中，免疫系统对癌变的生长视而不见 —— 它完全没有注意到它们或意识到它们的危险，因此疫苗以不同的方式重新教育免疫系统或教它行为。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.<br>回顾一下，一些癌症治疗通过疏通我们受阻的自然防御来起作用，而疫苗则重新训练免疫系统以自然地发现和攻击癌细胞。由于这两种方法完全不同，因此它们可以一起使用，也可以单独使用。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?<br>所以，回答我最初的问题，Neil，癌症疫苗可能并不遥远。但是你的问题怎么样 —— 现在是不是该透露答案了？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?<br>我问哪种疾病首先被疫苗成功治疗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I said polio. Was I right?<br>我说的是小儿麻痹症。我是对的吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.<br>恐怕你错了。正确的选项是 C，即天花。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从突破开始，一个突然的、戏剧性的和重要的发现。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.<br>许多事物意味着几个或许多，可以增加你所说的可信度。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.<br>短语 Nothing to see here！用于阻止人们注意或过于仔细地观察某物，或将他们移开。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.<br>如果你劫持了什么东西，你就利用了不属于你的东西来为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.<br>对某事视而不见意味着没有注意到它或将其视为威胁。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.</p><p>Beth<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Haleigh Hurst<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.</p><p>Beth<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.</p><p>Neil<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.</p><p>Beth<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:</p><p>Maanvi Sharma<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.</p><p>Neil<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.</p><p>Beth<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.</p><p>Neil<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>TikTok.</p><p>Neil<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.</p><p>Beth<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.</p><p>Neil<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.</p><p>Beth<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.</p><p>Neil<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!</p><p>Neil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.<br>我是贝丝。在这个节目中，我们将讨论社交媒体在年轻人生活中的积极和消极因素。这是目前一个非常热门的话题，因为澳大利亚正在讨论一项限制 16 岁以下儿童使用社交媒体的新法律。Neil，告诉我在你的生活中拥有社交媒体的一件好事和一件坏事。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.<br>嗯，一件好事是我可以看到住在很远的朋友在做什么，一件坏事是它真的会让人上瘾，而且会浪费大量时间。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>嗯，Neil 听听男性的观点很有趣，因为当谈到网络欺凌等问题时，受影响最大的往往是年轻女性，所以很快我们就会听到不同国家&#x2F;地区的女性讲述她们的在线经历。请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到所有词汇和工作表，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?<br>但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。2024 年，世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个？是：a） Facebook？b） Instagram？或 c） TikTok？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.<br>哦，我要说的是 TikTok。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，让我们从社交媒体的积极一面开始。作为俄克拉荷马大学（Oklahoma University）的一名政治专业学生，21岁的哈利·赫斯特（Haleigh Hurst）参加了2024年美国总统大选。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 解释了社交媒体的一个好处：</p><p>Haleigh Hurst(哈利·赫斯特)<br>I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.<br>我确实认为社交媒体在教育年轻选民了解不同的政策和不同的竞选人方面发挥了巨大作用。我知道特朗普最近说，他心里对 TikTok 情有独钟。随着社交媒体的发展，它引发了更多的辩论。我想我们这一代人也见过很多高潮的事情发生。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.<br>Haleigh 认为社交媒体的一个好处是它引发了辩论和对话 —— 它导致辩论开始。她评论说唐纳德·特朗普是社交媒体的粉丝，他说他对TikTok情有独钟。如果你对某事或某人情有独钟，你会感到深情和喜欢它；你很喜欢它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.<br>但当然，这并不是故事的全部。越来越多的年轻女性报告了社交媒体对她们生活的负面影响，以及她们在网上显得“完美”的压力，尤其是来自男性的压力。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:<br>Maanvi Sharma 现年 28 岁，是一名女商人和模特，在 Instagram 上拥有大量粉丝，居住在印度德里。Kemi Adeyemi 是一位来自尼日利亚拉各斯的 26 岁旅游博主。这两位年轻女性都在 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 中讨论了这些社交媒体上的担忧：</p><p>Maanvi Sharma(马安维·夏尔马)<br>… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life…<br>…你正在约会的人，他们可能会因为社交媒体而离开你。他们可能会认为你不适合，你知道的，像……你不能因为你在社交媒体上而成为一个好的伙伴，因为你被很多人看着，他们对此感到有点害怕……“你知道吗，我们看到了你的女朋友 —— 哦，我的天哪！她穿着这个，天哪！但它正在影响我的个人生活……</p><p>Kemi Adeyemi(凯米·阿德耶米)<br>Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.<br>有些人或有些人，他们希望你缩小自己，这样他们就可以成为更大的人。他们可以听你的朋友怎么说你，你的家人怎么说你，但他们无法站出来为你说，’哦，我认识这个人。我相信她不是因为其他原因做这些事情。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.<br>Maanvi 认为一些男人被她在 Instagram 上的受欢迎程度吓倒了。Intimidated 的意思是因为你缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。她感觉到人们会八卦她的帖子和照片，使用诸如“哦，我的天哪”和“哦，我的上帝”之类的表达来表达他们的震惊或惊讶。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.<br>凯米同意。她说，在社交媒体上，有些人希望她缩小自己，这句话的意思是你没有充分利用自己的潜力，以避免让人们感到不舒服，或者为了融入。当她在网上被欺负时，凯米说这些人不会为她挺身而出。To stand up for someone 的意思是为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持。我认为你是时候透露你问题的答案了，Neil。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?<br>我问 2024 年世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个 —— Facebook、Instagram 还是 TikTok？你怎么说贝丝？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>TikTok.<br>TikTok的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.<br>恐怕你错了。它是 Facebook，拥有超过 30 亿的固定用户。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从动词 spark 开始，意思是导致某事开始发生，例如辩论或争论。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.<br>如果你对某人情有独钟，你就会对他们产生感情；你很喜欢他们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.<br>To be intimidated 的意思是因为您对某种情况缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.<br>“Oh my gosh！”和“Oh my God！”这些表达是对强烈情绪的感叹，如震惊、惊讶、愤怒或不相信。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.<br>如果你缩小自己，你就会让自己变得更小，并且不会充分利用你的潜力来让别人感到舒适，或者为了适应他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!<br>最后，To stand up for someone 的意思是大声疾呼地为遭受霸凌的人辩护。我们的时间又一次到了！但是，如果您准备好了解更多，请前往 BBC Learning English 网站尝试带有此计划的测验工作表！期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_001.png" class="" title="snapshot_001.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_002.png" class="" title="snapshot_002.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_003.png" class="" title="snapshot_003.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_004.png" class="" title="snapshot_004.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_005.png" class="" title="snapshot_005.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_006.png" class="" title="snapshot_006.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_007.png" class="" title="snapshot_007.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_008.png" class="" title="snapshot_008.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_009.png" class="" title="snapshot_009.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_010.png" class="" title="snapshot_010.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_011.png" class="" title="snapshot_011.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_012.png" class="" title="snapshot_012.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_013.png" class="" title="snapshot_013.png"><img src="/2025/02/20/wechat-2025-02-20/snapshot_014.png" class="" title="snapshot_014.png"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="a-soft-spot"><a href="#a-soft-spot" class="headerlink" title="a soft spot"></a>a soft spot</h4><p>an affectionate liking or fondness for someone or something<br>对…特别偏爱<br>对某人或某事物怀有深厚的喜爱或偏爱<br>He has a soft spot for his niece.<br>他特别疼爱他的侄女。</p><h4 id="spark"><a href="#spark" class="headerlink" title="spark"></a>spark</h4><p>cause (a debate, conversation, fight etc) to start happening<br>引发<br>引起（一场辩论、谈话、争吵等）的发生<br>Her speech sparked a heated debate.<br>她的讲话引发了一场激烈的辩论。</p><h4 id="intimidated"><a href="#intimidated" class="headerlink" title="intimidated"></a>intimidated</h4><p>frightened or nervous because of a lack of confidence<br>受恐吓的<br>由于缺乏自信而感到害怕或紧张<br>I was intimidated by his aggressive manner.<br>他的咄咄逼人的态度让我感到害怕。</p><h4 id="Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God"><a href="#Oh-my-gosh-Oh-my-God" class="headerlink" title="Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!"></a>Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!</h4><p>expression of feelings such as shock, surprise, anger, disbelief<br>我的天哪！<br>表达震惊、惊讶、愤怒、不相信等情绪的感叹词<br>Oh my gosh, did you see that car crash?<br>我的天哪，你看到那场车祸了吗？</p><h4 id="shrink-yourself"><a href="#shrink-yourself" class="headerlink" title="shrink yourself"></a>shrink yourself</h4><p>make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable<br>缩小自己<br>为了让别人感到舒服而让自己变得渺小，不发挥全部潜能<br>Don’t shrink yourself; let your talent shine.<br>别妄自菲薄；让你的才能闪光。</p><h4 id="stand-up-for-someone"><a href="#stand-up-for-someone" class="headerlink" title="stand up for (someone)"></a>stand up for (someone)</h4><p>be vocal in defending or supporting a person who is being criticised or bullied<br>为…辩护<br>大声疾呼为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持<br>She always stands up for the underdog.<br>她总是为弱者辩护。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.</p><p>Beth<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Phil<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?</p><p>Beth<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.</p><p>Phil<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.</p><p>Megan Lawton<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]</p><p>Andrea Jones<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.</p><p>Beth<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.</p><p>Phil<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.</p><p>Beth<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:</p><p>Dr William Brady<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.</p><p>Phil<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.</p><p>Beth<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.</p><p>Phil<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.</p><p>Phil<br>I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>It is, yes.</p><p>Phil<br>Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.</p><p>Beth<br>The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.</p><p>Phil<br>To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.</p><p>Phil<br>Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Phil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Phil.<br>您好，这里是 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语，我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.<br>如果你使用互联网，而且几乎每个人都使用互联网，你可能读过这样的头条新闻：你不会相信这位名人做了什么整容手术！像这样的标题被称为点击诱饵，用来吸引你的注意力并让你阅读更多内容。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>但现在，一种称为愤怒诱饵的新趋势正在社交媒体上传播。愤怒诱饵是旨在让您生气或愤怒的在线内容。在这个节目中，我们将探索愤怒诱饵的趋势，并且像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些都可以在我们的网站上找到，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?<br>很好，但首先是我的问题，贝丝，这是关于我们一直在使用的两个术语：“点击诱饵”和“愤怒诱饵”。两者都包含“诱饵”一词，但它的实际含义是什么？诱饵是否：a） 强烈的愤怒感？b） 用钩子钓鱼或动物的食物？c） 一个计算机软件？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.<br>我相当有信心它是 b） – 食物上钩。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。愤怒诱饵的工作原理是这样的：创作者在网上发布挑衅性内容，可能是一条消息，或者一个视频。人们看到它，感到愤怒，并愤怒地评论。其他人看到它、喜欢它并分享它。无论哪种方式，内容都会引起兴趣，增加互联网流量并为创作者赚钱。以下是营销策略师 Andrea Jones 向 BBC 世界服务节目主持人 Megan Lawton 解释的更多内容：</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.<br>他们创建的内容越多，他们获得的参与度就越高，他们获得的报酬就越多。所以他们会做任何事情……一些创作者会不惜一切代价获得更多观看次数，因为他们获得的观看次数越多，他们获得的报酬就越多，即使这些观看次数是负面的或煽动人们的愤怒和愤怒。</p><p>Megan Lawton(梅根·劳顿)<br>Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]<br>Andrea，愤怒诱饵与点击诱饵或其他在线策略有何不同？[…]</p><p>Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)<br>As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.<br>作为一名营销人员，我总是，你知道的，指导我的客户，并与他们讨论在他们的营销中使用钩子，对吧？我认为 hook 和 rage bait 甚至它失传已久的表亲 clickbait 内容之间的区别……当我们考虑一个钩子时，对我来说，钩子准确地反映了该内容中的内容，它来自一个信任的地方，而愤怒诱饵的内容则被设计为纵性的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.<br>Andrea 说，帖子得到的反应越多，创作者赚的钱就越多，即使这些反应是仇恨的。她使用结构，一件事发生得越多，其他事情发生得越多，来表明当一件事反复发生时，另一件事也会因此而增加。例如，你练习英语的次数越多，你的进步就越大。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.<br>这些内容旨在煽动愤怒 —— 鼓励令人不快或暴力的反应，这并不重要。这就是为什么 Andrea 认为愤怒诱饵比点击诱饵更糟糕。虽然点击诱饵的内容更真实，但愤怒诱饵是纵性的，这意味着它试图影响某事以使其自身有利。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:<br>所以，不难看出为什么很多人认为愤怒诱饵是有毒的。所以，如果你想知道人们为什么首先会做出反应，请听听威廉·布雷迪博士向 BBC 世界服务部《商业日报》解释愤怒诱饵背后的心理学：</p><p>Dr William Brady(WilliamBrady博士)<br>If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.<br>如果你是一个有影响力的人，你想弄清楚，’好吧，我如何在我的内容上获得更多的眼球？嗯，你需要利用我们在心理学中存在的那些偏见，因为那是我们将更加关注的内容。反过来，这就是算法将放大的内容，这最终意味着更多的广告收入。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.<br>有影响力的人希望他们的内容有更多的眼球 —— 更多的人查看他们的网站或社交媒体帖子 —— 并利用人类心理学来做到这一点。从心理学上讲，我们都有偏见 – 感觉 – 这些偏见通常是无意识的，要么支持要么反对某个想法或一群人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.<br>偏见是情绪化的，由于倾听我们的情绪对人类物种的进化至关重要，创作者知道激发我们的情绪会吸引我们的注意力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.<br>那么，可以做些什么来对抗愤怒诱饵呢？好吧，在做出反应之前，我们都可以花点时间思考一下。请记住，分享一些离谱的东西可能会让事情变得更糟，同时也会让创作者变得更富有。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.<br>好的，Phil，让我们揭示你问题的答案。你问我什么是“诱饵”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?<br>我做了。正确答案是 b） 把食物挂在钩子上以捕捉鱼或动物，贝丝，你不是这么说的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yes.<br>是的，是的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.<br>又对了！好，让我们回顾一下我们在该计划中学到的词汇，从愤怒诱饵开始，社交媒体内容旨在激起愤怒，从而鼓励人们参与其中。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.<br>结构，越多…越…描述一件事反复发生导致另一件事也发生的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.<br>To agite someone 的意思是鼓励他们做或感受不愉快或暴力的事情。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.<br>形容词 manipulative 描述了试图影响或控制某人以为自己谋取利益。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.<br>Eyeballs 是一个非正式词，指的是观看特定网站或电视节目的人数。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!<br>最后，偏见是感觉，通常是无意识的，支持或反对一个想法或一群人。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><img src="/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8715.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片15.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="rage-bait"><a href="#rage-bait" class="headerlink" title="rage bait"></a>rage bait</h4><p>social media content designed to provoke an emotional reaction so that people engage with the content thereby generating income for the online creator<br>愤怒诱饵<br>旨在激起情绪反应的社交媒体内容，以便人们参与其中，从而为网络创作者带来收入。<br>The inflammatory post was pure rage bait, designed to maximize engagement and profit.<br>煽动性的帖子纯粹是愤怒诱饵，旨在最大限度地提高参与度和利润。</p><h4 id="the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…"><a href="#the-more-X-…-the-more-Y-…" class="headerlink" title="the more (X)… the more (Y)…"></a>the more (X)… the more (Y)…</h4><p>as one thing (X) happens repeatedly, another thing (Y) happens more as a result<br>越…越…<br>一件事情(X)反复发生，另一件事情(Y)的结果就越多。<br>The more he studied, the more confident he became in his abilities.<br>他学习越多，就越自信。</p><h4 id="incite"><a href="#incite" class="headerlink" title="incite"></a>incite</h4><p>encourage someone to do or feel something unpleasant or violent; stir up; provoke; rouse<br>煽动<br>鼓励某人做或感受令人不快或暴力的事情；煽动；挑衅；激起。<br>His inflammatory speech incited the mob to riot.<br>他煽动性的演讲煽动了暴民暴动。</p><h4 id="manipulative"><a href="#manipulative" class="headerlink" title="manipulative"></a>manipulative</h4><p>trying to influence or control someone to your advantage<br>操纵性的<br>试图利用他人达到自己的目的。<br>Her manipulative tactics alienated her friends.<br>她操纵性的策略使她疏远了朋友。</p><h4 id="eyeballs"><a href="#eyeballs" class="headerlink" title="eyeballs"></a>eyeballs</h4><p>the number of people viewing a particular website, television programme etc.<br>眼球数<br>观看特定网站、电视节目等的人数。<br>The new campaign attracted millions of eyeballs.<br>这项新活动吸引了数百万眼球。</p><h4 id="biases"><a href="#biases" class="headerlink" title="biases"></a>biases</h4><p>feelings, often hidden or unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people<br>偏见<br>经常是隐藏的或无意识的，对某种想法或人群的偏好或偏见。<br>Unconscious biases can significantly affect decision-making.<br>无意识的偏见会严重影响决策。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.</p><p>Beth<br>Very nice!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:</p><p>Marnie Chesterton<br>My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!</p><p>Phil<br>Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.</p><p>Beth<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.</p><p>Phil<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:</p><p>Tristan Ahtone<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.</p><p>Beth<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous.

Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?<br>我是贝丝。Phil，是什么让家对你来说很特别？也许是睡在自己的床上，窗外的风景，或者是心爱的家庭宠物。是什么让你感觉像在家一样，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.<br>你知道吗？我想就是在我的沙发上，在我的客厅里放松。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Very nice!<br>很好！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:<br>好吧，你可能没有意识到，但对于你的大脑来说，家最强的标志之一是气味。听听 BBC 主持人 Marnie Chesterton 和 Tristan Ahtone 描述给他们带来家的感觉的气味：</p><p>Marnie Chesterton(玛妮·切斯特顿)<br>My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.<br>我爷爷的房子闻起来有松树的味道，还有潮湿和发霉的书籍的味道。</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.<br>我知道我妈妈的香水，我爸爸最喜欢的肥皂。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!<br>在这个节目中，我们将找出为什么我们的嗅觉对家的感觉如此重要，即使我们没有注意到它。与往常一样，我们将介绍一些有用的新词汇，如果您 bbclearningenglish.com 访问我们的网站，您会找到该程序的文字记录，供您在收听时阅读，并且还有一个免费的工作表！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?<br>好主意，贝丝！但现在是我提问的时候了。嗅觉非常强大，但并不是每个人都有。一小部分人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。那么，根据雷丁大学的研究，没有嗅觉的人占百分之几呢？是：a） 2%吗？b） 5%？或者，c） 7%？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.<br>哦，我要说 b） 5%。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:<br>好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。你有没有放假回家，注意到家里有一股奇怪的气味？如果你有，别担心 —— 这还不错，事实上有科学原因，正如科学作家特里斯坦·阿通 （Tristan Ahtone） 对 BBC 国际服务节目《意想不到的元素》所解释的那样：</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.<br>我一直在想的一件事是，每栋房子或每个家庭都有一股气味。当你从长途旅行回来时，你可能真的会在自己的家里注意到这一点，当你踏入前门时，东西闻起来有点奇怪。虽然您的房子很有可能因为已经关闭了几周而闻起来很奇怪，但您也有可能闻到家通常闻起来的味道，但当您在那里时，您只是没有注意到它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.<br>特里斯坦说，当你离开后回到家时，你的房子很有可能闻起来很奇怪，这个形容词的意思是奇怪或不寻常。如果你说某事发生的可能性很大，你的意思是它发生的可能性很高。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:<br>事实是，每个家都有气味，尽管我们已经习惯了，但我们通常不会注意到。当我们吸气时，鼻子中的受体细胞会检测到空气中的分子，并将它们发送到大脑中的嗅觉器官。这些分析气味是否存在危险。你闻不到自己家的原因是它对你没有威胁。这是科学作家 Tristan Ahtone 再次向 BBC 国际服务节目 Unexpected Elements 解释更多内容：</p><p>Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)<br>Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.<br>好吧，通过过滤掉常见的非威胁性气味，可以更容易地检测到可能危险的异常事物。所以，例如，如果你忘记了吐司，它开始燃烧，你通常会很快闻到这种气味，因为这是你所处环境的变化。然后，您大脑的其他部分开始发挥作用，将烟味理解为潜在的伤害或威胁。但是，即使我们无法闻到自己家的气味，它们的气味仍然很重要，因为它与我们对舒适和安全的认识纠缠在一起。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.<br>通过过滤掉熟悉的气味，我们的大脑能够检测到其他不寻常、不寻常或不常见且可能很危险的气味。To filter something out 的意思是从其他事物中删除或分离不需要的事物。例如，过滤掉家的气味意味着我们会注意到烤面包燃烧的气味或其他气味，提醒我们可能的危险。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.<br>尽管我们通常不会注意到家中的气味 —— 特殊的气味 —— 但它仍然对大脑处理记忆和情感的边缘系统产生影响。这就解释了为什么气味对我们的感受有如此强烈的影响，以及为什么我们在家里感到舒适和安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>对，Phil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.<br>是的，它是。我问你有多少百分比的人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。答案是 b） 5%，我想这就是你说的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is, yeah!<br>是的，是的！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well done!<br>干的好！</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.<br>好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从嗅觉丧失开始，意思是没有嗅觉或嗅觉有限。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.<br>形容词 weird 的意思是奇怪、奇怪或奇异。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.<br>当有人说某事很有可能发生时，他们的意思是它很可能会发生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.<br>短语 out of the ordinary 的意思是不寻常、不常见或例外。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.<br>如果你过滤掉一些东西，你就会从物质中去除或分离不需要的东西。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal.

I’m Pippa.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil.</p><p>Pippa<br>Now, Neil, have you ever wanted to be a musician?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh yes, Pippa, I still want to be a musician. I’ve been playing my guitar since I was 14.</p><p>Pippa<br>Wow. Well, maybe one day you’ll, you’ll manage it. Who knows?</p><p>Neil<br>What about you?</p><p>Pippa<br>I don’t think I’d like to be a musician. I think it would be a bit stressful. Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful.</p><p>Neil<br>Yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too.</p><p>Pippa<br>But first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley</p><p>Neil<br>Oh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.</p><p>Neil<br>This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson<br>I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.</p><p>Neil<br>When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.</p><p>Neil<br>The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.</p><p>Pippa<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.</p><p>Josh Robinson<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.</p><p>Pippa<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.</p><p>Neil<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.</p><p>Pippa<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Of course I would.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall</p><p>Neil<br>Wow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more.</p><p>Pippa<br>Well you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com. We’ll also put a link in the notes below this episode!</p><p>Neil<br>OK. So, what about your question, Pippa?</p><p>Pippa<br>Yes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts? The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley? And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18.</p><p>Neil<br>Really? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well.</p><p>Pippa<br>OK.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.</p><p>Pippa<br>Songwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.</p><p>Neil<br>A bunch of people is a group of people.</p><p>Pippa<br>The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone.</p><p>Neil<br>Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.</p><p>Pippa<br>Your main earner is your main source of income.</p><p>Neil<br>Gigs are musical concerts.</p><p>Pippa<br>And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.</p><p>Neil<br>Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.<br>我在圣艾夫斯一个非常丰富的音乐环境中长大。我从大约 11 岁开始就开始打开麦克风。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.<br>这是贝利。她住在英格兰西南海岸康沃尔郡的圣艾夫斯。她说她从小就打算参加 Open Mic 之夜。Open Mic 之夜是任何人都可以唱歌或播放音乐的活动。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.<br>Bailey 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中谈到了她作为音乐家的生活。</p><p>Bailey Tomkinson(贝利·汤姆金森)<br>I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.<br>我会去 Kettle 的这些词曲作者圈子，眨眨眼，比如，周五放学后，我会成为最年轻的 50 岁的人。但我会和一群老人围坐在一个圈子里，他们会演奏 James Taylor、Carole King 和 The Eagles 以及很多 70 年代的音乐，我想这对我影响很大。但我想，你知道，每个人都把我放在他们的羽翼下。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.<br>年轻时，贝利去了词曲作者圈子。这些会议是为有兴趣创作自己的音乐的人准备的。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.<br>Bailey 记得和一群老人坐在一起。A bunch 是谈论一群人的非正式方式。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.<br>乐队中的老人们会演奏 1970 年代的音乐，贝利说他们把她放在自己的羽翼下。如果你把某人放在你的羽翼下，你就会决定保护他们或引导他们。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Let’s meet another musician, Josh.<br>让我们来认识另一位音乐家 Josh。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.<br>所以，我在大约 13 岁的时候学会了我的第一首正式的吉他歌曲。我真的在我能做到的那一刻就开始表演了。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.<br>Josh 住在伦敦，是一名街头艺人。这意味着他在街上或公共场所表演以赚钱。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.<br>街头表演是音乐家赚钱和向更多人表演的常见方式。正如 Josh 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中所说的那样，它可以帮助音乐家获得新的机会。</p><p>Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)<br>It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.<br>这有点像我的主要收入来源，让我在过去十年左右的时间里一直坚持下去。从那时起，它为我带来了各种不同的机会。它有我所有的演出，它有我所有的人脉。所以我欠街头表演很多。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.<br>街头表演是 Josh 的主要收入来源，也是他的主要资金来源。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.<br>他说，街头表演让他获得了所有的演出和人脉。演出是音乐会。这是一个非正式的俚语。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?<br>Josh 说他欠街头表演很多。如果你欠某人或某事很多，那么你会因为那个人或事而获得成功或幸福。那么，你想听一些 Josh 的音乐吗，Neil？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Of course I would.<br>我当然会。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall<br>嗯，这是他的歌曲《那边的墙》（That Side of the Wall），他为 BBC 学习英语节目《我的歌，我的家》（My Song， My Home） 演唱了这首歌。歌曲剪辑 你能给我留下点东西吗 你能把它留在门口吗 所以我知道有什么东西或某人 那边的墙 阻止热量来临 因为我总是喜欢寒冷 我需要一些归属感 或者某人 那边的墙</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Wow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more.<br>哇。乔什还不错，不是吗？我很想听听更多。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Well you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

So, what about your question, Pippa?<br>还行。那么，皮帕，你的问题呢？</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Yes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts? The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley? And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18.<br>是的，我问哪位艺术家在英国排行榜上排名第一的歌曲最多？披头士乐队、艾德·希兰 （Ed Sheeran） 还是猫王 （Elvis Presley）？你说的是披头士乐队，尼尔。但答案实际上是猫王。他有 21 首排名第一的歌曲，披头士乐队有 18 首。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Really? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well.<br>真？好吧，没关系，我也喜欢《国王》。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>OK.<br>还行。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.<br>好，让我们回顾一下我们在这一集音乐剧中学到的词汇，从开放麦克风之夜开始，任何人都可以唱歌或播放音乐的活动。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Songwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.<br>词曲作者圈子是有兴趣创作自己的音乐的人的聚会。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A bunch of people is a group of people.<br>一群人就是一群人。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone.<br>这句话 take someone under your wing 的意思是保护或引导某人。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.<br>街头艺人是在公共场所表演赚钱，街头艺人是在街上表演赚钱的人。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>Your main earner is your main source of income.<br>您的主要收入来源是您的主要收入来源。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Gigs are musical concerts.<br>演出是音乐会。</p><p>Pippa(皮帕)<br>And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.<br>而 to dowe a lot to someone or something 这句话，意思是因为那个人或事物而获得成功或幸福。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.</p><p>Beth<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Phil<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?</p><p>Beth<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.</p><p>Phil<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:</p><p>Adam Chandler<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.</p><p>Beth<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.</p><p>Phil<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.</p><p>Beth<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.</p><p>Phil<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.</p><p>Beth<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.</p><p>Phil<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.</p><p>Beth<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.</p><p>Phil<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.</p><p>Beth<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.</p><p>Phil<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.</p><p>Beth<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!</p><p>Phil<br>Goodbye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?<br>不管你喜欢还是讨厌，毫无疑问，快餐很受欢迎。贝丝，你是快餐迷吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.<br>呃，不是真的，不是。我认为有时它可能非常方便，显然是因为它很快，但并非真的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.<br>好吧，无论你怎么看它们，像肯德基、达美乐，当然还有大麦当劳这样的快餐品牌，都取得了令人难以置信的成功。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在本节目中，我们将讨论快餐从 1950 年代美国开始的全球传播。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?<br>但首先，我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。英国大约有多少家快餐店？是：a） 4,000 个？b） 42,000 人？或者，c） 四百万？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m going to go for b) 42,000.<br>我要选 b） 42,000。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:<br>好的，稍后我们会找出答案。在美国，自 1950 年代以来，汉堡包、炸薯条和奶昔等廉价易行的食物一直很受欢迎。请听亚当·钱德勒 （Adam Chandler） 讲述 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》（The Food Chain） 的故事，该书追溯了美国快餐的历史，该书的作者 Drive-Thru Dreams 讲述了这一切是如何开始的：</p><p>Adam Chandler(亚当·钱德勒)<br>At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.<br>快餐故事的核心是一种非常 “任何人都可以做到 ”的感觉。许多公司创始人没有大学学位，在很多情况下没有高中学历，不是靠金钱赚钱的，他们通常只是准备将自己插入一个适合他们的系统的人。它确实做到了。在那个时代，机会变得非常、非常容易，因为这是美国经验的新部分。所以，在很小的方面，美国梦在很大程度上变成了美国梦。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.<br>快餐的兴起反映了二战后美国经济实力的崛起。当 Adam 说这是故事的核心时，他的意思是这是故事中最重要的部分。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.<br>在 1950 年代，当我们今天所知道的著名品牌刚刚起步时，任何具有积极进取的态度的人都可以销售快餐。“我能行”的态度描述了一个有信心并决心解决问题并取得成果的人。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.<br>这正是 Kentucky Fried Chicken 和 McDonald’s 等成功餐厅发生的事情。对许多人来说，这些快餐品牌象征着美国梦 —— 即在美国，任何人都可以通过努力工作和决心取得成功。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.<br>肯德基、麦当劳和其他公司的成功不仅限于美国。如今，您可以参观地球两侧的两家麦当劳，并吃完全相同的饭菜。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.<br>但并不是每个国家都张开怀抱欢迎 —— 冰岛这个小岛就是其中之一。安迪·索菲亚·方丹 （Andie Sophia Fontaine） 曾经在麦当劳工作，现在是《冰岛评论》的编辑。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain，当麦当劳开始在冰岛首都雷克雅未克销售汉堡时，它受到了冷遇。</p><p>Andie Sophia Fontaine(安迪·索菲亚·方丹)<br>There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.<br>冰岛的汉堡文化由来已久。他们对汉堡包有自己的想法，他们将使用生菜、生黄瓜和一种炸酱 —— 称为 shalpuborgari，或商店汉堡，已经存在了很长时间。是的，所以麦当劳 —— 他们努力维持市场。棺材上的最后一枚钉子是 2008&#x2F;2009 年的全球金融危机。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.<br>冰岛已经有吃汉堡的悠久传统 —— 这一传统已经存在了很长时间。例如，shalpuborgari 或商店汉堡是美国汉堡包的变体。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.<br>麦当劳在冰岛并不像其他地方那样成功。而 2008 年的全球金融危机是棺材上的最后一枚钉子，这一事件导致了已经开始出错的事情的失败。直到今天，冰岛还没有麦当劳，不像英国，这让我想起了你的问题，菲尔。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.<br>是的。我问你英国有多少家快餐店。我问你是 4,000 人、42,000 人还是 400 万人。当然，答案是 42,000 个，所以你是对的，干得好！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从核心开始，意思是某事最重要的部分或原因。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.<br>如果你说某人有“我能行”的态度，你的意思是他们有信心采取行动、解决问题和应对新的挑战。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.<br>美国梦是相信如果努力工作，美国每个人都有机会获得成功和快乐。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.<br>这个形容词 long-based 的意思是已经存在了很长时间。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.<br>对某物的接受意味着一种变体，或一种新的呈现方式。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon!<br>最后，谚语 the final nail in the coffin，指的是导致已经开始失败的事情最终结束的事件。我们的六分钟又一次结束了，但为什么不前往 BBC Learning English 网站，在那里您可以找到专门针对此计划的工作表和测验。期待很快与您相见！</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Goodbye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2025/01/23/wechat-2025-01-23/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="at-the-heart-of"><a href="#at-the-heart-of" class="headerlink" title="at the heart of"></a>at the heart of</h4><p>to be the most important part, or main cause, of something<br>核心<br>是某事最重要的部分或主要原因<br>The success of the project lies at the heart of our future plans.<br>项目的成功是未来计划的核心。</p><h4 id="can-do-attitude"><a href="#can-do-attitude" class="headerlink" title="can-do attitude"></a>can-do attitude</h4><p>showing determination and confidence to take action and achieve results<br>积极进取的态度<br>表现出决心和信心去采取行动并取得成果<br>Her can-do attitude impressed the interviewers.<br>她积极进取的态度给面试官留下了深刻印象。</p><h4 id="The-American-dream"><a href="#The-American-dream" class="headerlink" title="The American dream"></a>The American dream</h4><p>the idea that everyone in the United States of America has the chance to be successful and happy if they work hard<br>美国梦<br>在美国，只要努力工作，每个人都有机会获得成功和幸福的理念<br>He believed in the American dream, working tirelessly to achieve his goals.<br>他相信美国梦，为实现目标而不懈努力。</p><h4 id="long-standing"><a href="#long-standing" class="headerlink" title="long-standing"></a>long-standing</h4><p>having existed for a long time<br>长期存在的<br>存在了很长时间<br>There’s a long-standing dispute between the two countries.<br>两国之间存在长期争端。</p><h4 id="a-take-on-something"><a href="#a-take-on-something" class="headerlink" title="a take on (something)"></a>a take on (something)</h4><p>a variation of, or new way of presenting, something which already exists<br>对（某事物）的诠释；一种（新的）处理方法<br>对已存在事物的变体或新的呈现方式<br>His take on the classic novel was both innovative and insightful.<br>他对这部经典小说的诠释既有创新性又富于洞察力。</p><h4 id="the-final-nail-in-the-coffin"><a href="#the-final-nail-in-the-coffin" class="headerlink" title="the final nail in the coffin"></a>the final nail in the coffin</h4><p>(idiom) an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail<br>最后一击；致命的一击<br>（习语）导致已经开始失败的事物最终结束的事件<br>The loss of their biggest client was the final nail in the coffin for the company.<br>失去最大的客户是这家公司彻底倒闭的最后一击。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?</p><p>Beth<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.</p><p>Beth<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.</p><p>Beth<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.</p><p>Phil<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.</p><p>Beth<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.</p><p>Phil<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.</p><p>Sean Coughlan<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.</p><p>Rando Kuustik<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.</p><p>Phil<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.</p><p>Beth<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.</p><p>Phil<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?</p><p>Beth<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.</p><p>Phil<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.</p><p>Beth<br>Rivals are competitors.</p><p>Phil<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.</p><p>Beth<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz related to this programme, and we’ll see you again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I’m Phil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是贝丝。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?<br>所以，贝丝，我们谈论的是当今世界上最好的教育系统。你在英国上学。您如何看待英国的教育体系？你认为这可能是最好的吗？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.<br>我认为它相当不错，我个人可能会改变它的一些事情，但我想说它相当不错，但可能不是世界上最好的。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.<br>好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论 Pisa 排名。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.<br>该排名基于经合组织（OECD）每三年进行的一次测试。这些测试试图显示哪些国家在数学、科学和阅读教学方面最有效。但这真的可以衡量吗？嗯，这是前 BBC 教育记者肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 与 BBC 世界服务节目“全球故事”的对话。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.<br>当它们第一次被引入时，这是一个非常有争议的想法，因为人们说’你怎么可能比较大国……你怎么能把美国与卢森堡或中国的部分地区，或者其他什么地方进行比较呢？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.<br>肖恩说，这些测试是有争议的。如果某件事是有争议的，那么它就是人们可能会争论的事情 —— 它是有争议的。因此，起初，比萨测试是有争议的，因为不是每个人都认为比较非常不同的国家是公平的。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?<br>Phil，我有一个关于他们的问题要问你。因此，在 2022 年，新加坡在阅读排名中名列前茅。但这些国家中哪些位居第二呢？是：a） 美国？b） 爱尔兰？或者，c） 英国？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it might be b) Ireland.<br>我想可能是 b） 爱尔兰。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目结束时发现这是否正确。比萨排名的一个常见模式是，最成功的国家往往规模较小。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 在接受 BBC 国际频道节目“全球故事”采访时告诉我们，许多西欧大国在排名中的得分并不高。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.<br>他们被这些快速崛起的国家超越和超越 —— 你知道的，新加坡、爱沙尼亚、台湾，或者那些我们历史上不认为是经济竞争对手的地方，但我想 PISA 测试的论点是，如果你想拥有一种知识经济，一种基于技能的经济，这就是你衡量它的方式。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.<br>我们听说许多欧洲大国正在被小国超越。如果有人超过你，他们就会比你走得更快 —— 速度更高。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.<br>我们使用前缀 ‘out-‘ 来表示某人或某事更擅长做某事。我们还听说，小国“跑赢”大国 —— 它们的表现更好。新加坡、爱沙尼亚和台湾被描述为欧洲大国的经济竞争对手 —— 这意味着它们在经济上正在与这些国家竞争。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>我们还听说了知识经济。这是一个以服务行业为基础的经济，这些行业要求工人受过高等教育，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.<br>那么，是什么让各国在这些测试中表现得更好呢？让我们再次聆听 BBC 国际服务节目“全球故事”。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 告诉我们，那些优先考虑让每个人都达到一定水平的国家做得很好。我们还听取了爱沙尼亚学校校长 Rando Kuustik 的发言。</p><p>Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)<br>Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.<br>确保所有学生都能接受一定水平的教育达到一定标准的国家，无论他们的背景如何，都做得很好。</p><p>Rando Kuustik(兰多·库斯蒂克)<br>If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.<br>如果你用不同的水平或能力来教他们，那么你就是在隔离他们，我们不想把世界上的任何人都隔离开来，为什么我们在学校里这样做呢？这是爱沙尼亚成功的主要原因之一。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.<br>Sean 说，最成功的系统将每个人都教育到特定的标准，无论他们的背景如何。如果一件事发生而不考虑其他事情，这意味着其他事情不重要，或者不是问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.<br>兰多·库斯蒂克 （Rando Kuustik） 说，爱沙尼亚的学校不想隔离学生。隔离的意思是分离和保持分离。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?<br>那么，我们刚刚听说了爱沙尼亚，但贝丝，您的问题呢？那些国家呢？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.<br>我问你，在 2022 年 Pisa 排名中，美国、爱尔兰和英国的阅读量排名第二。你说的是爱尔兰，这是正确的答案。干的好！好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的关于教育排名的词汇，从有争议的 - 争论的或有争议的开始。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.<br>如果你被某人超越，他们就会比你走得更快。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Rivals are competitors.<br>竞争对手就是竞争对手。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.<br>知识经济是一种基于需要受过高等教育的工人的行业，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.<br>如果某件事发生，而不考虑第二件事，那么第二件事对它的发生没有影响。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Phil<br>Most people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth?</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you?</p><p>Phil<br>I ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious!</p><p>Beth<br>Oh, OK. Good!</p><p>Phil<br>Well, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>But let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:</p><p>David Shirley<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.</p><p>Phil<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.</p><p>Phil<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.</p><p>Beth<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.</p><p>Beth<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.</p><p>Phil<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.</p><p>Beth<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.</p><p>Phil<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.</p><p>Beth<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:<br>但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain：</p><p>David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)<br>I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.<br>我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.<br>大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?<br>50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.<br>哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:<br>还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜：</p><p>Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)<br>In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.<br>在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.<br>厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.<br>哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:<br>玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物：</p><p>Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)<br>In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.<br>从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.<br>让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?<br>生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.<br>啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.<br>当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The verb replenish means to fill something up again.<br>动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.<br>如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.<br>当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?</p><p>Phil<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?</p><p>Beth<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.</p><p>Beth<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.</p><p>Phil<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Beth<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?</p><p>Phil<br>I think it’s around 80% water.</p><p>Beth<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:</p><p>Professor John Speakman<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.</p><p>Phil<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.</p><p>Phil<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.</p><p>Beth<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.</p><p>Phil<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.</p><p>Phil<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.</p><p>Beth<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.</p><p>Phil<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.</p><p>Beth<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.</p><p>Phil<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.</p><p>Beth<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.</p><p>Phil<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?<br>我是 Beth。如今，我经常看到人们随身携带水瓶以确保他们喝得足够。你每天喝多少水，Phil？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?<br>哦，我不知道。也许大约一升？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?<br>还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s probably about two litres.<br>我想大概是两升。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.<br>啊，嗯，很多人听说的数字是每天两升。当然，每个人都需要喝一些水 —— 人体的一半以上是由水组成的。但是，我们究竟需要多少水才能保持健康呢？这就是我们将在本节目中讨论的内容，以及一些有用的新词汇。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.<br>说到词汇，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上下载该节目中的所有新单词和短语，以及帮助您学习它们的工作表练习，bbclearningenglish.com。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?<br>太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>I think it’s around 80% water.<br>我认为大约 80% 是水。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:<br>好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授：</p><p>Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)<br>So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.<br>所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.<br>Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.<br>是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.<br>然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.<br>实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.<br>但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。</p><p>Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)<br>And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.<br>而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.<br>Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.<br>因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.<br>如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.<br>这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.<br>一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.<br>脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。</p><p>Phil(菲尔)<br>And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p><p>Beth<br>And I’m Beth.</p><p>Neil<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.</p><p>Beth<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.</p><p>Beth<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.</p><p>Neil<br>What was the voice?</p><p>Beth<br>Hello?</p><p>Neil<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.</p><p>Beth<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.</p><p>Neil<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.</p><p>Beth<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?</p><p>Neil<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.</p><p>Neil<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.</p><p>Beth<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.</p><p>Neil<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:</p><p>James Gallagher<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.</p><p>Beth<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.</p><p>Neil<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?</p><p>Beth<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.</p><p>Beth<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.</p><p>Neil<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.</p><p>Beth<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.</p><p>Beth<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. See you there!</p><p>Beth<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’m Neil.<br>你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>And I’m Beth.<br>我是 Beth。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.<br>很多事情都会让我们感到尴尬 —— 当你的脸涨红，你希望自己能消失时，那种自我意识、不舒服的感觉。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?<br>你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.<br>是的，很多。有一次我在停车场遇到了我的父母，我看到他们开着他们的车来了，我以一种非常愚蠢的方式挥了挥手。但不幸的是，我很快发现那不是我的父母。那是另一对。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.<br>哦，不，这真的很尴尬。我记得接电话时，我以为是我最好的朋友，我用非常愚蠢的声音说了一声“你好”，然后他们要求和我爸爸说话，但那不是我的朋友。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What was the voice?<br>声音是什么？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Hello?<br>你好？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.<br>哦，天哪。但尴尬不仅仅是害羞和脸红。当谈到我们的健康时，有无穷无尽的事情值得尴尬。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.<br>是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.<br>在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?<br>所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.<br>所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.<br>还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。</p><p>As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)<br>difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释：</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.<br>因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.<br>许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.<br>对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:<br>医生也可以通过多种方式提供帮助，正如 Vanessa Apea 博士在这里向 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 解释的那样：</p><p>James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)<br>Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?<br>您能告诉我们您用了什么技巧来让人们放心吗？</p><p>Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)<br>I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.<br>我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查……我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间……所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.<br>詹姆斯问医生可以做些什么来让人们放松 —— 让他们感到平静和放松 —— Apea 医生描述了她理想的对话：这是一个安全的空间，不带评判，所说的是保密的，保密的，不与任何人分享。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?<br>除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?<br>是的。我问你：有多少百分比的人说他们因为尴尬而推迟去看医生，但后来被诊断出患有健康状况？你还记得你说过的话吗，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I think I said c) 61%.<br>是的，我想我说的是 c） 61%。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.<br>恐怕这不是正确的答案。事实上，它是 a） 21% 或略高于五分之一。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的新词汇，从 delay 开始，推迟或推迟到以后。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.<br>To diagnose a disease or medical condition 的意思是通过识别症状和检查患者来识别它。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.<br>如果你默默忍受，你会忍受痛苦的感觉，并在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦的感受作斗争。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.<br>短语动词 put someone at ease 的意思是让某人感到平静和放松。</p><p>Beth(贝丝)<br>The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.<br>形容词 confidential 的意思是保密和秘密，并描述不与其他任何人共享的信息。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.</p><p>Dan<br>And I’m Dan.</p><p>Rob<br>Now, do you know who Michelle Obama is?</p><p>Dan<br>Er, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.</p><p>Rob<br>That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?</p><p>Dan <br>th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.</p><p>Rob<br>OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?</p><p>BBC News Report<br>The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.</p><p>Rob <br>So, where did she revisit on this trip?</p><p>Dan<br>She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.</p><p>Rob<br>The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.</p><p>Dan<br>One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.</p><p>Rob<br>There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.</p><p>Dan<br>I get that feeling all the time!</p><p>Rob<br>I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.</p><p>Dan<br>Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.</p><p>Rob<br>Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.</p><p>Michelle Obama<br>That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.</p><p>Rob<br>She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.</p><p>Dan<br>She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.</p><p>Rob <br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?</p><p>Dan<br>I thought it was the 20th Century.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, you were right.</p><p>Dan<br>Yay!</p><p>Rob<br>th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Dan<br>We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.</p><p>Rob<br>Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.</p><p>Dan <br>The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative.

To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.</p><p>Dan<br>The next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from.</p><p>Rob<br>And finally there was the noun phrase station in life.</p><p>Dan<br>Your station in life is your position in society – your social status.</p><p>Rob<br>And that brings us to the end of this week’s programme.

Bye bye for now. </p><p>Dan<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.<br>你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 罗伯。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>And I’m Dan.<br>我是 Dan。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Now, do you know who Michelle Obama is?<br>现在，你知道米歇尔·奥巴马是谁吗？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Er, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.<br>呃，是的。也许是世界上最著名的女性？前第一夫人，这意味着她是美利坚合众国总统的妻子。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?<br>这是正确的。她刚刚出版了自己的自传，并一直在英国谈论她的生活。在我们了解更多信息之前，以下是本周的问题。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪还是，c） 20 世纪，有什么想法吗？</p><p>Dan (担 )<br>th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.<br>th 这可能是一个棘手的问题。第一任美国总统是在 18 世纪，他们有妻子，但我认为实际的术语可能只是在很久以后才引入的 —— 所以我要大胆猜测一下，说 20 世纪。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?<br>还行。好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 对英国的访问进行了 BBC 新闻报道。根据这份报告，她去过哪里，而她以前去过哪里？</p><p>BBC News Report(BBC新闻报道)<br>The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.<br>这位前第一夫人公开谈论了许多问题，她的主要信息之一是关于赋权。当天早些时候，奥巴马夫人再次访问了伦敦北部的一所学校，她说，她在担任第一夫人期间第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>So, where did she revisit on this trip?<br>那么，她这次旅行重访了哪里呢？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.<br>她在伦敦北部的一所学校上学。她说，正是在这所学校，她第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。如果你受到启发去做某事，你会有一种强烈的感觉，你想做某事，你会有一种强烈的动力去实现某件事，通常是因为别人说过或取得了成就。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.<br>该报告还提到，她公开谈论了一些问题。公开谈论某事是指您讨论一个话题，通常是一个困难的话题，而不试图隐藏事实或您的感受。当人们谈论生活中他们觉得困难或尴尬的事情时，会用到这个短语。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.<br>她公开谈论的一件事是她自己觉得自己并不真正属于这里，她真的有技能或才能来做她正在做的事情，她不配得到这个职位。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.<br>它有一个名字。这被称为冒名顶替者综合症 —— 那种感觉，你认为有一天每个人都会意识到你真的不太擅长你所做的事情。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>I get that feeling all the time!<br>我一直都有这种感觉！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.<br>我想知道为什么？因为这种冒名顶替者综合症的问题在于它没有道理。这更多的是缺乏自信或社会给我们贴标签的结果。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.<br>好吧，无论如何，回到报告。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 也热衷于谈论赋权的话题。这给了人们力量、信心和力量，让他们靠自己实现他们想要的生活。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.<br>现在让我们听听米歇尔·奥巴马本人如何谈论我们有时如何根据他们的阶级而不是他们的个人能力来评判他们。</p><p>Michelle Obama(米歇尔·奥巴马)<br>That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.<br>这通常是我们犯的错误，我们假设工人阶级本身并不具有很高的天赋，而很多时候你的生活地位受到你所处环境的限制。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.<br>她在这里说，我们根据人们的社会地位或生活中的地位来假设他们的事情。假设的意思是“做出的判断不是基于事实，而是基于我们认为是真实的”。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.<br>她自己使用了这个短语。当你说某人本身就有才华时，这意味着他们的才华来自他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们碰巧与之相关的任何组织、个人或阶级有任何联系。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?<br>在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪，还是 c） 20 世纪，还有丹，你说？</p><p>Dan(担)<br>I thought it was the 20th Century.<br>我以为是 20 世纪。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, you were right.<br>嗯，你是对的。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Yay!<br>耶！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.<br>但让我说完。你是对的，那时晚于 18 世纪，而 18 世纪是第一任美国总统任职的时候，但还没有到 20 世纪。19 世纪下半叶，第一夫人的头衔开始使用。现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.<br>我们从 to open ly talk about something 这句话开始。这意味着讨论某事，通常是一个困难的话题，而不隐藏您对该主题的感受、情绪或事实。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.<br>然后是名词 empowerment。这是给人一种他们掌控自己生活的感觉的过程，使人们对自己的权利和能力更有信心。</p><p>Dan (担 )<br>The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.<br>接下来是动词 inspire。如果你激励人们，你就会给他们一种感觉，他们想做一些事情，并且可以做一些困难的事情或有创意的事情。如果你自己也有这种感觉，你就会受到启发。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Next there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.<br>接下来是动词 to assume something。To assume 的意思是“不是根据证据，而是根据你认为或相信是真实的事物来判断某人或某事”。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>The next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from.<br>下一句话本身就是他们自己的。例如，如果某人本身就成功了，这意味着他们的成功是因为他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们为谁工作、与谁一起工作或他们来自哪个社会群体。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And finally there was the noun phrase station in life.<br>最后是名词短语 station in life。</p><p>Dan(担)<br>Your station in life is your position in society – your social status.<br>你的人生地位就是你在社会中的地位 —— 你的社会地位。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And that brings us to the end of this week’s programme.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>And I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>Today we’re talking about buttons.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen.</p><p>Rob<br>Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil?</p><p>Neil <br>Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.</p><p>Rob <br>OK. What does he say about children and buttons?</p><p>Neil<br>That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.</p><p>Neil<br>But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.</p><p>Rob<br>Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.</p><p>Rob<br>So then, why can’t we resist buttons?</p><p>Neil<br>Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.</p><p>Rob<br>The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?</p><p>Neil<br>No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.</p><p>Rob<br>And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.</p><p>Professor Steven Connor<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.</p><p>Rob <br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?</p><p>Neil<br>I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.</p><p>Rob<br>That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Neil<br>We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.</p><p>Rob<br>Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.</p><p>Neil <br>And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.</p><p>Rob<br>Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.</p><p>Neil<br>The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.</p><p>Rob<br>And finally we had grooming.</p><p>Neil<br>This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.</p><p>Rob<br>Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com.

What does say about children and buttons?<br>好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。Thinking Allowed 是 BBC Radio 4 的一档节目，涵盖了一系列有趣的话题。最近，他们讨论了纽扣以及它们对日常生活的重要性。剑桥大学英语教授 Steven Connor 参加了该节目，他谈到了纽扣的吸引力。关于子项和按钮，怎么说？</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.<br>我们确实喜欢纽扣，我认为纽扣的乐趣和诱惑……这种诱惑，每个人都能感受到，这就是为什么按钮必须非常方便。另一方面，它们必须远离儿童，所以它们必须放在墙上的高处，真正重要的按钮必须非常难以按下 —— 比如放在玻璃后面或其他东西。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>OK. What does he say about children and buttons?<br>还行。他对孩子和纽扣有什么看法？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.<br>他们必须远离他们！正如我之前所说，我小时候就喜欢按下按钮。我会按我看到的任何东西，所以重要的肯定是我够不着的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.<br>是的，他说纽扣是一种诱惑。诱惑是让你想做某事的东西，它经常被用来做你真的不应该做的事情。因此，导致潜在危险或严重后果的按钮（如火灾警报器）需要受到保护，也许是在玻璃后面，这样诱惑就不会战胜我们。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.<br>但是许多按钮在日常生活中都有有用的实用用途，例如呼叫电梯 - 因此这些按钮必须易于使用且没有困难。这个形容词很方便。这些日常按钮必须方便。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?<br>Connor 教授继续详细介绍了纽扣为何如此吸引人。他怎么看？</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.<br>你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So then, why can’t we resist buttons?<br>那么，为什么我们不能抗拒纽扣呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.<br>因为作为人类，我们有一种坐立不安的本能。我们不能长时间静止不动，我们需要经常四处走动，因为我们是非常数字化的生物。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?<br>不过，数字的使用与现代在线技术无关，不是吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.<br>不，手指是手指或脚趾。所以我们是数字生物 – 我们有手指，我们喜欢使用它们。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.<br>其他数字生物（如猿类）所做的一件事是梳理毛发。也就是说，他们用手清洁其他猿类的体毛。他们通过毛发寻找昆虫和虫子，然后把它们拉出来吃掉。但我们也可以用 grooming 这个词来形容人类，例如，一个整洁、干净、得体的人。又是康纳教授。</p><p>Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)<br>You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.<br>你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?<br>在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。有些人害怕纽扣，这是一种公认的恐惧症，但它叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，还有 Neil，你说的？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.<br>我没有，但我不认为这可能是 “纽扣恐惧症”，那太容易了。我认为 coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧，所以我选择了另一个 - koumpounophobia。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.<br>没错。Buttonophobia 是一个虚构的词，正如你所说，coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧。好，现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.<br>我们一直在谈论按钮。这些可以是我们用来固定衣服的小圆件，也可以是我们推动某事发生的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.<br>按钮可能是一种诱惑。我们看到一个，我们想推动它。所以诱惑是让我们想要做一些我们知道不应该做的事情。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.<br>然后我们有了形容词 方便。方便的东西很容易使用。例如，呼叫电梯的按钮位于非常方便的高度，可以很容易地触及。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.<br>康纳教授接着谈到了我们坐立不安的本能。作为人类，我们喜欢坐立不安，我们喜欢四处走动，我们不能长时间保持静止，我们喜欢用手做事。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.<br>教授谈到我们是数字生物，这意味着有手指的生物 —— 数字是手指或脚趾的另一种说法。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And finally we had grooming.<br>最后我们进行了梳理。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.<br>这是通过清洁、洗头和做头发来让自己看起来漂亮的习惯。这是一些动物（例如猿类）为彼此做的事情。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>What do you remember of your teenage years?</p><p>Rob<br>Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.</p><p>Rob<br>So whose fault is it?</p><p>Neil<br>Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?</p><p>Rob <br>Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.</p><p>Neil<br>I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore<br>The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.</p><p>Neil <br>So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?</p><p>Rob<br>Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.</p><p>Neil<br>And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?</p><p>Rob<br>No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.</p><p>Neil<br>What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.</p><p>Neil<br>So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore<br>The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.</p><p>Neil<br>So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.</p><p>Neil<br>So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!</p><p>Rob<br>Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?</p><p>Rob<br>I guessed c) 1950s</p><p>Neil<br>The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary.</p><p>Rob<br>Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period.</p><p>Neil<br>So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence.</p><p>Rob <br>Exactly.</p><p>Neil<br>Papers is the word for published scientific research.</p><p>Rob<br>Dogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged.</p><p>Neil<br>The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks.</p><p>Rob<br>And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions.</p><p>Neil<br>Well my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish.</p><p>Rob<br>Well, your skills are working well Neil. We may be going now but you don’t need to – you can listen or watch us again and find lots more learning English materials on our social media platforms. You can also visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com.</p><p>Neil<br>See you soon, goodbye. </p><p>Rob <br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What do you remember of your teenage years?<br>你还记得你的青少年时代吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?<br>哦，我简直是一场噩梦。我对父母很粗鲁，总是在外面呆到很晚，从不做作业，和错误的人一起出去玩，做了很多错误的决定。你呢，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.<br>嗯，真的差不多。人们总是这样说青少年，不是吗？他们经历了一段失控和行为不端的时期。但显然，这不是他们的错。至少不是直接的。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>So whose fault is it?<br>那么是谁的错呢？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?<br>显然是我们的大脑。青少年的大脑仍在控制行为的区域发育，这可能意味着你不能责怪他们的行为方式。在我们了解更多信息之前，让我们先提出我们的问题。一直都有青少年，但“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的呢？是： a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 有什么想法吗，罗伯？</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.<br>嗯，我认为它大约出现在摇滚乐时代，所以那应该是 1950 年代。这是我的猜测。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?<br>我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。来自伦敦大学学院的 Sarah-Jayne Blakemore 专门研究大脑的运作，尤其是青少年的大脑。最近，她是 BBC 广播节目 The Life Scientific 的嘉宾。她解释说，关于大脑在青少年时期仍在发育的理解是相当新的。她说第一项研究是什么时候出来的？</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)<br>The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.<br>第一项研究表明，人脑在整个青春期和 20 多岁都经历了这种非常实质性和显着的发展；第一批论文发表于 90 年代后期。在此之前，例如当我上大学时，教科书中的教条是，绝大多数大脑发育发生在生命的最初几年，童年中期之后就没有什么太大的变化了。这个教条是完全错误的。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?<br>那么，对青少年大脑的研究是什么时候出来的呢？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.<br>令人惊讶的是，直到 1990 年代后期才出现。就在这时，她说关于这个主题的第一批论文发表了。在这种情况下，论文是指已发表的科学研究成果。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?<br>她实际上并没有谈论青少年，对吧？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.<br>不，没错。她谈到了青春期。这个名词，青春期，是一个人从儿童发展成成人的时期，它或多或少与青少年时期相同。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.<br>我发现有趣的是，在 1990 年代之前，人们认为我们的大脑发育方式有所不同。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.<br>是的，布莱克莫尔教授说，当时的教条是，我们的大脑大多在儿童早期就已经完全发育，早在青春期之前。教条是一个词，用于描述人们被期望接受为真理的强烈信念。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?<br>因此，我们的大脑发育仍然比最初认为的要晚得多。这告诉我们关于青少年行为的什么信息？特别令人感兴趣的是大脑的一个重要部分，称为前额叶皮层。布莱克莫尔教授又来了。她能给那些没有按时完成作业的青少年找什么借口呢？</p><p>Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)<br>The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.<br>前额叶皮层是大脑中位于前额正后方的部分，它参与了一系列非常高级的认知任务，例如决策和规划 —— 我们知道这个区域在青少年时期正在经历非常非常大量的发育。因此，就我们对青少年的期望而言，例如，计划他们的家庭作业，考虑到我们知道大脑中关键参与计划的区域还没有发育，这可能太高了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?<br>所以前额叶皮层在认知任务中很重要。那些是什么，罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.<br>认知任务是需要有意识地思考和处理的任务，例如做出决策和规划。它不会自动发生，您必须考虑它。所以在青少年时期，大脑的这一部分还没有完全发育。请注意我们早期青春期的名词的形容词形式。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!<br>所以这给了你不做功课的好借口！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.<br>哈，哈，我真希望我早就知道了。我曾经说我把作业忘在了公共汽车上，或者狗吃了它。现在我可以说，’对不起，先生，我的大脑还不够发达，无法完成计划家庭作业的认知任务’。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?<br>是的，我确定那会奏效！在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。我问“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的人？你说是：a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I guessed c) 1950s<br>我猜 c） 1950 年代</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary.<br>答案实际上是 b） 1930 年代。如果你知道这一点，那就太好了。现在快速回顾一下今天的词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period.<br>青春期是从儿童到成人变化时期的名词，形容词是青少年 —— 同一个词也是处于那个青少年时期的人的名词。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence.<br>因此，青少年可能要对他或她的青春期行为负责。</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Exactly.<br>完全。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Papers is the word for published scientific research.<br>Papers 是已发表的科学研究的词。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Dogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged.<br>教条是坚定不移的信念，不受挑战。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks.<br>前额叶皮层是大脑中处理认知任务的重要组成部分。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions.<br>认知任务是需要积极思考和考虑的心理过程，例如计划和做出决定。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish.<br>好吧，我的决策能力告诉我，是时候完成了。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, your skills are working well Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Rob<br>And I’m Rob.</p><p>Neil<br>We’re going to be looking at a letter from the English alphabet. It’s a letter which has a particular meaning when used at the end of a piece of informal writing such as letters, emails, texts and messages.</p><p>Rob<br>I’m very EXcited.</p><p>Neil<br>Ha ha, very good, very good Rob!</p><p>Rob<br>My EXpectations are really high.</p><p>Neil<br>Yep, that’s another good one.</p><p>Rob<br>Is it an EXtraordinary letter?</p><p>Neil<br>OK, thank you Rob, that’s enough of your jokes. I’m getting EXasperated! Oh, now you’ve got me at it! Well, no prizes for guessing what letter we’re focussing on today?</p><p>Rob <br>Why?</p><p>Neil<br>No, it’s not Y.</p><p>Rob <br>No, no. I didn’t mean the letter ‘y’, I meant the word ‘why’, as in - why are there no prizes?</p><p>Neil<br>Because of all the not so subtle clues you’ve been giving. The letter is X.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes. Exactly.</p><p>Neil<br>Alright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let’s have a question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? Any ideas Rob?</p><p>Rob <br>An excellent question but quite obscure, I’m going to say b) Hindi.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, I’ll have the answer later on. Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.</p><p>Neil<br>Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from?</p><p>Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge <br>Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans…</p><p>Presenter:<br>That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there.</p><p>Presenter:<br>It has, clunk.</p><p>Neil <br>What do we learn about the origins of the X for kisses?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, it’s been used since at least 1763 and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks.</p><p>Neil<br>And why did this come to mean a kiss?</p><p>Rob<br>Well, Dr Wright suggests it’s because of the original pronunciation - &#x2F;ks&#x2F;.</p><p>Neil<br>And at the point the presenter made the connection, didn’t he?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he did. And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped.</p><p>Neil<br>And this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk.</p><p>Rob<br>Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example.</p><p>Neil<br>Let’s listen to that exchange again.</p><p>Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge <br>Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763.

I think a penny’s just dropped there.</p><p>Presenter:<br>It has, clunk.</p><p>Neil<br>One thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something you do for everyone. It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?</p><p>Professor Nils Langer, University of Bristol<br>A colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs.</p><p>Presenter:<br>They docked her another 20 quid, I think!</p><p>Neil<br>What was her mistake, Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>She didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax.</p><p>Neil<br>We don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound.</p><p>Neil <br>Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian?</p><p>Rob<br>I guessed b) Hindi.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme.</p><p>Rob<br>We started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling.</p><p>Neil<br>The phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something</p><p>Rob <br>A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other.</p><p>Neil<br>The Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority.</p><p>Rob<br>If you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary.</p><p>Neil<br>And finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it’s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, goodbye. </p><p>Rob <br>Bye bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello.

Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?<br>好吧，我稍后会给出答案。现在，罗伯，消息末尾的字母 X 本身是什么意思？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.<br>嗯，意思是一个吻。亲吻越多，你表现出的爱意就越多。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from?

We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs.<br>我一个来自布里斯托尔的同事，当她从德国过来时，她认为 X 只是在英国结束一封信的正常方式，因此她会用 X 结束任何一封信，甚至是一封给税务局的信。我们从未真正听说过税务局如何用这些 X 来回应这些信件。</p><p>Presenter:(主持人：)<br>They docked her another 20 quid, I think!<br>我想，他们又给她停了 20 英镑！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>What was her mistake, Rob?<br>她犯了什么错误，罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>She didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax.<br>她没有意识到你不会在每一次通信上都打 X。因此，她甚至将其写在商业信函上，包括一封给英国税务局的政府部门。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>We don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been.<br>我们不知道税务人员对这封带有亲吻的信有何感想。但主持人开玩笑说他们的反应会是什么。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound.<br>是的，他开玩笑说他们可能又给她停了 20 英镑。To dock money 是减少您期望收到的金额，而 quid 是英镑的俚语。</p><p>Neil (尼尔 )<br>Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian?<br>现在是我们问题的答案了。英语有 26 个字母。哪种语言有 74 个字母？是吗。。。a） 高棉语（柬埔寨语） b） 印地语或 c） 亚美尼亚语？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I guessed b) Hindi.<br>我猜 b） 印地语。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme.<br>嗯，我想这是三分之一的机会，但这次不是正确的。答案是 a） 高棉语。如果你知道这一点，那就太好了。现在让我们来看看这个节目中我们看的词汇。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>We started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling.<br>我们从 penny 开始。一便士是一枚英国硬币。一百便士等于一英镑。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something<br>短语 the penny has dropped，意思是某人突然明白了某事</p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other.<br>咔嚓声是两个重物相互撞击的声音。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>The Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority.<br>Inland Revenue 是英国的税务机关。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>If you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary.<br>如果您从某人那里收取资金，则会减少您支付给他们的金额。例如，作为英国的员工，您的税款会自动从您的工资中扣除。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it’s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, goodbye. <br>最后是 quid，这是一英镑的俚语。好了，在他们开始扣我们迟到的工资之前，是时候说再见了。在 Instagram、Facebook、Twitter、YouTube 上找到我们，我们的应用程序，当然还有 bbclearningenglish.com 的网站。再见，再见。 </p><p>Rob (罗伯 )<br>Bye bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><img src="/2018/12/06/wechat-2018-12-06/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片14.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="a-penny"><a href="#a-penny" class="headerlink" title="a penny"></a>a penny</h4><p>a coin (100 pennies &#x3D; 1.00 GBP)<br>一分钱<br>a coin (100 pennies &#x3D; 1.00 GBP) 一枚硬币（100便士&#x3D;1.00英镑）<br>He didn’t have a penny to his name.<br>他身无分文。</p><h4 id="clunk"><a href="#clunk" class="headerlink" title="clunk"></a>clunk</h4><p>the noise of two heavy objects coming together<br>当啷声<br>the noise of two heavy objects coming together 两个沉重的物体撞击在一起的声音<br>The heavy box clunked to the ground.<br>沉重的箱子当啷一声掉到了地上。</p><h4 id="Inland-Revenue"><a href="#Inland-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Inland Revenue"></a>Inland Revenue</h4><p>the government department in the UK which deals with taxes<br>英国税务海关总署<br>the government department in the UK which deals with taxes 英国负责税收的政府部门<br>He owed a considerable sum to the Inland Revenue.<br>他欠税务海关总署一大笔钱。</p><h4 id="to-dock"><a href="#to-dock" class="headerlink" title="to dock"></a>to dock</h4><p>to reduce the amount of money someone receives in their salary or wages, for example as a tax payment<br>扣除<br>to reduce the amount of money someone receives in their salary or wages, for example as a tax payment 从某人的薪水或工资中扣除一部分钱，例如作为税款支付<br>His wages were docked for lateness.<br>他因迟到而被扣工资。</p><h4 id="a-quid"><a href="#a-quid" class="headerlink" title="a quid"></a>a quid</h4><p>slang term for 1.00 GBP<br>一英镑<br>slang term for 1.00 GBP 一英镑（俚语）<br>It cost me a quid.<br>这花了我一英镑。</p><h4 id="the-penny-has-dropped"><a href="#the-penny-has-dropped" class="headerlink" title="the penny has dropped"></a>the penny has dropped</h4><p>someone suddenly realises or understands something<br>恍然大悟<br>someone suddenly realises or understands something 某人突然意识到或理解某事<br>The penny dropped when I realised what he was saying.<br>当我意识到他在说什么时，我恍然大悟。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

There’s only one thing better than talking about food and that’s eating it.</p><p>Neil<br>Well I know you are a bit of a gastronome – someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – but today we’re talking about photographing food, not eating it.</p><p>Rob<br>That is a shame because I am on a see-food diet – if I see food, I have to eat it. Get it?!</p><p>Neil<br>Yes Rob, very very funny. But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food not eating it is big business as I will explain shortly. But shall we feast on a question first Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>Yes, if it tastes good!</p><p>Neil<br>It does. So, do you know the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef</p><p>Rob<br>Hmm, I’m not a chef expert but I’ll say c) a Sous Chef – it sounds important!</p><p>Neil<br>Well I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes.</p><p>Rob<br>And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant.</p><p>Neil<br>Which isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it!</p><p>Rob<br>You could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product.</p><p>Neil<br>Maybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?</p><p>Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar Chick<br>It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose.</p><p>Neil<br>Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything.</p><p>Neil<br>And that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food.</p><p>Rob<br>Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant.</p><p>Neil<br>Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens…</p><p>Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of Oxford<br>We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience.</p><p>Neil<br>Right so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food.</p><p>Rob<br>And expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen.</p><p>Neil<br>Right Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a)  Pastry chef b)  Commis chef c)  Sous chef What did you say, Rob?</p><p>Rob<br>I said c) a Sous chef. Am I right?</p><p>Neil<br>You are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen!</p><p>Rob<br>Come on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me!</p><p>Neil<br>Maybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think.</p><p>Rob<br>We also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>Absolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it?</p><p>Rob<br>Very nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme!</p><p>Neil<br>Well let’s hope so!</p><p>Rob<br>Yes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms. See you soon, bye.</p><p>Neil<br>Bye!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.<br>大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I’m Rob.<br>我是 罗伯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And in this programme we’re discussing food.<br>在这个节目中，我们讨论的是食物。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Food glorious food! There’s only one thing better than talking about food and that’s eating it.<br>美食光彩夺目！只有一件事比谈论食物更好，那就是吃它。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well I know you are a bit of a gastronome – someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – but today we’re talking about photographing food, not eating it.<br>嗯，我知道你有点像个美食家 - 一个喜欢并了解高品质食物的人 - 但今天我们谈论的是拍摄食物，而不是吃它。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>That is a shame because I am on a see-food diet – if I see food, I have to eat it. Get it?!<br>这很遗憾，因为我正在吃东西 – 如果我看到食物，我就必须吃它。明白了吗？！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes Rob, very very funny. But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food not eating it is big business as I will explain shortly. But shall we feast on a question first Rob?<br>是的，罗伯，非常非常有趣。但是在社交媒体上瘾的世界里，仅仅看到食物不吃它是一件大事，我稍后会解释。但是，我们先吃一个问题好吗，罗伯？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes, if it tastes good!<br>是的，如果味道好的话！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>It does. So, do you know the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef<br>确实如此。那么，您知道通常在餐厅厨房中仅次于主厨并承担很多经营责任的人的名字吗？是……a） 糕点师 b） 助理厨师 c） 副厨师长</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Hmm, I’m not a chef expert but I’ll say c) a Sous Chef – it sounds important!<br>嗯，我不是厨师专家，但我会说 c） 副厨师长 – 听起来很重要！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes.<br>好吧，我将在节目的后面给出答案。现在让我更多地解释一下食物和照片。如今，一道菜（即准备食用的食物的名词）被拍摄得有多好，比它的实际味道更重要。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant.<br>我想社交媒体平台是分享美食照片的最佳方式，不是吗？我一直在用智能手机拍下我的食物照片而感到内疚 —— 但仅限于在一家豪华餐厅吃一些美味的食物时。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Which isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it!<br>我想这并不常见！但是通过在社交媒体上分享图片，人们看到它们并认为食物看起来很美味，我必须去那家餐厅吃！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>You could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product.<br>你可以说这是关于风格而不是内容，这意味着某物的外观比内容或产品更好。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Maybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?<br>也许吧，罗伯 – 尽管我敢肯定有时食物的味道和看起来一样好。无论如何，BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours 一直在调查这个问题。他们与几位有影响力的 Instagram 用户和博主进行了交谈 —— 有影响力意味着有能力让人们改变他们的想法。这是其中之一 – Rebecca Milford，她编辑了一个名为 Bar Chick 的网站。她如何看待这一新趋势？</p><p>Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar Chick(RebeccaMilford，BarChick编辑)<br>It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose.<br>一张图片胜过千言万语听起来很陈词滥调，但确实如此，我现在有朋友了，而不是像以前那样去餐厅的网站看看他们提供什么，然后你会去他们的 Instagram 帐户查看他们的图片， 然后根据你所看到的从字面上选择你想吃的东西。所以我想它必须像样。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words.<br>Rebecca 在那里使用了一句广为人知且使用广为人知的短语 —— 这个短语被使用得如此之多，以至于变得无聊 —— 我们称之为陈词滥调。这句话是一张图片胜过千言万语。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything.<br>是的 – 即使这是陈词滥调 – 它确实如此。您在一篇长博客中描述了一顿美妙的饭菜，但您可以从图片中快速看到它的外观，然后在脑海中创造一个关于它的味道的想法。因此，当您推广美食时，照片就是一切。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food.<br>这就是为什么一些餐馆向公关公司支付大量资金来拍摄可以在社交媒体上分享的时尚照片。这就像是一次美食的时尚摄影。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant.<br>是的，Rebecca 说食物必须像样 —— 看起来足够好，让人们看到 —— 因为人们会根据他们看到的东西做出选择。我还听说一些厨师和餐馆老板已经调整了他们的菜单，制作出在智能手机相机上看起来不错的饭菜。顺便说一句，餐馆老板是拥有和管理餐厅的人的名字。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens…<br>现在，虽然社交媒体账户（如 Instagram）上的好看食物可能与它的味道不匹配，但有一种理论可能会欺骗你，让你认为它确实很好吃。You and Yours 节目还听取了牛津大学实验心理学家 Charles Spence 教授关于这一切是如何发生的……</p><p>Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of Oxford(CharlesSpence，牛津大学实验心理学家)<br>We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience.<br>我们首先看到食物，或者玻璃杯中的饮料，我们的大脑已经在想象它的味道会是什么样子。它呈现得越精美，就越具有艺术性，这设定了更好的期望，它们在某种程度上延续并锚定了品尝体验。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Right so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food.<br>是的，一张很棒的食物照片可能会让我们觉得它的味道更好。我们在脑海中创造了一个关于食物味道的想法，这会影响我们实际食用食物时的期望。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>And expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen.<br>而期望意味着感觉好事将要发生。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Right Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef What did you say, Rob?<br>好的，罗伯，我相信你期待我之前给你的问题的答案。我问道，你是否知道通常在餐厅厨房中仅次于主厨并承担很多经营责任的人的名字？是……a） 糕点师 b） 助理厨师 c） 副厨师长 罗伯，你说什么？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>I said c) a Sous chef. Am I right?<br>我说 c） 副厨师长。我说得对吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen!<br>你是 罗伯！给那个人一份工作，也许在 BBC 食堂！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Come on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me!<br>来吧，尼尔，我想我可以做得更好！但在我这样做之前，让我们提醒自己我们今天讨论的一些词汇。从 gastronome 开始 - 那是一个喜欢并且对高品质食物非常了解的人 - 像我这样的人！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Maybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think.<br>也许吧，罗伯。我们还讨论了 influential 这个词，意思是有能力让人们改变他们的想法。</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>We also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil?<br>我们还提到了陈词滥调 —— 一个众所周知的短语，它被过度使用以至于变得无聊。例如，“一张图片胜过千言万语”。你从来不用陈词滥调，对吧，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Absolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it?<br>绝对不会。让我们继续讨论 Presentable – 它描述了看起来不错、很聪明并且足够让人们看到的东西。有点像我穿着我漂亮的新毛衣。喜欢吗？</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Very nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme!<br>很好！嗯，主持人必须得体，Neil！我们的下一个词是 expectation，这个词描述了好事即将发生的感觉。我期望人们会喜欢这个项目！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well let’s hope so!<br>好吧，让我们希望如此！</p><p>Rob(罗伯)<br>Yes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms. See you soon, bye.<br>是的，这就是这个节目的结尾。不要忘记查看我们的社交媒体平台。再见。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Bye!<br>再见！</p><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片1.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片2.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片3.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片4.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片5.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片6.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片7.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片8.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片9.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片10.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片11.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片12.PNG"><img src="/2018/11/29/wechat-2018-11-29/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.PNG" class="" title="幻灯片13.PNG"><h3 id="【核心词汇】"><a href="#【核心词汇】" class="headerlink" title="【核心词汇】"></a>【核心词汇】</h3><h4 id="gastronome"><a href="#gastronome" class="headerlink" title="gastronome"></a>gastronome</h4><p>someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food<br>美食家<br>喜爱并了解高级美食的人<br>He is a gastronome who appreciates fine wines and rare cheeses.<br>他是一位美食家，欣赏上等葡萄酒和稀有奶酪。</p><h4 id="influential"><a href="#influential" class="headerlink" title="influential"></a>influential</h4><p>having the power to make people change what they think<br>有影响力的<br>能够影响他人想法的人<br>His influential speech changed the course of the debate.<br>他那有影响力的演讲改变了辩论的进程。</p><h4 id="cliche"><a href="#cliche" class="headerlink" title="cliche"></a>cliche</h4><p>a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring<br>陈词滥调<br>使用过度而变得乏味的熟语<br>The ending of the movie was a predictable cliche.<br>这部电影的结尾是一个可预测的陈词滥调。</p><h4 id="presentable"><a href="#presentable" class="headerlink" title="presentable"></a>presentable</h4><p>looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see<br>体面的<br>外表好看，衣着整洁，足以见人<br>She made sure she was presentable for the interview.<br>她确保自己穿着得体去参加面试。</p><h4 id="restaurateur"><a href="#restaurateur" class="headerlink" title="restaurateur"></a>restaurateur</h4><p>person who owns and manages a restaurant<br>餐馆老板<br>拥有并经营餐馆的人<br>The restaurateur was known for his innovative menu.<br>这位餐馆老板以其创新的菜单而闻名。</p><h4 id="expectation"><a href="#expectation" class="headerlink" title="expectation"></a>expectation</h4><p>the feeling that something good is going to happen<br>期望<br>对好事即将发生的期待<br>The anticipation far exceeded expectation.<br>期待远远超过了预期。</p><p>在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！</p>]]></content>

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.</p><p>Catherine<br>And I’m Catherine.</p><p>Neil<br>Catherine, I’m going to start this programme with a quick test, just for you.</p><p>Catherine<br>Ooo, I love tests!</p><p>Neil<br>Complete this phrase: Wake up and smell the…</p><p>Catherine<br>Coffee Neil! It’s coffee. I have to say, I love coffee, it’s great.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, so do you drink much?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, just a couple of cups, you know.</p><p>Neil<br>Every day?</p><p>Catherine<br>No, every hour! I love coffee, don’t you like coffee, Neil?</p><p>Neil<br>I do but maybe not as much as you! What’s the best thing about it?</p><p>Catherine<br>It’s the smell. It’s got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it’s great isn’t it?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well no, not really. It’s always a little disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one.</p><p>Neil<br>OK, you’ve had quite a lot of coffee today, haven’t you?</p><p>Catherine<br>Just the usual six cups.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today’s question. The world’s biggest producer of coffee is…</p><p>Catherine<br>Brazil! Brazil!</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, yes, but that’s not the question. The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia</p><p>Catherine<br>Right, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right?</p><p>Neil<br>OK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is?</p><p>Tim Hayward, Coffee shop owner<br>It’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses.</p><p>Neil<br>So how important is it?</p><p>Catherine<br>I’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important.</p><p>Neil<br>And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me.</p><p>Neil<br>Can you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go?</p><p>Catherine<br>Yes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.</p><p>Neil<br>Don’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience?</p><p>Catherine<br>The effect of the lid?</p><p>Neil<br>Yes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids.</p><p>Tim Hayward<br>What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.</p><p>Neil<br>So what is he describing there?</p><p>Catherine<br>I see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again.</p><p>Tim Hayward<br>What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.</p><p>Neil<br>That was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward. Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said?</p><p>Catherine<br>I said it was a: Colombia.</p><p>Neil<br>Ah, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine.</p><p>Catherine<br>So the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential.</p><p>Neil<br>Next we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee.</p><p>Catherine<br>Something that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it.</p><p>Neil<br>You might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange.</p><p>Catherine<br>And finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name.</p><p>Neil<br>Well that is the end of our programe. For more from us, check out Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye.</p><p>Catherine<br>Bye! Fancy a coffee?</p><p>Neil<br>I think you’ve had too much!</p><h3 id="【中英文双语脚本】"><a href="#【中英文双语脚本】" class="headerlink" title="【中英文双语脚本】"></a>【中英文双语脚本】</h3><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Hello.

It’s coffee. I have to say, I love coffee, it’s great.<br>咖啡尼尔！这是咖啡。我不得不说，我喜欢咖啡，这太棒了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, so do you drink much?<br>好的，你喝很多吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Well, just a couple of cups, you know.<br>嗯，就几杯，你知道的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Every day?<br>每天？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>No, every hour! I love coffee, don’t you like coffee, Neil?<br>不，每小时一次！我喜欢咖啡，你不喜欢咖啡吗，尼尔？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>I do but maybe not as much as you! What’s the best thing about it?<br>我有，但可能没有你那么多！它最好的地方是什么？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>It’s the smell. It’s got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it’s great isn’t it?<br>是气味。一定是气味。你知道，当你打开数据包时，它很棒，不是吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?<br>是的，但它的味道从来没有像闻起来那么好，不是吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Well no, not really. It’s always a little disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one.<br>嗯，不，不是真的。这总是有点令人失望。我活在希望中，再来一杯，我觉得会更好。我实际上可能会更换品牌并尝试不同的品牌。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, you’ve had quite a lot of coffee today, haven’t you?<br>好了，你今天喝了不少咖啡，不是吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Just the usual six cups.<br>只是通常的六杯。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today’s question. The world’s biggest producer of coffee is…<br>嗯，我们今天的话题是咖啡的味道，咖啡也是今天问题的主题。世界上最大的咖啡生产商是……</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Brazil! Brazil!<br>巴西！巴西！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, yes, but that’s not the question. The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia<br>是的，是的，但这不是问题。问题是，巴西是最大的咖啡生产国，而巴西是第二大咖啡生产国？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Right, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right?<br>是的，这不是巴西，但我敢打赌这是另一个南美国家，所以我会去哥伦比亚。哥伦比亚，对吗？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>OK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is?<br>好的，我们将在节目的后面有答案，到那时，也许咖啡因已经离开了你的身体，凯瑟琳。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 是一位咖啡店老板。他出现在 BBC Radio 4 节目 The Kitchen Cabinet 中。他说咖啡的味道有多重要？</p><p>Tim Hayward, Coffee shop owner(TimHayward，咖啡店老板)<br>It’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses.<br>这绝对至关重要，这是关键。当你早上走进咖啡店时，那股气味袭来，你就会产生生理反应。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So how important is it?<br>那么它有多重要呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>I’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important.<br>我现在感觉平静了一些。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 说，咖啡的气味至关重要。这意味着它非常重要，也许是最重要的事情。他支持这一点，说这是关键。关键是必不可少的东西，它真的很重要。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?<br>他说，当你体验到这种气味时，当气味袭来时，你会得到一种生理反应。这句话的意思是你的身体对咖啡的气味有反应。也许你的嘴巴开始在期待中流口水。Catherine，当你喝咖啡时，你通常会把它放在那儿还是带走？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Well, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me.<br>嗯，我通常会把它带走，但如果我真的觉得需要一杯咖啡，我可能会在那里喝一杯，然后再买一杯带走。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Can you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go?<br>您能描述一下当您喝咖啡外带时给您的容器吗？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Yes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.<br>是的，它装在一个带盖的高纸杯里。盖子上有一个洞，这样我就可以喝那杯可爱的咖啡了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Don’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience?<br>你不觉得这是个问题吗？我的意思是，我们知道气味有多重要，那么盖子对这种体验有什么影响呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>The effect of the lid?<br>盖子的效果？</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids.<br>是的。好吧，这是 Tim Hayward 再次谈论带盖咖啡。</p><p>Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)<br>What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.<br>让我感到困惑的是，有多少大型咖啡连锁店实际上销售的是带有去除气味的杯子产品。所以你走进咖啡店，你会闻到气味，但当你真正把饮料拿出来时，你是在用一种旨在将热液体直接通过你的舌头，但阻止任何气味进入你的鼻子的东西喝它。这太奇怪了。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So what is he describing there?<br>那么他在那里描述了什么呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>I see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience.<br>我现在明白了，是的，他说的是大型咖啡连锁店。连锁店是一家在城镇和城市拥有大量门店的公司，有时遍布世界各地。我想我们都能想到几家知名的咖啡连锁店。他说，通过在外卖杯上盖上盖子，你实际上是在阻挡气味 —— 这种气味对咖啡体验非常重要。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again.<br>是的，他说他觉得这很奇怪，这是他觉得不寻常的一种方式，认为这很奇怪，很奇怪。以至于他说这让他感到困惑。如果你对某件事感到困惑，你会觉得它很困惑，你无法真正理解它。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 又来了。</p><p>Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)<br>What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose.

Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said?<br>那是咖啡店老板蒂姆·海沃德（Tim Hayward）。在我们又来了解本周的词汇之前，让我们来了解一下这个问题的答案。在巴西之后，哪个国家的咖啡产量最多？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚 凯瑟琳，你说的？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>I said it was a: Colombia.<br>我说是：哥伦比亚。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Ah, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine.<br>啊，对不起，今天没有额外的咖啡给你！答案是越南。现在我们来看一下词汇。把它带走凯瑟琳。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>So the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential.<br>所以第一个词是 vital，这是一个形容词，意思是非常重要。另一个含义非常相似的词是 key，意思是必不可少的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Next we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee.<br>接下来，我们有 physiological responses 这个短语。生理是指我们的身体所做的事情，而反应是一种反应。因此，生理反应是您的身体对某物的反应，例如咖啡的气味。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>Something that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it.<br>让你困惑、困惑、你不理解的东西。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>You might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange.<br>你可能会发现一些让你感到困惑的事情很奇怪。这个形容词的意思是不寻常或奇怪。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟琳)<br>And finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name.<br>最后，连锁店是来自同一家公司、同名的一组商店。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well that is the end of our programe.

A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work!</p><p>Neil<br>But where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock.</p><p>Margaret Heffernan<br>He compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work.</p><p>Neil<br>Which flock was most successful?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful.</p><p>Neil<br>Yes, but why was that?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them.</p><p>Neil<br>So, what do we learn from this experiment?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers.</p><p>Neil<br>But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again.</p><p>Margaret Heffernan<br>So chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them.</p><p>Neil<br>So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves.</p><p>Neil<br>Pecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate?</p><p>Catherine<br>Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens.</p><p>Neil<br>Right, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine?</p><p>Catherine<br>I said 371.</p><p>Neil<br>Well, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right!</p><p>Catherine<br>That’s a lot of eggs!</p><p>Neil<br>Indeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance.</p><p>Catherine<br>An expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy.</p><p>Neil<br>A group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens.</p><p>Catherine<br>Another of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done.</p><p>Neil<br>And if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be.</p><p>Catherine<br>And finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people. For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel.</p><p>Neil<br>Well that is the end of the programme.

A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work!<br>答案是肯定的！等级制度是一种组织人员的方式。例如，在一家公司中，有不同级别的人。你有老板、经理和工人。工人做工作，经理开会阻止工人做工作！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine?<br>但是鸡从哪里来呢？我们很快就会知道，但首先是今天的问题，它是 —— 惊喜，惊喜 —— 关于鸡。一只鸡一年产下的创纪录的鸡蛋数量是多少？是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你怎么看 凯瑟琳？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371.<br>嗯，我认为大多数鸡每天下一次蛋，所以我认为是 371。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock.<br>好吧，我们将在节目的后面给出答案。现在，对于层次结构和鸡。在 Somethin’ Else 为 BBC 制作的广播节目 The Joy of 9 to 5 中，企业家 Margaret Heffernan 描述了一项实验。在这个实验中，研究人员比较了一组普通鸡和一组超级鸡的产蛋量。那是产蛋量高于平均水平的鸡。哪个最成功？这是 Margaret Heffernan，顺便说一句，一群鸡的名词是一群鸡。</p><p>Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)<br>He compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work.<br>他将这两个羊群进行了六代的比较。普通的羊群变得越来越好。产蛋量急剧增加。超级鸡的超级群，在六代结束时，除了三个之外，其他都死了，因为其他三个已经杀死了其余的。他们通过压制其他人的生产力来实现自己的个人生产力。这就是我们在工作中所做的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Which flock was most successful?<br>哪个鸡群最成功？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful.<br>嗯，超级鸡群实际上是互相残杀的，所以事实证明，普通鸡群总共产下更多的蛋，而且更成功。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Yes, but why was that?<br>是的，但为什么呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them.<br>好吧，超级鸡一定把他们的其他鸡群成员看作不是同事，而是竞争对手。现在要理解这一点，我们必须从生产力这个词开始。这个名词指的是完成的工作量。因此，在个体层面上，超级鸡之所以能提高生产力，是因为它们抑制了鸡群成员的生产力。这里的 suppressed 意味着他们通过杀死其他鸡来“阻止其他鸡生产”。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, what do we learn from this experiment?<br>那么，我们从这个实验中学到了什么呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers.<br>Margaret Heffernan 认为，我们在人类工作场所看到了这种行为。当每个人都平等时，生产力会很高，但是一旦有等级制度 —— 只要有经理 —— 事情就会出错，因为并非所有经理都认为他们的角色是让员工的生活更轻松。他们通过干扰工人的生产力来展示他们作为管理者的生产力。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again.<br>但还有其他实验表明，鸡在等级制度中是有生产力的。不过，这些层次结构有何不同？玛格丽特·赫弗南 又来了。</p><p>Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)<br>So chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them.<br>所以鸡有一个内置的，或者如果你愿意的话，有一个继承的层次结构 - 这就是我们得到术语 啄食顺序 的地方。但这是他们自己创造的，而不是强加给他们的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?<br>那么，至少对鸡来说，哪种层次结构是有效的呢？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves.<br>嗯，最好的等级制度是没有强加的等级制度。这意味着良好的等级制度不会强加给鸡。自然，当他们自己创建层次结构时，他们会做得很好。他们自己制定啄食顺序。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Pecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate?<br>啄食顺序是一个很棒的短语。我们用它来描述组织中的重要性级别。你越重要，你的啄食顺序就越高。这句话从何而来？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens.<br>嗯，啄是指鸡用喙做什么。他们用它们打或咬其他鸡。而最重要或占主导地位的鸡，啄所有其他鸡。最上面的鸡会啄所有的东西，中等等级的鸡会被啄食并自己做一些啄食，有些鸡只被其他鸡啄食。所以，鸡的啄食顺序是明确的。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Right, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine?<br>好了，是时候复习本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解一下测验的答案。我问一只鸡一年产蛋的记录数量是多少。选项是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你说什么，凯瑟琳？</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>I said 371.<br>我说 371。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Well, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right!<br>好吧，你很幸运！你绝对是排名靠前的，不是吗？因为你是对的！</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>That’s a lot of eggs!<br>好多鸡蛋啊！</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>Indeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance.<br>事实上。现在，词汇。我们谈论的是等级制度 - 一种组织具有不同重要性的社会或工作场所的方式。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>An expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy.<br>具有相似含义的表达是 peking order，它与某人或一只鸡在层次结构中的重要性有关。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>A group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens.<br>一群鸡是一群鸡。它也是 birds 的通用集体名词，而不仅仅是 chickens。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>Another of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done.<br>我们的另一个词是名词 productivity，它指的是完成的工作量。</p><p>Neil(尼尔)<br>And if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be.<br>如果你压制某人的生产力，你就会阻止他们尽可能地提高他们的生产力。</p><p>Catherine(凯瑟 琳)<br>And finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people.
