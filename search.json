This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Pippa. GeorgieAnd I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop? PippaI think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie? GeorgieI’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks. PippaOh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650 GeorgieThe most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650. PippaWell, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping. GeorgieBut BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something. PippaThe founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet. Alicia WestonPeople in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK. GeorgieAlicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time. Alicia WestonSo ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home. PippaAlicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened. GeorgieAlicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice. PippaTo give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats. Amy, mentorRemember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted] AllyLove this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy. GeorgiaI’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it. AllyI’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time. GeorgieThe mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic. PippaAmy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do. GeorgieOne of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy! PippaBags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world. GeorgieYes, I said a meal was €2,650. PippaWell, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive. GeorgieIt definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something. PippaWe can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events. GeorgieIf you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution. PippaIf we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality. GeorgieIf something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do. PippaAnd if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting! GeorgieOh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website. Visit bbclearningenglish.com. PippaBye for now. GeorgieBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Pippa(皮帕)I’m Pippa.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Pippa。 Georgie(乔治)And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?我是 Georgie。在这个计划中，我们谈论的是节省食物费用。Pippa，你擅长在食品店省钱吗？ Pippa(皮帕)I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?我觉得我挺好的。我计划我喜欢做什么，这样我就不会在超市浪费钱。你呢，Georgie？ Georgie(乔治)I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.我不是很好。我通常在饿的时候去超市，所以我最终买了很多零食。 Pippa(皮帕)Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650哦，这真是个糟糕的主意。好吧，在这个计划中，我们将学习一种在我们吃的食物上省钱的方法。但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Georgie。世界上最昂贵的餐厅被认为是伊维萨岛一家名为 Sublimotion 的餐厅，每晚只有 12 名顾客。但是，在餐厅每人吃一顿饭要多少欧元呢？a） 650 欧元 b） 1,650 欧元 c） 2,650 欧元 Georgie(乔治)The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.最昂贵的…我选择 c） 2,650 欧元。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，英国的食品越来越贵，就像在世界许多地方一样，有些人正在努力负担食品购物的费用。 Georgie(乔治)But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.但 BBC 世界服务节目 People Fixing the World 一直在了解一个名为“Bags of Taste”的项目，该项目帮助人们节省购买食品的费用，同时改善他们的饮食。Bags of something 是一种非正式的方式，可以表达很多东西。 Pippa(皮帕)The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.Bags of Taste 的创始人 Alicia Weston 开始担心，在英国，钱少的人发现很难负担得起健康的饮食。 Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.贫困人口的饮食习惯最差，而且他们的年龄越来越大。我们知道，饮食是英国健康不平等的最大原因。 Georgie(乔治)Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.Alicia 发现人们不知道如何烹饪他们想吃的饭菜，而且他们负担不起实验的费用。想象一下，在食材上花了很多钱，然后通过煮得不好或烧焦食物来浪费它们。人们还认为制作健康食品太昂贵且花费太多时间。 Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.因此，最终，我们能够提出一个基本上可以解决所有这些问题的计划。所以我们现在做的是将所有原料送到他们家门口，因为归根结底，行为改变始于真正改变你在家里的行为。 Pippa(皮帕)Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.Alicia 说，最终，她已经能够想出一个解决方案来帮助人们在健康食品上省钱。我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally，在一系列事件发生之后。 Georgie(乔治)Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.Alicia 希望解决阻碍人们在预算内吃健康食品的问题。如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它。Alicia 的解决方案包括将食材和食谱交付给人们，然后使用 WhatsApp 群组与参与者交谈。每个 WhatsApp 群组都有一位导师，他会分享烹饪技巧和建议。 Pippa(皮帕)To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.为了让您了解其运作方式，People Fixing the World 的团队在其中一个 “Bags of Taste” WhatsApp 聊天中朗读了一些消息。 Amy, mentor(Amy，导师)Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]记得把冰箱袋放在冰箱里。我们能不能在星期二晚上之前做一个食谱？我们的第一个食谱 chana masala 是经典之作。它需要一个洋葱，切碎可能会很痛苦。所以，试试我们的方式。[视频发布] Ally(盟友)Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.喜欢这种方法 [厨师表情符号]。我第一次切这样的洋葱，它是如此整洁和简单。 Georgia(格鲁吉亚)I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.我明天要煮我的。期待它。 Ally(盟友)I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.我已经完成了我的 chana masala。我对辣椒有点太重了。我丈夫喜欢很多香料。所以，下次我会减少这个数字。 Georgie(乔治)The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.该小组的导师 Amy 将 chana masala 的食谱描述为经典之作。我们称某物为经典，以表示它是众所周知的且质量好。我们也可以将特定的书籍、电影或歌曲描述为经典。 Pippa(皮帕)Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.Amy 发送了一段视频，展示了一种切洋葱的技术，她将其描述为切洋葱很痛苦。如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那就很难做或令人讨厌。 Georgie(乔治)One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!其中一位参与者 Ally 说，当她制作 chana masala 时，她对辣椒有点粗暴。如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多，所以 Ally 的 chana masala 非常辣！ Pippa(皮帕)Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.Bags of Taste 帮助人们学习新食谱并烹饪健康食品，而无需花太多钱。在我的问题中，这肯定比在餐厅吃饭便宜得多，Georgie。我问你，在被认为是世界上最昂贵的餐厅 Sublimotion 吃一顿饭要多少钱。 Georgie(乔治)Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.是的，我说一顿饭是 2,650 欧元。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.好吧，你错了。它实际上是 1,650 欧元，但我认为这仍然相当昂贵。 Georgie(乔治)It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.绝对是。还行。让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 bags of 开始，这意味着很多东西。 Pippa(皮帕)We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally， after a series of events。 Georgie(乔治)If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它并找到解决方案。 Pippa(皮帕)If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.如果我们将某样东西（比如食谱）描述为经典，我们的意思是它是众所周知的并且质量好。 Georgie(乔治)If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那么它就是烦人或难以做到的。 Pippa(皮帕)And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多。例如，前几天我做了一些汤，盐有点重 —— 味道很恶心！ Georgie(乔治)Oh, that’s not very good!

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat? NeilWell, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes. BethWell, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice. NeilThat’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change. BethIn this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilBut first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres? BethI’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres. NeilWell, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain: Dr Yvonne PintoBetween 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties. BethRice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water. NeilOver half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide. BethSo, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short. NeilTo grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India: Jean-Philippe LabordeWe’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission. Ruth AlexanderAnd how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go? Jean-Philippe LabordeThat was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better. NeilMany Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works. BethAs it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question? NeilI asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold. BethVarieties of something are different types of it. NeilIf there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it. BethIf you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it. NeilTo give it a go means to try doing something. BethAnd finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable. Once again our six minutes are up. If you’ve enjoyed this programme, why not try practising the new vocabulary you’ve learned with our worksheet – it’s available to download now from our website, bbclearningenglish.com… and you could also try out the quiz while you’re there! Goodbye for now! NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?我是贝丝。Neil，您经常吃什么类型的食物？ Neil(尼尔)Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.嗯，让我吃饱的基本东西 —— 那种面包、土豆。 Beth(贝丝)Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.嗯，像这样很多人经常吃的食物，被称为主食。在英国，面包是一种流行的主食，但对于世界大部分地区来说，还有另一种食物是第一大食物：米饭。 Neil(尼尔)That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.没错。世界上超过一半的人口以大米为主食，尤其是在亚洲。但水稻是一种非常“缺水”的作物，需要大量的水才能生长，由于气候变化造成的干旱和洪水，这正在成为一个问题。 Beth(贝丝)In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.在本节目中，我们将听到一项开创性的新技术，该技术帮助农民在面对不断变化的气候时种植水稻。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到该程序的所有词汇，bbclearningenglish.com。 Neil(尼尔)But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。刚才我提到水稻是一种非常“口渴”的作物 —— 那么种植一公斤水需要多少水呢？是：a） 1,000 到 3,000 升吗？b） 3,000 至 5,000 升？或者，c） 5,000 至 7,000 升？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.我要说的是 c） 5,000 到 7,000 升。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。Yvonne Pinto 博士是位于菲律宾的国际水稻研究所（简称 IRRI）的总干事。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》解释了更多关于大米在全球流行的情况： Dr Yvonne Pinto(YvonnePinto医师)Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.世界上 50% 到 56% 的人口以大米为主要主食。现在，大约有 40 亿人，它是真正广泛种植的商品之一，尤其是在南亚和东南亚。但在非洲等大陆，人们对它的需求越来越大，当然也有拉丁美洲和欧洲的大米品种。 Beth(贝丝)Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.大米是一种商品，一种可以买卖的产品。与其他作物一样，大米也有多种类型，例如糙米、长粒米或印度樟米。今天对水稻的大部分研究都集中在培育能够适应不断变化的环境并在水过多或过少的条件下生长的新品种。 Neil(尼尔)Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.世界上超过一半的人口吃大米，非洲和欧洲的需求也在不断增长，因此很明显，全世界对大米都有胃口和强烈的愿望。 Beth(贝丝)So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.那么，是否有可能以更环保的方式种植水稻呢？大米公司 Tilda 的董事 Jean-Philippe Laborde 认为，答案在于一种称为交替湿式干燥（简称 AWD）的新种植技术。 Neil(尼尔)To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:为了种植水稻，农民会经历淹没田地或稻田的循环，然后稻田干涸，需要再次被淹没。使用 AWD 时，测量管被放置在地下 15 厘米处，以便农民可以检查田地任何部分的水位。通常，水稻需要 25 次洪水和干燥循环才能生长，但使用 AWD 可以减少到 20 次循环，从而为农民节省用水并减少甲烷排放。这是让-菲利普·拉博德 （Jean-Philippe Laborde） 告诉 BBC 国际频道《食物链》的主持人露丝·亚历山大 （Ruth Alexander） 他是如何开始对印度农民进行 AWD 实验的： Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.去年，我们有 1,268 名农民应用了这种 AWD 技术来减少甲烷总排放量。 Ruth Alexander(露丝·亚历山大)And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?您是如何说服那些农民试一试的？ Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.这相当具有挑战性，因为显然，对于农民来说，主要挑战是担心失去收入。他们需要在作物结束时看到切实的结果……他们显然得到了更好的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.许多印度农民都加入了让-菲利普的实验。如果您参与某事，即表示您同意行动计划并参与其中。换句话说，你试一试 – 你尝试做一些事情，看看它是否有效。 Beth(贝丝)As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?事实证明，新技术产生了切实的结果，结果是真实且可衡量的。使用 AWD，种植水稻所需的水和电量减少，甲烷气体排放量减少，最重要的是，水稻产量增加……对，Neil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Neil(尼尔)I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.我问种植 1 公斤水需要多少升水，答案是 3,000 到 5,000 升水，非常口渴，但并不像你想象的那么口渴。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从商品开始，一种可以买卖的产品，比如大米。 Beth(贝丝)Varieties of something are different types of it.某物的种类是它的不同类型的。 Neil(尼尔)If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.如果对某样东西有胃口，就会有强烈的愿望或需求。 Beth(贝丝)If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.如果你同意一个想法或计划，你就同意做某事并参与其中。 Neil(尼尔)To give it a go means to try doing something.To give it a go 的意思是尝试做某事。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. PippaAnd I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil? NeilIt makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa? PippaCats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy. NeilI’m not surprised. That sounds great. PippaSo, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH. NeilWe’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November? PippaI’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK. NeilOK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost. PippaFor many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry: Dr Ha Vinh ThoSo, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies. Charmaine CozierSo the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage. PippaBhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together. NeilUnlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled. PippaAs a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing. NeilBhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain. PippaSo in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy. NeilOriginally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry: Charmaine CozierThe project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain. Dr Lhawang UgyelThe intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work. PippaAs well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training. NeilThe idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people. PippaYes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil… NeilYes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is? PippaI said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK. NeilWell, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March. PippaNice. NeilAnd if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology. PippaA country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together. NeilThe adjective intact means complete and undamaged. PippaIf something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else. NeilA brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money. PippaAnd finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now! NeilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Pippa(皮帕)And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil?我是 Pippa。在这个节目中，我们谈论的是幸福。那么，是什么让你快乐呢，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)It makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa?当我和一群老朋友在一起，我们开怀大笑时，我很高兴。你呢，皮帕？ Pippa(皮帕)Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy.猫让我非常高兴。特别是如果我在街上看到一只我不认识的猫，它让我轻轻抚摸它。这总是让我很高兴。 Neil(尼尔)I’m not surprised. That sounds great.我并不感到惊讶。这听起来不错。 Pippa(皮帕)So, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH.所以，快乐对不同的人意味着不同的事情，但可以肯定的是，大多数人都希望快乐。喜马拉雅山上的不丹王国通过国民幸福总值 （GNH） 的理念将其提升到一个新的水平。 Neil(尼尔)We’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?我们很快就会听到更多关于 Gross National Happiness 的信息，并学习一些有用的新词汇，但首先 Pippa，我有一个问题要问你。当然，不仅仅是不丹人民想要快乐。事实上，联合国甚至宣布了国际幸福日。但那是什么时候呢？国际幸福日是：a） 3 月 20 日吗？b） 6 月 20 日？c） 11 月 20 日？ Pippa(皮帕)I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.我要说的是 6 月 20 日，因为英国会阳光明媚。 Neil(尼尔)OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.好的，让我们看看您是否在节目结束时。现在，简而言之，国民幸福总值意味着通过可持续和生态友好型发展来保护不丹的自然环境和文化。不丹政府认为这些目标比不惜一切代价发展经济更重要。 Pippa(皮帕)For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:多年来，不丹一直与外界隔绝 —— 第一批外国游客于 1974 年抵达，而电视直到 1999 年才被引入。不丹国王希望使国家现代化，并赋予其现代技术的好处，但又不损害传统文化，因此他邀请外部专家来发展国民幸福总值的想法。其中一位专家是 Ha Vinh Tho 博士，他在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 的主持人 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈： Dr Ha Vinh Tho(HaVinhTho医师)So, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.所以，他的想法是：’我们如何在不失去文化、环境和强大的社会结构的情况下实现国家的现代化和开放？因为不丹是亚洲唯一从未被殖民的国家之一，所以它的文化非常完整和充满活力，主要是佛教文化。因此，我们的想法是，国民幸福总值应该是所有政府决策和政策的重点。 Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.因此，公民的福祉和幸福成为中心议题。 Pippa(皮帕)Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.不丹拥有强大的社会结构，这意味着社区内部有良好的关系，这些关系将社会团结在一起。 Neil(尼尔)Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.与其他亚洲国家不同，不丹从未被殖民，因此其佛教文化和传统完好无损 —— 它们是完整且未受破坏的。 Pippa(皮帕)As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.因此，不丹人民的幸福成为中心，它成为最重要的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.不丹对幸福的重视受到了全世界的钦佩，但也存在问题。一个是不丹工人迁移到印度和其他国家，以寻找收入更高的工作和机会，这就是所谓的人才流失。 Pippa(皮帕)So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.因此，在 2023 年，不丹国王宣布了一项耗资数百万美元的项目，名为“正念之城”，这是一座基于精神和环境原则建造的新喜马拉雅城市，全部由可再生能源提供动力。 Neil(尼尔)Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:来自不丹的 Lhawang Ugyel 博士是该项目的主任，他与 BBC 国际频道的 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈， 调查. Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.该项目还旨在扭转不丹的人才流失。 Dr Lhawang Ugyel(LhawangUgyel医生)The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.目的是让当地人管理整个正念城市，所以从这个意义上说，这也是为了吸引已经离开的移民，他们在国外工作，获得了额外的技能，回到正念城市工作。 Pippa(皮帕)As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.除了是一个未来主义的生态城市外，正念之城还希望通过吸引工人回到不丹来阻止不丹的人才流失。然后，这些当地工人可以通过提升技能来使用他们在国外学到的额外技能。技能提升是通过培训提高工人技能的过程。 Neil(尼尔)The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.国民幸福总值的概念听起来可能很不寻常，但看到不丹平衡经济增长和人民幸福感是很有趣的。 Pippa(皮帕)Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…是的，这是真的 —— 这让我想起了你的问题，尼尔…… Neil(尼尔)Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?是的，我问你国际幸福日的日期是哪一天？ Pippa(皮帕)I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.我说那是英国夏天的 6 月 20 日。 Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.嗯，也许这对南半球的人们更好，因为现在是 3 月 20 日。 Pippa(皮帕)Nice.好。 Neil(尼尔)And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.如果您答对了，为什么不试试我们的互动测验，您可以在我们的网站上找到 bbclearningenglish.com！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 modernize 开始，让一些东西更现代，例如通过引入技术。 Pippa(皮帕)A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.一个国家的社会结构是指将一个社区联系在一起的关系。 Neil(尼尔)The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.形容词 intact 的意思是完整和未损坏。 Pippa(皮帕)If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.如果某件事占据中心位置，它就变得比其他任何事情都重要。 Neil(尼尔)A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.当大量受过教育和技能娴熟的人离开自己的国家到另一个可以赚更多钱的国家生活和工作时，就会发生人才流失。 Pippa(皮帕)And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!最后，技能提升意味着通过培训和经验来提高工人的技能。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！ Neil(尼尔)Goodbye!再见！ 【核心词汇】modernisemake more modern, for example through introducing new technology现代化使现代化，例如通过引进新技术The government invested heavily to modernise the country’s transport infrastructure.政府投入巨资来实现该国交通基础设施的现代化。 social fabriccommunity relationships which connect members of a society社会结构连接社会成员的社群关系Immigration can weaken the social fabric of a community.移民会削弱社区的社会结构。 intactcomplete and untouched完好无损完整且未被触及The church was destroyed during the war, but the altar somehow remained intact.教堂在战争中被摧毁，但祭坛不知何故完好无损。 take centre stagebecome more important than anything else成为焦点变得比任何事情都重要The issue of climate change is likely to take centre stage in the upcoming summit.气候变化问题很可能在即将举行的峰会上成为焦点。 brain drainwhen large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work abroad where they can earn more money人才流失大量受过良好教育和拥有技能的人离开自己的国家，到国外生活和工作，在那里他们可以赚到更多的钱The country is suffering a serious brain drain.这个国家正遭受严重的人才流失。 upskillingimproving workers’ skills by giving them additional training技能提升通过提供额外的培训来提高工人的技能The company invests heavily in upskilling its workforce.该公司在提升员工技能方面投入巨资。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】癌症疫苗很快就能成为现实吗？","path":"/2025/02/27/wechat-2025-02-27/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilHello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead. NeilVaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA. BethSo, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilNow I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox? BethI’m going to say polio. NeilOK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry: Dr Meredith McKeanThere’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade. BethDr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one. NeilCancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on. BethSo, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage. NeilSo, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry: Prof Eduardo SanchezBasically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system. BethIn cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way. NeilTo recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually. BethSo, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer? NeilI asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine? BethAnd I said polio. Was I right? NeilYou were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery. BethA number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say. NeilThe phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away. BethIf you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit. NeilBeing blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat. BethAnd finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon. Bye for now! NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.

Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.我是贝丝。在我们的一生中，每 5 人中就有 1 人会受到癌症的影响，癌症是一种细胞不受控制地生长并导致体内肿瘤的疾病。肿瘤可以是良性的，即非癌性，也可以是恶性的，即癌性，到 2022 年，全球估计有 970 万人死于恶性癌症。但在这个节目中，我们将专注于一些好消息。 Neil(尼尔)Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.疫苗是通过使人体免受某种疾病的免疫来保护人体的药物。现在，在开发一种名为 mRNA 的新疫苗方面，出现了一个突然而重要的发现 —— 一个突破。 Beth(贝丝)So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality?

And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.那么，癌症疫苗会很快成为现实吗？这就是我们将要发现的，以及学习一些有用的新单词和短语。请记住，如果您喜欢听六分钟英语并想同时阅读，您可以在我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com 上找到该节目的文字记录。 Neil(尼尔)Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?现在我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。我们已经提到了一些最新的疫苗，但第一个成功的疫苗治疗了哪种疾病？是：a） 流感？b） 脊髓灰质炎？或 c） 天花？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to say polio.我要说的是小儿麻痹症。 Neil(尼尔)OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:还行！好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。您可能想知道为什么身体的免疫系统不自动对抗癌症。原因是癌症有巧妙的方式躲避我们的自然防御，正如田纳西州肿瘤学研究主任 Meredith McKean 博士向 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 解释的那样： Dr Meredith McKean(MeredithMcKean博士)There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.有许多研究表明，癌症已经开发出不同的技术，能够发出信号或蛋白质，本质上是在癌细胞的表面，告诉免疫系统，’走开！这里没什么可看的！因此，它实际上是劫持了这些受体，基本上是告诉免疫系统放松刹车，在对抗癌症方面更加积极。这确实让免疫疗法在过去十年中取得了突破。 Beth(贝丝)Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.McKean 博士说，许多研究已经证明了癌症是如何扩散的。她使用短语 a number of 来表示几个，但这也使她的说法更有说服力，因为当然，几项研究总比一项好。 Neil(尼尔)Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.癌细胞通过假装是健康细胞来关闭免疫系统。就好像他们在说 Nothing to see here！– 一个非正式的短语，可以用来鼓励人们以俏皮的方式移动或移开某物，或者掩盖某物。例如，犯罪现场的警察可能会说，“这里没什么可看的！ Beth(贝丝)So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.所以，换句话说，癌症劫持了健康的细胞 —— 它控制了不属于它的东西，并利用它为自己谋取利益。 Neil(尼尔)So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:那么，疫苗将如何改变现状呢？好吧，现有的治疗方法，如化疗，积极地针对癌症，但也攻击健康组织，产生令人不快的副作用。另一方面，新的突破性疫苗重新训练免疫系统识别癌细胞并自然地消除这些细胞 —— 即使是已经患有这种疾病的患者。以下是德克萨斯州安德森癌症中心的爱德华多·桑切斯 （Eduardo Sanchez） 教授向 BBC 国际频道的 The Inquiry 解释的更多内容： Prof Eduardo Sanchez(EduardoSanchez教授)Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.基本上，癌细胞在告诉免疫系统，’不要攻击我，不要吃我’，对吧？免疫系统已经忘记了如何识别这些癌细胞，对识别癌细胞产生的那些畸变变得盲目，我们想用疫苗做的是重新教育免疫系统。 Beth(贝丝)In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.在癌症患者中，免疫系统对癌变的生长视而不见 —— 它完全没有注意到它们或意识到它们的危险，因此疫苗以不同的方式重新教育免疫系统或教它行为。 Neil(尼尔)To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.回顾一下，一些癌症治疗通过疏通我们受阻的自然防御来起作用，而疫苗则重新训练免疫系统以自然地发现和攻击癌细胞。由于这两种方法完全不同，因此它们可以一起使用，也可以单独使用。 Beth(贝丝)So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?所以，回答我最初的问题，Neil，癌症疫苗可能并不遥远。但是你的问题怎么样 —— 现在是不是该透露答案了？ Neil(尼尔)I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?我问哪种疾病首先被疫苗成功治疗？ Beth(贝丝)And I said polio. Was I right?我说的是小儿麻痹症。我是对的吗？ Neil(尼尔)You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.恐怕你错了。正确的选项是 C，即天花。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从突破开始，一个突然的、戏剧性的和重要的发现。 Beth(贝丝)A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.许多事物意味着几个或许多，可以增加你所说的可信度。 Neil(尼尔)The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.短语 Nothing to see here！用于阻止人们注意或过于仔细地观察某物，或将他们移开。 Beth(贝丝)If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.如果你劫持了什么东西，你就利用了不属于你的东西来为自己谋取利益。 Neil(尼尔)Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.对某事视而不见意味着没有注意到它或将其视为威胁。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it!

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people.

Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life. NeilWell, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time. BethWell, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilBut first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok? BethOh, I’m going to say TikTok. NeilWell, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World: Haleigh HurstI do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen. BethHaleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot. NeilBut of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men. BethMaanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World: Maanvi Sharma… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life… Kemi AdeyemiSome men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”. NeilMaanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise. BethAnd Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil. NeilI asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth? BethTikTok. NeilI’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening. BethIf you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much. NeilTo be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation. BethThe expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief. NeilIf you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them. BethAnd finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up!

NeilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life.我是贝丝。在这个节目中，我们将讨论社交媒体在年轻人生活中的积极和消极因素。这是目前一个非常热门的话题，因为澳大利亚正在讨论一项限制 16 岁以下儿童使用社交媒体的新法律。Neil，告诉我在你的生活中拥有社交媒体的一件好事和一件坏事。 Neil(尼尔)Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time.嗯，一件好事是我可以看到住在很远的朋友在做什么，一件坏事是它真的会让人上瘾，而且会浪费大量时间。 Beth(贝丝)Well, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.嗯，Neil 听听男性的观点很有趣，因为当谈到网络欺凌等问题时，受影响最大的往往是年轻女性，所以很快我们就会听到不同国家&#x2F;地区的女性讲述她们的在线经历。请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到所有词汇和工作表，bbclearningenglish.com。 Neil(尼尔)But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok?但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。2024 年，世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个？是：a） Facebook？b） Instagram？或 c） TikTok？ Beth(贝丝)Oh, I’m going to say TikTok.哦，我要说的是 TikTok。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，让我们从社交媒体的积极一面开始。作为俄克拉荷马大学（Oklahoma University）的一名政治专业学生，21岁的哈利·赫斯特（Haleigh Hurst）参加了2024年美国总统大选。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 解释了社交媒体的一个好处： Haleigh Hurst(哈利·赫斯特)I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.我确实认为社交媒体在教育年轻选民了解不同的政策和不同的竞选人方面发挥了巨大作用。我知道特朗普最近说，他心里对 TikTok 情有独钟。随着社交媒体的发展，它引发了更多的辩论。我想我们这一代人也见过很多高潮的事情发生。 Beth(贝丝)Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.Haleigh 认为社交媒体的一个好处是它引发了辩论和对话 —— 它导致辩论开始。她评论说唐纳德·特朗普是社交媒体的粉丝，他说他对TikTok情有独钟。如果你对某事或某人情有独钟，你会感到深情和喜欢它；你很喜欢它。 Neil(尼尔)But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.但当然，这并不是故事的全部。越来越多的年轻女性报告了社交媒体对她们生活的负面影响，以及她们在网上显得“完美”的压力，尤其是来自男性的压力。 Beth(贝丝)Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:Maanvi Sharma 现年 28 岁，是一名女商人和模特，在 Instagram 上拥有大量粉丝，居住在印度德里。Kemi Adeyemi 是一位来自尼日利亚拉各斯的 26 岁旅游博主。这两位年轻女性都在 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 中讨论了这些社交媒体上的担忧： Maanvi Sharma(马安维·夏尔马)… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life……你正在约会的人，他们可能会因为社交媒体而离开你。他们可能会认为你不适合，你知道的，像……你不能因为你在社交媒体上而成为一个好的伙伴，因为你被很多人看着，他们对此感到有点害怕……“你知道吗，我们看到了你的女朋友 —— 哦，我的天哪！她穿着这个，天哪！但它正在影响我的个人生活…… Kemi Adeyemi(凯米·阿德耶米)Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.有些人或有些人，他们希望你缩小自己，这样他们就可以成为更大的人。他们可以听你的朋友怎么说你，你的家人怎么说你，但他们无法站出来为你说，’哦，我认识这个人。我相信她不是因为其他原因做这些事情。 Neil(尼尔)Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.Maanvi 认为一些男人被她在 Instagram 上的受欢迎程度吓倒了。Intimidated 的意思是因为你缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。她感觉到人们会八卦她的帖子和照片，使用诸如“哦，我的天哪”和“哦，我的上帝”之类的表达来表达他们的震惊或惊讶。 Beth(贝丝)And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.凯米同意。她说，在社交媒体上，有些人希望她缩小自己，这句话的意思是你没有充分利用自己的潜力，以避免让人们感到不舒服，或者为了融入。当她在网上被欺负时，凯米说这些人不会为她挺身而出。To stand up for someone 的意思是为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持。我认为你是时候透露你问题的答案了，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?我问 2024 年世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个 —— Facebook、Instagram 还是 TikTok？你怎么说贝丝？ Beth(贝丝)TikTok.TikTok的。 Neil(尼尔)I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.恐怕你错了。它是 Facebook，拥有超过 30 亿的固定用户。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从动词 spark 开始，意思是导致某事开始发生，例如辩论或争论。 Beth(贝丝)If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.如果你对某人情有独钟，你就会对他们产生感情；你很喜欢他们。 Neil(尼尔)To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.To be intimidated 的意思是因为您对某种情况缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。 Beth(贝丝)The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.“Oh my gosh！”和“Oh my God！”这些表达是对强烈情绪的感叹，如震惊、惊讶、愤怒或不相信。 Neil(尼尔)If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.如果你缩小自己，你就会让自己变得更小，并且不会充分利用你的潜力来让别人感到舒适，或者为了适应他们。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme!

BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilIf you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more. BethBut now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. PhilGreat, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software? BethI am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook. PhilOK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily: Andrea JonesThe more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people. Megan LawtonAndrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […] Andrea JonesAs a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative. BethAndrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve. PhilIt doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage. BethSo, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily: Dr William BradyIf you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue. PhilInfluencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people. BethBiases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention. PhilSo, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer. BethOK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is. PhilI did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth? BethIt is, yes. PhilRight again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it. BethThe structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too. PhilTo incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent. BethThe adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage. PhilEyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme. BethAnd finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now! PhilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Phil.您好，这里是 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语，我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)If you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.如果你使用互联网，而且几乎每个人都使用互联网，你可能读过这样的头条新闻：你不会相信这位名人做了什么整容手术！像这样的标题被称为点击诱饵，用来吸引你的注意力并让你阅读更多内容。 Beth(贝丝)But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.但现在，一种称为愤怒诱饵的新趋势正在社交媒体上传播。愤怒诱饵是旨在让您生气或愤怒的在线内容。在这个节目中，我们将探索愤怒诱饵的趋势，并且像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些都可以在我们的网站上找到，bbclearningenglish.com。 Phil(菲尔)Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?很好，但首先是我的问题，贝丝，这是关于我们一直在使用的两个术语：“点击诱饵”和“愤怒诱饵”。两者都包含“诱饵”一词，但它的实际含义是什么？诱饵是否：a） 强烈的愤怒感？b） 用钩子钓鱼或动物的食物？c） 一个计算机软件？ Beth(贝丝)I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.我相当有信心它是 b） – 食物上钩。 Phil(菲尔)OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。愤怒诱饵的工作原理是这样的：创作者在网上发布挑衅性内容，可能是一条消息，或者一个视频。人们看到它，感到愤怒，并愤怒地评论。其他人看到它、喜欢它并分享它。无论哪种方式，内容都会引起兴趣，增加互联网流量并为创作者赚钱。以下是营销策略师 Andrea Jones 向 BBC 世界服务节目主持人 Megan Lawton 解释的更多内容： Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.他们创建的内容越多，他们获得的参与度就越高，他们获得的报酬就越多。所以他们会做任何事情……一些创作者会不惜一切代价获得更多观看次数，因为他们获得的观看次数越多，他们获得的报酬就越多，即使这些观看次数是负面的或煽动人们的愤怒和愤怒。 Megan Lawton(梅根·劳顿)Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]Andrea，愤怒诱饵与点击诱饵或其他在线策略有何不同？[…] Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.作为一名营销人员，我总是，你知道的，指导我的客户，并与他们讨论在他们的营销中使用钩子，对吧？我认为 hook 和 rage bait 甚至它失传已久的表亲 clickbait 内容之间的区别……当我们考虑一个钩子时，对我来说，钩子准确地反映了该内容中的内容，它来自一个信任的地方，而愤怒诱饵的内容则被设计为纵性的。 Beth(贝丝)Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.Andrea 说，帖子得到的反应越多，创作者赚的钱就越多，即使这些反应是仇恨的。她使用结构，一件事发生得越多，其他事情发生得越多，来表明当一件事反复发生时，另一件事也会因此而增加。例如，你练习英语的次数越多，你的进步就越大。 Phil(菲尔)It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.这些内容旨在煽动愤怒 —— 鼓励令人不快或暴力的反应，这并不重要。这就是为什么 Andrea 认为愤怒诱饵比点击诱饵更糟糕。虽然点击诱饵的内容更真实，但愤怒诱饵是纵性的，这意味着它试图影响某事以使其自身有利。 Beth(贝丝)So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:所以，不难看出为什么很多人认为愤怒诱饵是有毒的。所以，如果你想知道人们为什么首先会做出反应，请听听威廉·布雷迪博士向 BBC 世界服务部《商业日报》解释愤怒诱饵背后的心理学： Dr William Brady(WilliamBrady博士)If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.如果你是一个有影响力的人，你想弄清楚，’好吧，我如何在我的内容上获得更多的眼球？嗯，你需要利用我们在心理学中存在的那些偏见，因为那是我们将更加关注的内容。反过来，这就是算法将放大的内容，这最终意味着更多的广告收入。 Phil(菲尔)Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.有影响力的人希望他们的内容有更多的眼球 —— 更多的人查看他们的网站或社交媒体帖子 —— 并利用人类心理学来做到这一点。从心理学上讲，我们都有偏见 – 感觉 – 这些偏见通常是无意识的，要么支持要么反对某个想法或一群人。 Beth(贝丝)Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.偏见是情绪化的，由于倾听我们的情绪对人类物种的进化至关重要，创作者知道激发我们的情绪会吸引我们的注意力。 Phil(菲尔)So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.那么，可以做些什么来对抗愤怒诱饵呢？好吧，在做出反应之前，我们都可以花点时间思考一下。请记住，分享一些离谱的东西可能会让事情变得更糟，同时也会让创作者变得更富有。 Beth(贝丝)OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.好的，Phil，让我们揭示你问题的答案。你问我什么是“诱饵”。 Phil(菲尔)I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?我做了。正确答案是 b） 把食物挂在钩子上以捕捉鱼或动物，贝丝，你不是这么说的吗？ Beth(贝丝)It is, yes.是的，是的。 Phil(菲尔)Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.又对了！好，让我们回顾一下我们在该计划中学到的词汇，从愤怒诱饵开始，社交媒体内容旨在激起愤怒，从而鼓励人们参与其中。 Beth(贝丝)The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.结构，越多…越…描述一件事反复发生导致另一件事也发生的情况。 Phil(菲尔)To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.To agite someone 的意思是鼓励他们做或感受不愉快或暴力的事情。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.形容词 manipulative 描述了试图影响或控制某人以为自己谋取利益。 Phil(菲尔)Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.Eyeballs 是一个非正式词，指的是观看特定网站或电视节目的人数。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!最后，偏见是感觉，通常是无意识的，支持或反对一个想法或一群人。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！ Phil(菲尔)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】rage baitsocial media content designed to provoke an emotional reaction so that people engage with the content thereby generating income for the online creator愤怒诱饵旨在激起情绪反应的社交媒体内容，以便人们参与其中，从而为网络创作者带来收入。The inflammatory post was pure rage bait, designed to maximize engagement and profit.煽动性的帖子纯粹是愤怒诱饵，旨在最大限度地提高参与度和利润。 the more (X)… the more (Y)…as one thing (X) happens repeatedly, another thing (Y) happens more as a result越…越…一件事情(X)反复发生，另一件事情(Y)的结果就越多。The more he studied, the more confident he became in his abilities.他学习越多，就越自信。 inciteencourage someone to do or feel something unpleasant or violent; stir up; provoke; rouse煽动鼓励某人做或感受令人不快或暴力的事情；煽动；挑衅；激起。His inflammatory speech incited the mob to riot.他煽动性的演讲煽动了暴民暴动。 manipulativetrying to influence or control someone to your advantage操纵性的试图利用他人达到自己的目的。Her manipulative tactics alienated her friends.她操纵性的策略使她疏远了朋友。 eyeballsthe number of people viewing a particular website, television programme etc.眼球数观看特定网站、电视节目等的人数。The new campaign attracted millions of eyeballs.这项新活动吸引了数百万眼球。 biasesfeelings, often hidden or unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people偏见经常是隐藏的或无意识的，对某种想法或人群的偏好或偏见。Unconscious biases can significantly affect decision-making.无意识的偏见会严重影响决策。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】你能闻到家的味道吗？","path":"/2025/02/06/wechat-2025-02-06/","content":"【英文脚本】PhilHello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil? PhilYou know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room. BethVery nice! PhilWell, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home: Marnie ChestertonMy grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books. Tristan AhtoneI know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap. BethIn this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it.

PhilGood idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%? BethOh, I’m going to say b) 5%. PhilWell, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements: Tristan AhtoneOne thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there. BethTristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it. PhilThe truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements: Tristan AhtoneWell, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security. BethBy filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger. PhilEven though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home. BethRight, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question? PhilYes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think. BethIt is, yeah! PhilWell done! BethOK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell. PhilThe adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre. BethWhen someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen. PhilThe phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional. BethIf you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance. PhilAnd finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal.

What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?我是贝丝。Phil，是什么让家对你来说很特别？也许是睡在自己的床上，窗外的风景，或者是心爱的家庭宠物。是什么让你感觉像在家一样，Phil？ Phil(菲尔)You know what?

But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?好主意，贝丝！但现在是我提问的时候了。嗅觉非常强大，但并不是每个人都有。一小部分人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。那么，根据雷丁大学的研究，没有嗅觉的人占百分之几呢？是：a） 2%吗？b） 5%？或者，c） 7%？ Beth(贝丝)Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.哦，我要说 b） 5%。 Phil(菲尔)Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。你有没有放假回家，注意到家里有一股奇怪的气味？如果你有，别担心 —— 这还不错，事实上有科学原因，正如科学作家特里斯坦·阿通 （Tristan Ahtone） 对 BBC 国际服务节目《意想不到的元素》所解释的那样： Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.我一直在想的一件事是，每栋房子或每个家庭都有一股气味。当你从长途旅行回来时，你可能真的会在自己的家里注意到这一点，当你踏入前门时，东西闻起来有点奇怪。虽然您的房子很有可能因为已经关闭了几周而闻起来很奇怪，但您也有可能闻到家通常闻起来的味道，但当您在那里时，您只是没有注意到它。 Beth(贝丝)Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.特里斯坦说，当你离开后回到家时，你的房子很有可能闻起来很奇怪，这个形容词的意思是奇怪或不寻常。如果你说某事发生的可能性很大，你的意思是它发生的可能性很高。 Phil(菲尔)The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:事实是，每个家都有气味，尽管我们已经习惯了，但我们通常不会注意到。当我们吸气时，鼻子中的受体细胞会检测到空气中的分子，并将它们发送到大脑中的嗅觉器官。这些分析气味是否存在危险。你闻不到自己家的原因是它对你没有威胁。这是科学作家 Tristan Ahtone 再次向 BBC 国际服务节目 Unexpected Elements 解释更多内容： Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.好吧，通过过滤掉常见的非威胁性气味，可以更容易地检测到可能危险的异常事物。所以，例如，如果你忘记了吐司，它开始燃烧，你通常会很快闻到这种气味，因为这是你所处环境的变化。然后，您大脑的其他部分开始发挥作用，将烟味理解为潜在的伤害或威胁。但是，即使我们无法闻到自己家的气味，它们的气味仍然很重要，因为它与我们对舒适和安全的认识纠缠在一起。 Beth(贝丝)By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.通过过滤掉熟悉的气味，我们的大脑能够检测到其他不寻常、不寻常或不常见且可能很危险的气味。To filter something out 的意思是从其他事物中删除或分离不需要的事物。例如，过滤掉家的气味意味着我们会注意到烤面包燃烧的气味或其他气味，提醒我们可能的危险。 Phil(菲尔)Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.尽管我们通常不会注意到家中的气味 —— 特殊的气味 —— 但它仍然对大脑处理记忆和情感的边缘系统产生影响。这就解释了为什么气味对我们的感受有如此强烈的影响，以及为什么我们在家里感到舒适和安全。 Beth(贝丝)Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?对，Phil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Phil(菲尔)Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.是的，它是。我问你有多少百分比的人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。答案是 b） 5%，我想这就是你说的。 Beth(贝丝)It is, yeah!是的，是的！ Phil(菲尔)Well done!干的好！ Beth(贝丝)OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从嗅觉丧失开始，意思是没有嗅觉或嗅觉有限。 Phil(菲尔)The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.形容词 weird 的意思是奇怪、奇怪或奇异。 Beth(贝丝)When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.当有人说某事很有可能发生时，他们的意思是它很可能会发生。 Phil(菲尔)The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.短语 out of the ordinary 的意思是不寻常、不常见或例外。 Beth(贝丝)If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.如果你过滤掉一些东西，你就会从物质中去除或分离不需要的东西。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal.

I’m Pippa. NeilAnd I’m Neil. PippaNow, Neil, have you ever wanted to be a musician? NeilOh yes, Pippa, I still want to be a musician. I’ve been playing my guitar since I was 14. PippaWow. Well, maybe one day you’ll, you’ll manage it. Who knows? NeilWhat about you? PippaI don’t think I’d like to be a musician. I think it would be a bit stressful. Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful. NeilYeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too. PippaBut first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley NeilOh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles. PippaWell, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start? Bailey TomkinsonI grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11. NeilThis is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music. PippaBailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Bailey TomkinsonI would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up. NeilWhen she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music. PippaBailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people. NeilThe older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them. PippaLet’s meet another musician, Josh. Josh RobinsonSo, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that. PippaJosh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money. NeilBusking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities. Josh RobinsonIt’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking. PippaBusking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money. NeilHe says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word. PippaJosh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil? NeilOf course I would. PippaWell, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall NeilWow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more. PippaWell you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com. We’ll also put a link in the notes below this episode! NeilOK. So, what about your question, Pippa? PippaYes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts? The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis Presley? And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18. NeilReally? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well. PippaOK. NeilOK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music. PippaSongwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music. NeilA bunch of people is a group of people. PippaThe expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone. NeilBusking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money. PippaYour main earner is your main source of income. NeilGigs are musical concerts. PippaAnd the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.

Especially if you had lots of fans and were really successful.我认为我不想成为一名音乐家。我觉得这会有点压力。特别是如果你有很多粉丝并且真的很成功。 Neil(尼尔)Yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like? We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too.是的。我想知道音乐家的生活到底是什么样的？我们将在这个节目中发现这一点，因为我们听到英国各地一些想成为成功音乐家的人的声音，我们甚至还会听他们的一些音乐。 Pippa(皮帕)But first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Neil。在英国，我们有该国最畅销歌曲的每周排行榜。最畅销的歌曲被称为第一名。但是，您认为哪位音乐艺术家的英国排名第一的歌曲最多？a） 披头士乐队 b） 艾德·希兰 c） 猫王 Neil(尼尔)Oh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles.哦，好吧，我觉得这很容易。肯定是披头士乐队。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?好吧，我会在节目结束时透露答案。现在，获得第一名是许多音乐家的梦想。但是，如果你想成为一名音乐家，你从哪里开始呢？ Bailey Tomkinson(贝利·汤姆金森)I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.我在圣艾夫斯一个非常丰富的音乐环境中长大。我从大约 11 岁开始就开始打开麦克风。 Neil(尼尔)This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.这是贝利。她住在英格兰西南海岸康沃尔郡的圣艾夫斯。她说她从小就打算参加 Open Mic 之夜。Open Mic 之夜是任何人都可以唱歌或播放音乐的活动。 Pippa(皮帕)Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home.Bailey 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中谈到了她作为音乐家的生活。 Bailey Tomkinson(贝利·汤姆金森)I would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up.我会去 Kettle 的这些词曲作者圈子，眨眨眼，比如，周五放学后，我会成为最年轻的 50 岁的人。但我会和一群老人围坐在一个圈子里，他们会演奏 James Taylor、Carole King 和 The Eagles 以及很多 70 年代的音乐，我想这对我影响很大。但我想，你知道，每个人都把我放在他们的羽翼下。 Neil(尼尔)When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.年轻时，贝利去了词曲作者圈子。这些会议是为有兴趣创作自己的音乐的人准备的。 Pippa(皮帕)Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.Bailey 记得和一群老人坐在一起。A bunch 是谈论一群人的非正式方式。 Neil(尼尔)The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them.乐队中的老人们会演奏 1970 年代的音乐，贝利说他们把她放在自己的羽翼下。如果你把某人放在你的羽翼下，你就会决定保护他们或引导他们。 Pippa(皮帕)Let’s meet another musician, Josh.让我们来认识另一位音乐家 Josh。 Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)So, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.所以，我在大约 13 岁的时候学会了我的第一首正式的吉他歌曲。我真的在我能做到的那一刻就开始表演了。 Pippa(皮帕)Josh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.Josh 住在伦敦，是一名街头艺人。这意味着他在街上或公共场所表演以赚钱。 Neil(尼尔)Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities.街头表演是音乐家赚钱和向更多人表演的常见方式。正如 Josh 在 BBC 学习英语节目 My Song， My Home 中所说的那样，它可以帮助音乐家获得新的机会。 Josh Robinson(乔什·罗宾逊)It’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities. It’s got me all my gigs, it’s got me all my connections. So I owe a lot to busking.这有点像我的主要收入来源，让我在过去十年左右的时间里一直坚持下去。从那时起，它为我带来了各种不同的机会。它有我所有的演出，它有我所有的人脉。所以我欠街头表演很多。 Pippa(皮帕)Busking is Josh’s main earner, it’s his main source of money.街头表演是 Josh 的主要收入来源，也是他的主要资金来源。 Neil(尼尔)He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections. Gigs are musical concerts. It’s an informal, slang word.他说，街头表演让他获得了所有的演出和人脉。演出是音乐会。这是一个非正式的俚语。 Pippa(皮帕)Josh says he owes a lot to busking. If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that person or thing. So, would you like to listen to some of Josh’s music, Neil?Josh 说他欠街头表演很多。如果你欠某人或某事很多，那么你会因为那个人或事而获得成功或幸福。那么，你想听一些 Josh 的音乐吗，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)Of course I would.我当然会。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, here’s a bit of his song That Side of the Wall, which he performed for BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Clip from song Can you leave me something Can you leave it by the door So I know there’s something Or someone That side of the wall Stop the heat from coming ‘Cause I always liked the cold I need some belonging Or someone That side of the wall嗯，这是他的歌曲《那边的墙》（That Side of the Wall），他为 BBC 学习英语节目《我的歌，我的家》（My Song， My Home） 演唱了这首歌。歌曲剪辑 你能给我留下点东西吗 你能把它留在门口吗 所以我知道有什么东西或某人 那边的墙 阻止热量来临 因为我总是喜欢寒冷 我需要一些归属感 或者某人 那边的墙 Neil(尼尔)Wow. Josh is pretty good, isn’t he? I’d love to hear more.哇。乔什还不错，不是吗？我很想听听更多。 Pippa(皮帕)Well you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

And you said The Beatles, Neil. But the answer is actually Elvis Presley. He’s had 21 number one songs and The Beatles have had 18.是的，我问哪位艺术家在英国排行榜上排名第一的歌曲最多？披头士乐队、艾德·希兰 （Ed Sheeran） 还是猫王 （Elvis Presley）？你说的是披头士乐队，尼尔。但答案实际上是猫王。他有 21 首排名第一的歌曲，披头士乐队有 18 首。 Neil(尼尔)Really? Well that’s OK, I love ‘the King’ as well.真？好吧，没关系，我也喜欢《国王》。 Pippa(皮帕)OK.还行。 Neil(尼尔)OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this musical episode, starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.好，让我们回顾一下我们在这一集音乐剧中学到的词汇，从开放麦克风之夜开始，任何人都可以唱歌或播放音乐的活动。 Pippa(皮帕)Songwriters’ circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.词曲作者圈子是有兴趣创作自己的音乐的人的聚会。 Neil(尼尔)A bunch of people is a group of people.一群人就是一群人。 Pippa(皮帕)The expression take someone under your wing means to protect or guide someone.这句话 take someone under your wing 的意思是保护或引导某人。 Neil(尼尔)Busking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.街头艺人是在公共场所表演赚钱，街头艺人是在街上表演赚钱的人。 Pippa(皮帕)Your main earner is your main source of income.您的主要收入来源是您的主要收入来源。 Neil(尼尔)Gigs are musical concerts.演出是音乐会。 Pippa(皮帕)And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that person or thing.而 to dowe a lot to someone or something 这句话，意思是因为那个人或事物而获得成功或幸福。 Neil(尼尔)Once again our six minutes are up, but you can find My Song, My Home on our website – bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilLove it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth? BethErm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really. PhilWell, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful. BethIn this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases. PhilBut first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million? BethI’m going to go for b) 42,000. PhilOK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started: Adam ChandlerAt the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way. BethThe rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story. PhilIn the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results. BethWhich is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination. PhilThe success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal. BethBut not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik. Andie Sophia FontaineThere’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009. PhilIceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger. BethMcDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil. PhilYes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something. BethIf you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges. PhilThe American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard. BethThe adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time. PhilA take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it. BethAnd finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon! PhilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)I’m Phil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?不管你喜欢还是讨厌，毫无疑问，快餐很受欢迎。贝丝，你是快餐迷吗？ Beth(贝丝)Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.呃，不是真的，不是。我认为有时它可能非常方便，显然是因为它很快，但并非真的。 Phil(菲尔)Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.好吧，无论你怎么看它们，像肯德基、达美乐，当然还有大麦当劳这样的快餐品牌，都取得了令人难以置信的成功。 Beth(贝丝)In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.在本节目中，我们将讨论快餐从 1950 年代美国开始的全球传播。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。 Phil(菲尔)But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?但首先，我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。英国大约有多少家快餐店？是：a） 4,000 个？b） 42,000 人？或者，c） 四百万？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to go for b) 42,000.我要选 b） 42,000。 Phil(菲尔)OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:好的，稍后我们会找出答案。在美国，自 1950 年代以来，汉堡包、炸薯条和奶昔等廉价易行的食物一直很受欢迎。请听亚当·钱德勒 （Adam Chandler） 讲述 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》（The Food Chain） 的故事，该书追溯了美国快餐的历史，该书的作者 Drive-Thru Dreams 讲述了这一切是如何开始的： Adam Chandler(亚当·钱德勒)At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.快餐故事的核心是一种非常 “任何人都可以做到 ”的感觉。许多公司创始人没有大学学位，在很多情况下没有高中学历，不是靠金钱赚钱的，他们通常只是准备将自己插入一个适合他们的系统的人。它确实做到了。在那个时代，机会变得非常、非常容易，因为这是美国经验的新部分。所以，在很小的方面，美国梦在很大程度上变成了美国梦。 Beth(贝丝)The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.快餐的兴起反映了二战后美国经济实力的崛起。当 Adam 说这是故事的核心时，他的意思是这是故事中最重要的部分。 Phil(菲尔)In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.在 1950 年代，当我们今天所知道的著名品牌刚刚起步时，任何具有积极进取的态度的人都可以销售快餐。“我能行”的态度描述了一个有信心并决心解决问题并取得成果的人。 Beth(贝丝)Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.这正是 Kentucky Fried Chicken 和 McDonald’s 等成功餐厅发生的事情。对许多人来说，这些快餐品牌象征着美国梦 —— 即在美国，任何人都可以通过努力工作和决心取得成功。 Phil(菲尔)The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.肯德基、麦当劳和其他公司的成功不仅限于美国。如今，您可以参观地球两侧的两家麦当劳，并吃完全相同的饭菜。 Beth(贝丝)But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.但并不是每个国家都张开怀抱欢迎 —— 冰岛这个小岛就是其中之一。安迪·索菲亚·方丹 （Andie Sophia Fontaine） 曾经在麦当劳工作，现在是《冰岛评论》的编辑。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain，当麦当劳开始在冰岛首都雷克雅未克销售汉堡时，它受到了冷遇。 Andie Sophia Fontaine(安迪·索菲亚·方丹)There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.冰岛的汉堡文化由来已久。他们对汉堡包有自己的想法，他们将使用生菜、生黄瓜和一种炸酱 —— 称为 shalpuborgari，或商店汉堡，已经存在了很长时间。是的，所以麦当劳 —— 他们努力维持市场。棺材上的最后一枚钉子是 2008&#x2F;2009 年的全球金融危机。 Phil(菲尔)Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.冰岛已经有吃汉堡的悠久传统 —— 这一传统已经存在了很长时间。例如，shalpuborgari 或商店汉堡是美国汉堡包的变体。 Beth(贝丝)McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.麦当劳在冰岛并不像其他地方那样成功。而 2008 年的全球金融危机是棺材上的最后一枚钉子，这一事件导致了已经开始出错的事情的失败。直到今天，冰岛还没有麦当劳，不像英国，这让我想起了你的问题，菲尔。 Phil(菲尔)Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.是的。我问你英国有多少家快餐店。我问你是 4,000 人、42,000 人还是 400 万人。当然，答案是 42,000 个，所以你是对的，干得好！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从核心开始，意思是某事最重要的部分或原因。 Beth(贝丝)If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.如果你说某人有“我能行”的态度，你的意思是他们有信心采取行动、解决问题和应对新的挑战。 Phil(菲尔)The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.美国梦是相信如果努力工作，美国每个人都有机会获得成功和快乐。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.这个形容词 long-based 的意思是已经存在了很长时间。 Phil(菲尔)A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.对某物的接受意味着一种变体，或一种新的呈现方式。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilSo, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best? BethI think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world. PhilWell, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings. BethThe rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’. Sean CoughlanWhen they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’. PhilSean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries. BethPhil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK? PhilI think it might be b) Ireland. BethOK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings. Sean CoughlanThey’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it. PhilWe heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace. BethWe use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically. PhilWe also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering. BethSo, what makes countries perform better in these tests?

Goodbye for now! BethBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)I’m Phil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?所以，贝丝，我们谈论的是当今世界上最好的教育系统。你在英国上学。您如何看待英国的教育体系？你认为这可能是最好的吗？ Beth(贝丝)I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.我认为它相当不错，我个人可能会改变它的一些事情，但我想说它相当不错，但可能不是世界上最好的。 Phil(菲尔)Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论 Pisa 排名。 Beth(贝丝)The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.该排名基于经合组织（OECD）每三年进行的一次测试。这些测试试图显示哪些国家在数学、科学和阅读教学方面最有效。但这真的可以衡量吗？嗯，这是前 BBC 教育记者肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 与 BBC 世界服务节目“全球故事”的对话。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.当它们第一次被引入时，这是一个非常有争议的想法，因为人们说’你怎么可能比较大国……你怎么能把美国与卢森堡或中国的部分地区，或者其他什么地方进行比较呢？ Phil(菲尔)Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.肖恩说，这些测试是有争议的。如果某件事是有争议的，那么它就是人们可能会争论的事情 —— 它是有争议的。因此，起初，比萨测试是有争议的，因为不是每个人都认为比较非常不同的国家是公平的。 Beth(贝丝)Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?Phil，我有一个关于他们的问题要问你。因此，在 2022 年，新加坡在阅读排名中名列前茅。但这些国家中哪些位居第二呢？是：a） 美国？b） 爱尔兰？或者，c） 英国？ Phil(菲尔)I think it might be b) Ireland.我想可能是 b） 爱尔兰。 Beth(贝丝)OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.还行。好吧，我们将在节目结束时发现这是否正确。比萨排名的一个常见模式是，最成功的国家往往规模较小。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 在接受 BBC 国际频道节目“全球故事”采访时告诉我们，许多西欧大国在排名中的得分并不高。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.他们被这些快速崛起的国家超越和超越 —— 你知道的，新加坡、爱沙尼亚、台湾，或者那些我们历史上不认为是经济竞争对手的地方，但我想 PISA 测试的论点是，如果你想拥有一种知识经济，一种基于技能的经济，这就是你衡量它的方式。 Phil(菲尔)We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.我们听说许多欧洲大国正在被小国超越。如果有人超过你，他们就会比你走得更快 —— 速度更高。 Beth(贝丝)We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.我们使用前缀 ‘out-‘ 来表示某人或某事更擅长做某事。我们还听说，小国“跑赢”大国 —— 它们的表现更好。新加坡、爱沙尼亚和台湾被描述为欧洲大国的经济竞争对手 —— 这意味着它们在经济上正在与这些国家竞争。 Phil(菲尔)We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.我们还听说了知识经济。这是一个以服务行业为基础的经济，这些行业要求工人受过高等教育，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。 Beth(贝丝)So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.那么，是什么让各国在这些测试中表现得更好呢？让我们再次聆听 BBC 国际服务节目“全球故事”。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 告诉我们，那些优先考虑让每个人都达到一定水平的国家做得很好。我们还听取了爱沙尼亚学校校长 Rando Kuustik 的发言。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.确保所有学生都能接受一定水平的教育达到一定标准的国家，无论他们的背景如何，都做得很好。 Rando Kuustik(兰多·库斯蒂克)If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.如果你用不同的水平或能力来教他们，那么你就是在隔离他们，我们不想把世界上的任何人都隔离开来，为什么我们在学校里这样做呢？这是爱沙尼亚成功的主要原因之一。 Phil(菲尔)Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.Sean 说，最成功的系统将每个人都教育到特定的标准，无论他们的背景如何。如果一件事发生而不考虑其他事情，这意味着其他事情不重要，或者不是问题。 Beth(贝丝)Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.兰多·库斯蒂克 （Rando Kuustik） 说，爱沙尼亚的学校不想隔离学生。隔离的意思是分离和保持分离。 Phil(菲尔)So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?那么，我们刚刚听说了爱沙尼亚，但贝丝，您的问题呢？那些国家呢？ Beth(贝丝)I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.我问你，在 2022 年 Pisa 排名中，美国、爱尔兰和英国的阅读量排名第二。你说的是爱尔兰，这是正确的答案。干的好！好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的关于教育排名的词汇，从有争议的 - 争论的或有争议的开始。 Phil(菲尔)If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.如果你被某人超越，他们就会比你走得更快。 Beth(贝丝)Rivals are competitors.竞争对手就是竞争对手。 Phil(菲尔)A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.知识经济是一种基于需要受过高等教育的工人的行业，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。 Beth(贝丝)If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.如果某件事发生，而不考虑第二件事，那么第二件事对它的发生没有影响。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilMost people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth? BethOh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you? PhilI ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious! BethOh, OK. Good! PhilWell, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com. BethBut let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself: David ShirleyI had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years. PhilDavid tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently. BethA 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables? PhilOh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer. BethOK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old: Fuchsia DunlopIn China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer. PhilCooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years. BethWow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling. PhilProfessor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages: Prof Martha CarlinIn theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time. BethHaving hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made. PhilStarting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question? BethAh, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time. PhilWhen food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently. BethThe verb replenish means to fill something up again. PhilIf something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true. BethWhen you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made. PhilAnd finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. Once again, our six minutes are up.

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain： David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。 Phil(菲尔)David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。 Beth(贝丝)A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？ Phil(菲尔)Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。 Beth(贝丝)OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜： Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。 Phil(菲尔)Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。 Beth(贝丝)Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。 Phil(菲尔)Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物： Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。 Beth(贝丝)Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。 Phil(菲尔)Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？ Beth(贝丝)Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。 Phil(菲尔)When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。 Beth(贝丝)The verb replenish means to fill something up again.动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。 Phil(菲尔)If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。 Beth(贝丝)When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil? PhilOh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre? BethOK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day? PhilI think it’s probably about two litres. BethAh, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well. PhilAnd speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. BethGreat! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water? PhilI think it’s around 80% water. BethOK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman: Professor John SpeakmanSo, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water. PhilProfessor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it. BethYes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’. PhilWhat Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct. BethActually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size. PhilBut what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain. Dr Nidia Rodriguez-SanchezAnd also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration. PhilDr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition. BethSo, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations. PhilIf an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it. BethThe phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate. PhilA ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.

BethBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)I’m Phil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Phil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil?我是 Beth。如今，我经常看到人们随身携带水瓶以确保他们喝得足够。你每天喝多少水，Phil？ Phil(菲尔)Oh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre?哦，我不知道。也许大约一升？ Beth(贝丝)OK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？ Phil(菲尔)I think it’s probably about two litres.我想大概是两升。 Beth(贝丝)Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well.啊，嗯，很多人听说的数字是每天两升。当然，每个人都需要喝一些水 —— 人体的一半以上是由水组成的。但是，我们究竟需要多少水才能保持健康呢？这就是我们将在本节目中讨论的内容，以及一些有用的新词汇。 Phil(菲尔)And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.说到词汇，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上下载该节目中的所有新单词和短语，以及帮助您学习它们的工作表练习，bbclearningenglish.com。 Beth(贝丝)Great! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？ Phil(菲尔)I think it’s around 80% water.我认为大约 80% 是水。 Beth(贝丝)OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授： Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。 Phil(菲尔)Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。 Beth(贝丝)Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。 Phil(菲尔)What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。 Beth(贝丝)Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。 Phil(菲尔)But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。 Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。 Phil(菲尔)Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。 Beth(贝丝)So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。 Phil(菲尔)If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。 Beth(贝丝)The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。 Phil(菲尔)A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。 Beth(贝丝)Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up. Why not join me now and head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, download the worksheet for this programme, and test yourself to see how much you remember?

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. NeilLots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear. BethHave you had any embarrassing moments, Neil? NeilYes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple. BethOh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend. NeilWhat was the voice? BethHello? NeilOh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about. BethYes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences. NeilIn this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases. BethSo, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ? NeilSo I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%. BethOK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if thedifference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health: Dr Vanessa ApeaSo they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really. NeilMany people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination. BethFor some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends. NeilThere are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health: James GallagherCan you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease? Dr Vanessa ApeaI bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues. BethJames asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone. NeilAs well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question? BethIt is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil? NeilYes, I think I said c) 61%. BethI’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time. NeilTo diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient. BethIf you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help. NeilThe phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed. BethThe adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else. NeilAnd finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings.

BethBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是 Beth。 Neil(尼尔)Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.很多事情都会让我们感到尴尬 —— 当你的脸涨红，你希望自己能消失时，那种自我意识、不舒服的感觉。 Beth(贝丝)Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.是的，很多。有一次我在停车场遇到了我的父母，我看到他们开着他们的车来了，我以一种非常愚蠢的方式挥了挥手。但不幸的是，我很快发现那不是我的父母。那是另一对。 Beth(贝丝)Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.哦，不，这真的很尴尬。我记得接电话时，我以为是我最好的朋友，我用非常愚蠢的声音说了一声“你好”，然后他们要求和我爸爸说话，但那不是我的朋友。 Neil(尼尔)What was the voice?声音是什么？ Beth(贝丝)Hello?你好？ Neil(尼尔)Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.哦，天哪。但尴尬不仅仅是害羞和脸红。当谈到我们的健康时，有无穷无尽的事情值得尴尬。 Beth(贝丝)Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。 Neil(尼尔)In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。 Beth(贝丝)So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？ Neil(尼尔)So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。 Beth(贝丝)OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。 As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释： Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。 Neil(尼尔)Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。 Beth(贝丝)For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。 Neil(尼尔)There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:医生也可以通过多种方式提供帮助，正如 Vanessa Apea 博士在这里向 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 解释的那样： James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?您能告诉我们您用了什么技巧来让人们放心吗？ Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查……我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间……所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。 Beth(贝丝)James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.詹姆斯问医生可以做些什么来让人们放松 —— 让他们感到平静和放松 —— Apea 医生描述了她理想的对话：这是一个安全的空间，不带评判，所说的是保密的，保密的，不与任何人分享。 Neil(尼尔)As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Beth(贝丝)It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?是的。我问你：有多少百分比的人说他们因为尴尬而推迟去看医生，但后来被诊断出患有健康状况？你还记得你说过的话吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I think I said c) 61%.是的，我想我说的是 c） 61%。 Beth(贝丝)I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.恐怕这不是正确的答案。事实上，它是 a） 21% 或略高于五分之一。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的新词汇，从 delay 开始，推迟或推迟到以后。 Neil(尼尔)To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.To diagnose a disease or medical condition 的意思是通过识别症状和检查患者来识别它。 Beth(贝丝)If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.如果你默默忍受，你会忍受痛苦的感觉，并在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦的感受作斗争。 Neil(尼尔)The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.短语动词 put someone at ease 的意思是让某人感到平静和放松。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.形容词 confidential 的意思是保密和秘密，并描述不与其他任何人共享的信息。 Neil(尼尔)And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob. DanAnd I’m Dan. RobNow, do you know who Michelle Obama is? DanEr, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America. RobThat is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan? Dan th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century. RobOK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before? BBC News ReportThe former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady. Rob So, where did she revisit on this trip? DanShe went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved. RobThe report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing. DanOne of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position. RobThere is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do. DanI get that feeling all the time! RobI wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us. DanWell, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves. RobLet’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities. Michelle ObamaThat’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in. RobShe says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’. DanShe uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with. Rob Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said? DanI thought it was the 20th Century. RobWell, you were right. DanYay! Robth But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary. DanWe started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject. RobThen there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities. Dan The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired. RobNext there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’. DanThe next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from. RobAnd finally there was the noun phrase station in life. DanYour station in life is your position in society – your social status. RobAnd that brings us to the end of this week’s programme. We’ll be back soon and in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our app and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye bye for now.

Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.呃，是的。也许是世界上最著名的女性？前第一夫人，这意味着她是美利坚合众国总统的妻子。 Rob(罗伯)That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?这是正确的。她刚刚出版了自己的自传，并一直在英国谈论她的生活。在我们了解更多信息之前，以下是本周的问题。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪还是，c） 20 世纪，有什么想法吗？ Dan (担 )th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.th 这可能是一个棘手的问题。第一任美国总统是在 18 世纪，他们有妻子，但我认为实际的术语可能只是在很久以后才引入的 —— 所以我要大胆猜测一下，说 20 世纪。 Rob(罗伯)OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?还行。好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 对英国的访问进行了 BBC 新闻报道。根据这份报告，她去过哪里，而她以前去过哪里？ BBC News Report(BBC新闻报道)The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.这位前第一夫人公开谈论了许多问题，她的主要信息之一是关于赋权。当天早些时候，奥巴马夫人再次访问了伦敦北部的一所学校，她说，她在担任第一夫人期间第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。 Rob (罗伯 )So, where did she revisit on this trip?那么，她这次旅行重访了哪里呢？ Dan(担)She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.她在伦敦北部的一所学校上学。她说，正是在这所学校，她第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。如果你受到启发去做某事，你会有一种强烈的感觉，你想做某事，你会有一种强烈的动力去实现某件事，通常是因为别人说过或取得了成就。 Rob(罗伯)The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.该报告还提到，她公开谈论了一些问题。公开谈论某事是指您讨论一个话题，通常是一个困难的话题，而不试图隐藏事实或您的感受。当人们谈论生活中他们觉得困难或尴尬的事情时，会用到这个短语。 Dan(担)One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.她公开谈论的一件事是她自己觉得自己并不真正属于这里，她真的有技能或才能来做她正在做的事情，她不配得到这个职位。 Rob(罗伯)There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.它有一个名字。这被称为冒名顶替者综合症 —— 那种感觉，你认为有一天每个人都会意识到你真的不太擅长你所做的事情。 Dan(担)I get that feeling all the time!我一直都有这种感觉！ Rob(罗伯)I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.我想知道为什么？因为这种冒名顶替者综合症的问题在于它没有道理。这更多的是缺乏自信或社会给我们贴标签的结果。 Dan(担)Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.好吧，无论如何，回到报告。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 也热衷于谈论赋权的话题。这给了人们力量、信心和力量，让他们靠自己实现他们想要的生活。 Rob(罗伯)Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.现在让我们听听米歇尔·奥巴马本人如何谈论我们有时如何根据他们的阶级而不是他们的个人能力来评判他们。 Michelle Obama(米歇尔·奥巴马)That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.这通常是我们犯的错误，我们假设工人阶级本身并不具有很高的天赋，而很多时候你的生活地位受到你所处环境的限制。 Rob(罗伯)She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.她在这里说，我们根据人们的社会地位或生活中的地位来假设他们的事情。假设的意思是“做出的判断不是基于事实，而是基于我们认为是真实的”。 Dan(担)She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.她自己使用了这个短语。当你说某人本身就有才华时，这意味着他们的才华来自他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们碰巧与之相关的任何组织、个人或阶级有任何联系。 Rob (罗伯 )Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪，还是 c） 20 世纪，还有丹，你说？ Dan(担)I thought it was the 20th Century.我以为是 20 世纪。 Rob(罗伯)Well, you were right.嗯，你是对的。 Dan(担)Yay!耶！ Rob(罗伯)th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.但让我说完。你是对的，那时晚于 18 世纪，而 18 世纪是第一任美国总统任职的时候，但还没有到 20 世纪。19 世纪下半叶，第一夫人的头衔开始使用。现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Dan(担)We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.我们从 to open ly talk about something 这句话开始。这意味着讨论某事，通常是一个困难的话题，而不隐藏您对该主题的感受、情绪或事实。 Rob(罗伯)Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.然后是名词 empowerment。这是给人一种他们掌控自己生活的感觉的过程，使人们对自己的权利和能力更有信心。 Dan (担 )The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.接下来是动词 inspire。如果你激励人们，你就会给他们一种感觉，他们想做一些事情，并且可以做一些困难的事情或有创意的事情。如果你自己也有这种感觉，你就会受到启发。 Rob(罗伯)Next there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.接下来是动词 to assume something。To assume 的意思是“不是根据证据，而是根据你认为或相信是真实的事物来判断某人或某事”。 Dan(担)The next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from.下一句话本身就是他们自己的。例如，如果某人本身就成功了，这意味着他们的成功是因为他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们为谁工作、与谁一起工作或他们来自哪个社会群体。 Rob(罗伯)And finally there was the noun phrase station in life.最后是名词短语 station in life。 Dan(担)Your station in life is your position in society – your social status.你的人生地位就是你在社会中的地位 —— 你的社会地位。 Rob(罗伯)And that brings us to the end of this week’s programme. We’ll be back soon and in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our app and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob. NeilAnd I’m Neil. RobToday we’re talking about buttons. NeilYes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen. RobThings like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil? Neil Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one. RobWell, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons? Professor Steven ConnorWe do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something. Rob OK. What does he say about children and buttons? NeilThat they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach. RobYes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us. NeilBut many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient. RobProfessor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion? Professor Steven ConnorYou know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes. RobSo then, why can’t we resist buttons? NeilBecause as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures. RobThe use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it? NeilNo, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them. RobAnd one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again. Professor Steven ConnorYou know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes. Rob Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said? NeilI didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia. RobThat it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary. NeilWe’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen. RobButtons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t. Neil And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily. RobProfessor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands. NeilThe professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe. RobAnd finally we had grooming. NeilThis is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other. RobWell the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now. Neil Bye! Can I just press that button? RobOh go on then, if you like! 【中英文双语脚本】Rob(罗伯)Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil.我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)Today we’re talking about buttons.今天我们讨论的是按钮。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen.是的，按钮。纽扣是我们衣服上用来固定它们的东西，但这个词也用于我们推动以使事情发生的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil?比如你的床头闹钟、收音机、烤面包机、水壶。我们每周都会不假思索地按下数百个按钮。不过，并不是每个人都喜欢纽扣，尤其是我们衣服上的纽扣。这是一种公认的恐惧症。这种恐惧叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，有什么想法吗，尼尔？ Neil (尼尔 )Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one.呃 – 我想我害怕发音这些词！不知道答案是什么，我认为纽扣恐惧症太明显了 —— 所以它是其他问题之一 —— 或者是吗？这是一个艰难的问题。 Rob(罗伯)Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。Thinking Allowed 是 BBC Radio 4 的一档节目，涵盖了一系列有趣的话题。最近，他们讨论了纽扣以及它们对日常生活的重要性。剑桥大学英语教授 Steven Connor 参加了该节目，他谈到了纽扣的吸引力。关于子项和按钮，怎么说？ Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.我们确实喜欢纽扣，我认为纽扣的乐趣和诱惑……这种诱惑，每个人都能感受到，这就是为什么按钮必须非常方便。另一方面，它们必须远离儿童，所以它们必须放在墙上的高处，真正重要的按钮必须非常难以按下 —— 比如放在玻璃后面或其他东西。 Rob (罗伯 )OK. What does he say about children and buttons?还行。他对孩子和纽扣有什么看法？ Neil(尼尔)That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.他们必须远离他们！正如我之前所说，我小时候就喜欢按下按钮。我会按我看到的任何东西，所以重要的肯定是我够不着的。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.是的，他说纽扣是一种诱惑。诱惑是让你想做某事的东西，它经常被用来做你真的不应该做的事情。因此，导致潜在危险或严重后果的按钮（如火灾警报器）需要受到保护，也许是在玻璃后面，这样诱惑就不会战胜我们。 Neil(尼尔)But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.但是许多按钮在日常生活中都有有用的实用用途，例如呼叫电梯 - 因此这些按钮必须易于使用且没有困难。这个形容词很方便。这些日常按钮必须方便。 Rob(罗伯)Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?Connor 教授继续详细介绍了纽扣为何如此吸引人。他怎么看？ Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。 Rob(罗伯)So then, why can’t we resist buttons?那么，为什么我们不能抗拒纽扣呢？ Neil(尼尔)Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.因为作为人类，我们有一种坐立不安的本能。我们不能长时间静止不动，我们需要经常四处走动，因为我们是非常数字化的生物。 Rob(罗伯)The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?不过，数字的使用与现代在线技术无关，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.不，手指是手指或脚趾。所以我们是数字生物 – 我们有手指，我们喜欢使用它们。 Rob(罗伯)And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.其他数字生物（如猿类）所做的一件事是梳理毛发。也就是说，他们用手清洁其他猿类的体毛。他们通过毛发寻找昆虫和虫子，然后把它们拉出来吃掉。但我们也可以用 grooming 这个词来形容人类，例如，一个整洁、干净、得体的人。又是康纳教授。 Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。 Rob (罗伯 )Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。有些人害怕纽扣，这是一种公认的恐惧症，但它叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，还有 Neil，你说的？ Neil(尼尔)I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.我没有，但我不认为这可能是 “纽扣恐惧症”，那太容易了。我认为 coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧，所以我选择了另一个 - koumpounophobia。 Rob(罗伯)That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.没错。Buttonophobia 是一个虚构的词，正如你所说，coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧。好，现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Neil(尼尔)We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.我们一直在谈论按钮。这些可以是我们用来固定衣服的小圆件，也可以是我们推动某事发生的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.按钮可能是一种诱惑。我们看到一个，我们想推动它。所以诱惑是让我们想要做一些我们知道不应该做的事情。 Neil (尼尔 )And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.然后我们有了形容词 方便。方便的东西很容易使用。例如，呼叫电梯的按钮位于非常方便的高度，可以很容易地触及。 Rob(罗伯)Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.康纳教授接着谈到了我们坐立不安的本能。作为人类，我们喜欢坐立不安，我们喜欢四处走动，我们不能长时间保持静止，我们喜欢用手做事。 Neil(尼尔)The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.教授谈到我们是数字生物，这意味着有手指的生物 —— 数字是手指或脚趾的另一种说法。 Rob(罗伯)And finally we had grooming.最后我们进行了梳理。 Neil(尼尔)This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.这是通过清洁、洗头和做头发来让自己看起来漂亮的习惯。这是一些动物（例如猿类）为彼此做的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today.

This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilWhat do you remember of your teenage years? RobOh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil? NeilWell, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly. RobSo whose fault is it? NeilOur brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob? Rob Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess. NeilI’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out? Professor Sarah-Jayne BlakemoreThe first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false. Neil So when did the research into the teenage brain come out? RobSurprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published. NeilAnd she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she? RobNo, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years. NeilWhat I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop. RobYes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true. NeilSo our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time? Professor Sarah-Jayne BlakemoreThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet. NeilSo the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob? RobA cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence. NeilSo this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework! RobHa, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”. NeilYes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said? RobI guessed c) 1950s NeilThe answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary. RobAdolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period. NeilSo an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence. Rob Exactly. NeilPapers is the word for published scientific research. RobDogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged. NeilThe prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks. RobAnd cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions. NeilWell my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish. RobWell, your skills are working well Neil. We may be going now but you don’t need to – you can listen or watch us again and find lots more learning English materials on our social media platforms. You can also visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com. NeilSee you soon, goodbye. Rob Bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)What do you remember of your teenage years?你还记得你的青少年时代吗？ Rob(罗伯)Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?哦，我简直是一场噩梦。我对父母很粗鲁，总是在外面呆到很晚，从不做作业，和错误的人一起出去玩，做了很多错误的决定。你呢，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.嗯，真的差不多。人们总是这样说青少年，不是吗？他们经历了一段失控和行为不端的时期。但显然，这不是他们的错。至少不是直接的。 Rob(罗伯)So whose fault is it?那么是谁的错呢？ Neil(尼尔)Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?显然是我们的大脑。青少年的大脑仍在控制行为的区域发育，这可能意味着你不能责怪他们的行为方式。在我们了解更多信息之前，让我们先提出我们的问题。一直都有青少年，但“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的呢？是： a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 有什么想法吗，罗伯？ Rob (罗伯 )Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.嗯，我认为它大约出现在摇滚乐时代，所以那应该是 1950 年代。这是我的猜测。 Neil(尼尔)I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。来自伦敦大学学院的 Sarah-Jayne Blakemore 专门研究大脑的运作，尤其是青少年的大脑。最近，她是 BBC 广播节目 The Life Scientific 的嘉宾。她解释说，关于大脑在青少年时期仍在发育的理解是相当新的。她说第一项研究是什么时候出来的？ Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.第一项研究表明，人脑在整个青春期和 20 多岁都经历了这种非常实质性和显着的发展；第一批论文发表于 90 年代后期。在此之前，例如当我上大学时，教科书中的教条是，绝大多数大脑发育发生在生命的最初几年，童年中期之后就没有什么太大的变化了。这个教条是完全错误的。 Neil (尼尔 )So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?那么，对青少年大脑的研究是什么时候出来的呢？ Rob(罗伯)Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.令人惊讶的是，直到 1990 年代后期才出现。就在这时，她说关于这个主题的第一批论文发表了。在这种情况下，论文是指已发表的科学研究成果。 Neil(尼尔)And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?她实际上并没有谈论青少年，对吧？ Rob(罗伯)No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.不，没错。她谈到了青春期。这个名词，青春期，是一个人从儿童发展成成人的时期，它或多或少与青少年时期相同。 Neil(尼尔)What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.我发现有趣的是，在 1990 年代之前，人们认为我们的大脑发育方式有所不同。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.是的，布莱克莫尔教授说，当时的教条是，我们的大脑大多在儿童早期就已经完全发育，早在青春期之前。教条是一个词，用于描述人们被期望接受为真理的强烈信念。 Neil(尼尔)So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?因此，我们的大脑发育仍然比最初认为的要晚得多。这告诉我们关于青少年行为的什么信息？特别令人感兴趣的是大脑的一个重要部分，称为前额叶皮层。布莱克莫尔教授又来了。她能给那些没有按时完成作业的青少年找什么借口呢？ Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.前额叶皮层是大脑中位于前额正后方的部分，它参与了一系列非常高级的认知任务，例如决策和规划 —— 我们知道这个区域在青少年时期正在经历非常非常大量的发育。因此，就我们对青少年的期望而言，例如，计划他们的家庭作业，考虑到我们知道大脑中关键参与计划的区域还没有发育，这可能太高了。 Neil(尼尔)So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?所以前额叶皮层在认知任务中很重要。那些是什么，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.认知任务是需要有意识地思考和处理的任务，例如做出决策和规划。它不会自动发生，您必须考虑它。所以在青少年时期，大脑的这一部分还没有完全发育。请注意我们早期青春期的名词的形容词形式。 Neil(尼尔)So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!所以这给了你不做功课的好借口！ Rob(罗伯)Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.哈，哈，我真希望我早就知道了。我曾经说我把作业忘在了公共汽车上，或者狗吃了它。现在我可以说，’对不起，先生，我的大脑还不够发达，无法完成计划家庭作业的认知任务’。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?是的，我确定那会奏效！在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。我问“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的人？你说是：a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)I guessed c) 1950s我猜 c） 1950 年代 Neil(尼尔)The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilWe’re going to be looking at a letter from the English alphabet. It’s a letter which has a particular meaning when used at the end of a piece of informal writing such as letters, emails, texts and messages. RobI’m very EXcited. NeilHa ha, very good, very good Rob! RobMy EXpectations are really high. NeilYep, that’s another good one. RobIs it an EXtraordinary letter? NeilOK, thank you Rob, that’s enough of your jokes. I’m getting EXasperated! Oh, now you’ve got me at it! Well, no prizes for guessing what letter we’re focussing on today? Rob Why? NeilNo, it’s not Y. Rob No, no. I didn’t mean the letter ‘y’, I meant the word ‘why’, as in - why are there no prizes? NeilBecause of all the not so subtle clues you’ve been giving. The letter is X. RobYes. Exactly. NeilAlright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let’s have a question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? Any ideas Rob? Rob An excellent question but quite obscure, I’m going to say b) Hindi. NeilWell, I’ll have the answer later on. Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean? RobWell, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing. NeilWhere does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from? Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans… Presenter:That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there. Presenter:It has, clunk. Neil What do we learn about the origins of the X for kisses? RobWell, it’s been used since at least 1763 and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks. NeilAnd why did this come to mean a kiss? RobWell, Dr Wright suggests it’s because of the original pronunciation - &#x2F;ks&#x2F;. NeilAnd at the point the presenter made the connection, didn’t he? RobYes, he did. And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped. NeilAnd this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk. RobAlthough, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example. NeilLet’s listen to that exchange again. Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans… Presenter:That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there. Presenter:It has, clunk. NeilOne thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something you do for everyone. It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake? Professor Nils Langer, University of BristolA colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs. Presenter:They docked her another 20 quid, I think! NeilWhat was her mistake, Rob? RobShe didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax. NeilWe don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been. RobYes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound. Neil Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? RobI guessed b) Hindi. NeilWell, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme. RobWe started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling. NeilThe phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something Rob A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other. NeilThe Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority. RobIf you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary. NeilAnd finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling. Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it’s time to say goodbye. Find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, goodbye. Rob Bye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello.

The letter is X.因为你一直在提供所有不那么微妙的线索。字母是 X。 Rob(罗伯)Yes. Exactly.是的。完全。 Neil(尼尔)Alright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let’s have a question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? Any ideas Rob?好吧，我想我们明白了！在我们进一步讨论之前，让我们有一个问题。英语有 26 个字母。哪种语言有 74 个字母？a） 高棉语（柬埔寨语） b） 印地语或 c） 亚美尼亚语？有什么想法吗 罗伯？ Rob (罗伯 )An excellent question but quite obscure, I’m going to say b) Hindi.一个很好的问题，但相当晦涩难懂，我要说 b） 印地语。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I’ll have the answer later on. Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?好吧，我稍后会给出答案。现在，罗伯，消息末尾的字母 X 本身是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.嗯，意思是一个吻。亲吻越多，你表现出的爱意就越多。 Neil(尼尔)Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from?用 X 表示亲吻的概念从何而来？Laura Wright 博士来自剑桥大学英语学院，她出现在 BBC Radio 4 节目 Word of Mouth 中。她说这种做法是什么时候开始的，它来自哪里？ Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge (LauraWright博士，剑桥大学英语学院 )Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans…嗯，至少从 1763 年开始，我们就一直在字母底部添加 X 来表示亲吻。我们所知道的第一个有 7 个 X。我不得不说我从来没有去过 7 岁。我们从罗马字母表中得到 X，而罗马字母表又从希腊字母表中得到 X，发音为 &#x2F;ks&#x2F; 和罗马字母…… Presenter:(主持人：)That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there.这几乎是一个吻，不是吗？是的，不是吗？我想那里只是掉了一分钱。 Presenter:(主持人：)It has, clunk.它有，笨拙。 Neil (尼尔 )What do we learn about the origins of the X for kisses?关于亲吻 X 的起源，我们了解了什么？ Rob(罗伯)Well, it’s been used since at least 1763 and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks.嗯，它至少从 1763 年开始就被使用，它来自罗马字母，他们从希腊人那里得到它。 Neil(尼尔)And why did this come to mean a kiss?为什么这变成了一个吻呢？ Rob(罗伯)Well, Dr Wright suggests it’s because of the original pronunciation - &#x2F;ks&#x2F;.嗯，Wright博士认为这是因为原来的发音–&#x2F;ks&#x2F;。 Neil(尼尔)And at the point the presenter made the connection, didn’t he?在主持人建立联系的那一刻，他不是吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, he did. And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped.是的，他做到了。Wright博士用了一个短语来形容某人突然理解了某件事，特别是对其他人来说很明显的事情。她说，一分钱刚刚掉了。 Neil(尼尔)And this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk.这与一分钱无关，一分钱是小硬币，实际上会掉到任何地方。但是主持人用了一个词来开玩笑，我们用它来表示东西掉落的声音，咔嚓咔嚓。 Rob(罗伯)Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example.虽然，老实说，一分钱永远不会真正叮当作响。这更像是两个沉重的金属物体发出的噪音 - 例如，车门的叮当声。 Neil(尼尔)Let’s listen to that exchange again.让我们再听一遍那次交流。 Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge (LauraWright博士，剑桥大学英语学院 )Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever.

It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?在通信末尾放置 X 需要注意的一点是，它不是你为所有人做的事情。它通常只对朋友和家人，你在现实生活中可能会亲吻的人。布里斯托大学的 Nils Langer 教授讲述了一个关于他的一位同事的故事，这位同事对这个惯例不太熟悉。她犯了什么错误？ Professor Nils Langer, University of Bristol(NilsLanger教授，布里斯托大学)A colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs.我一个来自布里斯托尔的同事，当她从德国过来时，她认为 X 只是在英国结束一封信的正常方式，因此她会用 X 结束任何一封信，甚至是一封给税务局的信。我们从未真正听说过税务局如何用这些 X 来回应这些信件。 Presenter:(主持人：)They docked her another 20 quid, I think!我想，他们又给她停了 20 英镑！ Neil(尼尔)What was her mistake, Rob?她犯了什么错误，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)She didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax.她没有意识到你不会在每一次通信上都打 X。因此，她甚至将其写在商业信函上，包括一封给英国税务局的政府部门。 Neil(尼尔)We don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been.我们不知道税务人员对这封带有亲吻的信有何感想。但主持人开玩笑说他们的反应会是什么。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound.是的，他开玩笑说他们可能又给她停了 20 英镑。To dock money 是减少您期望收到的金额，而 quid 是英镑的俚语。 Neil (尼尔 )Time now for the answer to our question.

RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilAnd in this programme we’re discussing food. RobFood glorious food! There’s only one thing better than talking about food and that’s eating it. NeilWell I know you are a bit of a gastronome – someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – but today we’re talking about photographing food, not eating it. RobThat is a shame because I am on a see-food diet – if I see food, I have to eat it. Get it?! NeilYes Rob, very very funny. But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food not eating it is big business as I will explain shortly. But shall we feast on a question first Rob? RobYes, if it tastes good! NeilIt does. So, do you know the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef RobHmm, I’m not a chef expert but I’ll say c) a Sous Chef – it sounds important! NeilWell I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes. RobAnd I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant. NeilWhich isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it! RobYou could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product. NeilMaybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend? Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar ChickIt sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose. NeilRebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words. RobYes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything. NeilAnd that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food. RobYes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant. NeilNow, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens… Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of OxfordWe see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience. NeilRight so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food. RobAnd expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen. NeilRight Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef What did you say, Rob? RobI said c) a Sous chef. Am I right? NeilYou are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen! RobCome on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me! NeilMaybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think. RobWe also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil? NeilAbsolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it? RobVery nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme! NeilWell let’s hope so! RobYes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms. See you soon, bye. NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)And in this programme we’re discussing food.在这个节目中，我们讨论的是食物。 Rob(罗伯)Food glorious food!

These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes.好吧，我将在节目的后面给出答案。现在让我更多地解释一下食物和照片。如今，一道菜（即准备食用的食物的名词）被拍摄得有多好，比它的实际味道更重要。 Rob(罗伯)And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant.我想社交媒体平台是分享美食照片的最佳方式，不是吗？我一直在用智能手机拍下我的食物照片而感到内疚 —— 但仅限于在一家豪华餐厅吃一些美味的食物时。 Neil(尼尔)Which isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it!我想这并不常见！但是通过在社交媒体上分享图片，人们看到它们并认为食物看起来很美味，我必须去那家餐厅吃！ Rob(罗伯)You could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product.你可以说这是关于风格而不是内容，这意味着某物的外观比内容或产品更好。 Neil(尼尔)Maybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?也许吧，罗伯 – 尽管我敢肯定有时食物的味道和看起来一样好。无论如何，BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours 一直在调查这个问题。他们与几位有影响力的 Instagram 用户和博主进行了交谈 —— 有影响力意味着有能力让人们改变他们的想法。这是其中之一 – Rebecca Milford，她编辑了一个名为 Bar Chick 的网站。她如何看待这一新趋势？ Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar Chick(RebeccaMilford，BarChick编辑)It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose.一张图片胜过千言万语听起来很陈词滥调，但确实如此，我现在有朋友了，而不是像以前那样去餐厅的网站看看他们提供什么，然后你会去他们的 Instagram 帐户查看他们的图片， 然后根据你所看到的从字面上选择你想吃的东西。所以我想它必须像样。 Neil(尼尔)Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words.Rebecca 在那里使用了一句广为人知且使用广为人知的短语 —— 这个短语被使用得如此之多，以至于变得无聊 —— 我们称之为陈词滥调。这句话是一张图片胜过千言万语。 Rob(罗伯)Yes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything.是的 – 即使这是陈词滥调 – 它确实如此。您在一篇长博客中描述了一顿美妙的饭菜，但您可以从图片中快速看到它的外观，然后在脑海中创造一个关于它的味道的想法。因此，当您推广美食时，照片就是一切。 Neil(尼尔)And that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food.这就是为什么一些餐馆向公关公司支付大量资金来拍摄可以在社交媒体上分享的时尚照片。这就像是一次美食的时尚摄影。 Rob(罗伯)Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant.是的，Rebecca 说食物必须像样 —— 看起来足够好，让人们看到 —— 因为人们会根据他们看到的东西做出选择。我还听说一些厨师和餐馆老板已经调整了他们的菜单，制作出在智能手机相机上看起来不错的饭菜。顺便说一句，餐馆老板是拥有和管理餐厅的人的名字。 Neil(尼尔)Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens…现在，虽然社交媒体账户（如 Instagram）上的好看食物可能与它的味道不匹配，但有一种理论可能会欺骗你，让你认为它确实很好吃。You and Yours 节目还听取了牛津大学实验心理学家 Charles Spence 教授关于这一切是如何发生的…… Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of Oxford(CharlesSpence，牛津大学实验心理学家)We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience.我们首先看到食物，或者玻璃杯中的饮料，我们的大脑已经在想象它的味道会是什么样子。它呈现得越精美，就越具有艺术性，这设定了更好的期望，它们在某种程度上延续并锚定了品尝体验。 Neil(尼尔)Right so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food.是的，一张很棒的食物照片可能会让我们觉得它的味道更好。我们在脑海中创造了一个关于食物味道的想法，这会影响我们实际食用食物时的期望。 Rob(罗伯)And expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen.而期望意味着感觉好事将要发生。 Neil(尼尔)Right Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef What did you say, Rob?好的，罗伯，我相信你期待我之前给你的问题的答案。我问道，你是否知道通常在餐厅厨房中仅次于主厨并承担很多经营责任的人的名字？是……a） 糕点师 b） 助理厨师 c） 副厨师长 罗伯，你说什么？ Rob(罗伯)I said c) a Sous chef. Am I right?我说 c） 副厨师长。我说得对吗？ Neil(尼尔)You are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen!你是 罗伯！给那个人一份工作，也许在 BBC 食堂！ Rob(罗伯)Come on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me!来吧，尼尔，我想我可以做得更好！但在我这样做之前，让我们提醒自己我们今天讨论的一些词汇。从 gastronome 开始 - 那是一个喜欢并且对高品质食物非常了解的人 - 像我这样的人！ Neil(尼尔)Maybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think.也许吧，罗伯。我们还讨论了 influential 这个词，意思是有能力让人们改变他们的想法。 Rob(罗伯)We also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil?我们还提到了陈词滥调 —— 一个众所周知的短语，它被过度使用以至于变得无聊。例如，“一张图片胜过千言万语”。你从来不用陈词滥调，对吧，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Absolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it?绝对不会。让我们继续讨论 Presentable – 它描述了看起来不错、很聪明并且足够让人们看到的东西。有点像我穿着我漂亮的新毛衣。喜欢吗？ Rob(罗伯)Very nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme!很好！嗯，主持人必须得体，Neil！我们的下一个词是 expectation，这个词描述了好事即将发生的感觉。我期望人们会喜欢这个项目！ Neil(尼尔)Well let’s hope so!好吧，让我们希望如此！ Rob(罗伯)Yes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilCatherine, I’m going to start this programme with a quick test, just for you. CatherineOoo, I love tests! NeilComplete this phrase: Wake up and smell the… CatherineCoffee Neil! It’s coffee. I have to say, I love coffee, it’s great. NeilOK, so do you drink much? CatherineWell, just a couple of cups, you know. NeilEvery day? CatherineNo, every hour! I love coffee, don’t you like coffee, Neil? NeilI do but maybe not as much as you! What’s the best thing about it? CatherineIt’s the smell. It’s got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it’s great isn’t it? NeilYes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it? CatherineWell no, not really. It’s always a little disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one. NeilOK, you’ve had quite a lot of coffee today, haven’t you? CatherineJust the usual six cups. NeilWell, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today’s question. The world’s biggest producer of coffee is… CatherineBrazil! Brazil! NeilYes, yes, but that’s not the question. The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia CatherineRight, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right? NeilOK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is? Tim Hayward, Coffee shop ownerIt’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses. NeilSo how important is it? CatherineI’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important. NeilAnd he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away? CatherineWell, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me. NeilCan you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go? CatherineYes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee. NeilDon’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience? CatherineThe effect of the lid? NeilYes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids. Tim HaywardWhat baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird. NeilSo what is he describing there? CatherineI see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience. NeilYes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again. Tim HaywardWhat baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird. NeilThat was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward. Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said? CatherineI said it was a: Colombia. NeilAh, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine. CatherineSo the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential. NeilNext we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee. CatherineSomething that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it. NeilYou might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange. CatherineAnd finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name. NeilWell that is the end of our programe. For more from us, check out Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye.

The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia是的，是的，但这不是问题。问题是，巴西是最大的咖啡生产国，而巴西是第二大咖啡生产国？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Right, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right?是的，这不是巴西，但我敢打赌这是另一个南美国家，所以我会去哥伦比亚。哥伦比亚，对吗？ Neil(尼尔)OK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is?好的，我们将在节目的后面有答案，到那时，也许咖啡因已经离开了你的身体，凯瑟琳。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 是一位咖啡店老板。他出现在 BBC Radio 4 节目 The Kitchen Cabinet 中。他说咖啡的味道有多重要？ Tim Hayward, Coffee shop owner(TimHayward，咖啡店老板)It’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses.这绝对至关重要，这是关键。当你早上走进咖啡店时，那股气味袭来，你就会产生生理反应。 Neil(尼尔)So how important is it?那么它有多重要呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important.我现在感觉平静了一些。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 说，咖啡的气味至关重要。这意味着它非常重要，也许是最重要的事情。他支持这一点，说这是关键。关键是必不可少的东西，它真的很重要。 Neil(尼尔)And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?他说，当你体验到这种气味时，当气味袭来时，你会得到一种生理反应。这句话的意思是你的身体对咖啡的气味有反应。也许你的嘴巴开始在期待中流口水。Catherine，当你喝咖啡时，你通常会把它放在那儿还是带走？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me.嗯，我通常会把它带走，但如果我真的觉得需要一杯咖啡，我可能会在那里喝一杯，然后再买一杯带走。 Neil(尼尔)Can you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go?您能描述一下当您喝咖啡外带时给您的容器吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.是的，它装在一个带盖的高纸杯里。盖子上有一个洞，这样我就可以喝那杯可爱的咖啡了。 Neil(尼尔)Don’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience?你不觉得这是个问题吗？我的意思是，我们知道气味有多重要，那么盖子对这种体验有什么影响呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)The effect of the lid?盖子的效果？ Neil(尼尔)Yes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids.是的。好吧，这是 Tim Hayward 再次谈论带盖咖啡。 Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.让我感到困惑的是，有多少大型咖啡连锁店实际上销售的是带有去除气味的杯子产品。所以你走进咖啡店，你会闻到气味，但当你真正把饮料拿出来时，你是在用一种旨在将热液体直接通过你的舌头，但阻止任何气味进入你的鼻子的东西喝它。这太奇怪了。 Neil(尼尔)So what is he describing there?那么他在那里描述了什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience.我现在明白了，是的，他说的是大型咖啡连锁店。连锁店是一家在城镇和城市拥有大量门店的公司，有时遍布世界各地。我想我们都能想到几家知名的咖啡连锁店。他说，通过在外卖杯上盖上盖子，你实际上是在阻挡气味 —— 这种气味对咖啡体验非常重要。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again.是的，他说他觉得这很奇怪，这是他觉得不寻常的一种方式，认为这很奇怪，很奇怪。以至于他说这让他感到困惑。如果你对某件事感到困惑，你会觉得它很困惑，你无法真正理解它。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 又来了。 Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.让我感到困惑的是，有多少大型咖啡连锁店实际上销售的是带有去除气味的杯子产品。所以你走进咖啡店，你会闻到气味，但当你真正把饮料拿出来时，你是在用一种旨在将热液体直接通过你的舌头，但阻止任何气味进入你的鼻子的东西喝它。这太奇怪了。 Neil(尼尔)That was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward. Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said?那是咖啡店老板蒂姆·海沃德（Tim Hayward）。在我们又来了解本周的词汇之前，让我们来了解一下这个问题的答案。在巴西之后，哪个国家的咖啡产量最多？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚 凯瑟琳，你说的？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I said it was a: Colombia.我说是：哥伦比亚。 Neil(尼尔)Ah, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine.啊，对不起，今天没有额外的咖啡给你！答案是越南。现在我们来看一下词汇。把它带走凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential.所以第一个词是 vital，这是一个形容词，意思是非常重要。另一个含义非常相似的词是 key，意思是必不可少的。 Neil(尼尔)Next we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee.接下来，我们有 physiological responses 这个短语。生理是指我们的身体所做的事情，而反应是一种反应。因此，生理反应是您的身体对某物的反应，例如咖啡的气味。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Something that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it.让你困惑、困惑、你不理解的东西。 Neil(尼尔)You might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange.你可能会发现一些让你感到困惑的事情很奇怪。这个形容词的意思是不寻常或奇怪。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name.最后，连锁店是来自同一家公司、同名的一组商店。 Neil(尼尔)Well that is the end of our programe.

CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilCatherine, what’s the connection between hierarchies, managers and chickens? CatherineWell, I don’t know Neil, but I’m, sure you’re going to tell me. NeilFirst of all, could you explain for our listeners what a hierarchy is? CatherineOf course! A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work! NeilBut where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine? CatherineWell, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371. NeilWell, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock. Margaret HeffernanHe compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work. NeilWhich flock was most successful? CatherineWell, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful. NeilYes, but why was that? CatherineWell, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them. NeilSo, what do we learn from this experiment? CatherineWell, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers. NeilBut there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again. Margaret HeffernanSo chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them. NeilSo, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens? CatherineWell, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves. NeilPecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate? CatherineWell, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens. NeilRight, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine? CatherineI said 371. NeilWell, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right! CatherineThat’s a lot of eggs! NeilIndeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance. CatherineAn expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy. NeilA group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens. CatherineAnother of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done. NeilAnd if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be. CatherineAnd finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people. For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel. NeilWell that is the end of the programme.

CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And I’m Catherine.我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)Catherine, what’s the connection between hierarchies, managers and chickens?Catherine，等级制度、管理者和鸡之间有什么联系？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I don’t know Neil, but I’m, sure you’re going to tell me.嗯，我不认识 Neil，但我确信你会告诉我的。 Neil(尼尔)First of all, could you explain for our listeners what a hierarchy is?首先，您能为我们的听众解释一下什么是层次结构吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Of course! A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work!答案是肯定的！等级制度是一种组织人员的方式。例如，在一家公司中，有不同级别的人。你有老板、经理和工人。工人做工作，经理开会阻止工人做工作！ Neil(尼尔)But where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine?但是鸡从哪里来呢？我们很快就会知道，但首先是今天的问题，它是 —— 惊喜，惊喜 —— 关于鸡。一只鸡一年产下的创纪录的鸡蛋数量是多少？是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你怎么看 凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371.嗯，我认为大多数鸡每天下一次蛋，所以我认为是 371。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock.好吧，我们将在节目的后面给出答案。现在，对于层次结构和鸡。在 Somethin’ Else 为 BBC 制作的广播节目 The Joy of 9 to 5 中，企业家 Margaret Heffernan 描述了一项实验。在这个实验中，研究人员比较了一组普通鸡和一组超级鸡的产蛋量。那是产蛋量高于平均水平的鸡。哪个最成功？这是 Margaret Heffernan，顺便说一句，一群鸡的名词是一群鸡。 Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)He compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work.他将这两个羊群进行了六代的比较。普通的羊群变得越来越好。产蛋量急剧增加。超级鸡的超级群，在六代结束时，除了三个之外，其他都死了，因为其他三个已经杀死了其余的。他们通过压制其他人的生产力来实现自己的个人生产力。这就是我们在工作中所做的。 Neil(尼尔)Which flock was most successful?哪个鸡群最成功？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful.嗯，超级鸡群实际上是互相残杀的，所以事实证明，普通鸡群总共产下更多的蛋，而且更成功。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, but why was that?是的，但为什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them.好吧，超级鸡一定把他们的其他鸡群成员看作不是同事，而是竞争对手。现在要理解这一点，我们必须从生产力这个词开始。这个名词指的是完成的工作量。因此，在个体层面上，超级鸡之所以能提高生产力，是因为它们抑制了鸡群成员的生产力。这里的 suppressed 意味着他们通过杀死其他鸡来“阻止其他鸡生产”。 Neil(尼尔)So, what do we learn from this experiment?那么，我们从这个实验中学到了什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers.Margaret Heffernan 认为，我们在人类工作场所看到了这种行为。当每个人都平等时，生产力会很高，但是一旦有等级制度 —— 只要有经理 —— 事情就会出错，因为并非所有经理都认为他们的角色是让员工的生活更轻松。他们通过干扰工人的生产力来展示他们作为管理者的生产力。 Neil(尼尔)But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again.但还有其他实验表明，鸡在等级制度中是有生产力的。不过，这些层次结构有何不同？玛格丽特·赫弗南 又来了。 Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)So chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them.所以鸡有一个内置的，或者如果你愿意的话，有一个继承的层次结构 - 这就是我们得到术语 啄食顺序 的地方。但这是他们自己创造的，而不是强加给他们的。 Neil(尼尔)So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?那么，至少对鸡来说，哪种层次结构是有效的呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves.嗯，最好的等级制度是没有强加的等级制度。这意味着良好的等级制度不会强加给鸡。自然，当他们自己创建层次结构时，他们会做得很好。他们自己制定啄食顺序。 Neil(尼尔)Pecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate?啄食顺序是一个很棒的短语。我们用它来描述组织中的重要性级别。你越重要，你的啄食顺序就越高。这句话从何而来？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens.嗯，啄是指鸡用喙做什么。他们用它们打或咬其他鸡。而最重要或占主导地位的鸡，啄所有其他鸡。最上面的鸡会啄所有的东西，中等等级的鸡会被啄食并自己做一些啄食，有些鸡只被其他鸡啄食。所以，鸡的啄食顺序是明确的。 Neil(尼尔)Right, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine?好了，是时候复习本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解一下测验的答案。我问一只鸡一年产蛋的记录数量是多少。选项是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你说什么，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I said 371.我说 371。 Neil(尼尔)Well, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right!好吧，你很幸运！你绝对是排名靠前的，不是吗？因为你是对的！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s a lot of eggs!好多鸡蛋啊！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance.事实上。现在，词汇。我们谈论的是等级制度 - 一种组织具有不同重要性的社会或工作场所的方式。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)An expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy.具有相似含义的表达是 peking order，它与某人或一只鸡在层次结构中的重要性有关。 Neil(尼尔)A group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens.一群鸡是一群鸡。它也是 birds 的通用集体名词，而不仅仅是 chickens。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Another of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done.我们的另一个词是名词 productivity，它指的是完成的工作量。 Neil(尼尔)And if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be.如果你压制某人的生产力，你就会阻止他们尽可能地提高他们的生产力。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people. For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel.最后，还有动词 to impose。如果你强加了什么，你就把它强加给人们。例如，政府对燃料征收新的税。 Neil(尼尔)Well that is the end of the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. SamAnd I’m Sam. NeilAnd we are sitting here in New Broadcasting House, in the middle of London. Would you say, Sam, that this is an isolated place? SamOh no, not at all. Isolated means far away from other places and people. NeilDoes that mean then, do you think, that you can’t be lonely here, with all these people around and all these things to do? SamAh, good question. Can you be lonely in a crowd? Yes, of course, I think you can be because being lonely isn’t about physical isolation. I think you can be lonely anywhere if you feel that you are disconnected from the world around you, if you feel that no one understands you. If you are living happily in isolation in The Scottish Highlands, for example, I’m sure you could feel lonely if you came here to London. NeilWell, loneliness is today’s topic. The BBC has just completed a big survey about it which we will learn more about shortly. But first, of course, a question: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet - by which I mean the place furthest away from anywhere else with the fewest people living there. Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert, or is it c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What do you think, Sam? SamI’ve got absolutely no idea, so this is just a guess - I think it’s the one in Antarctica. I’m going to go with that. NeilWell, we’ll have the answer later on in the programme. Loneliness is seen as a big problem for the mental health of the population, so much so that the British government has a minister for loneliness. But which age group suffers most from loneliness. Here is a BBC report about the research. James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondentThere is a common stereotype that loneliness affects only the old and the isolated. It does, but what this experiment also shows is that loneliness is felt throughout life. People aged between 16 and 24 experience loneliness more often and more intensely than any other age group. NeilSo according to the research, Sam, which section of society is most affected by loneliness? SamThis might be a surprise, but it’s 16 to 24 year olds. NeilI was surprised by that because like many, I would’ve guessed that it was older people. SamThe reporter did say that that was a stereotype. A stereotype is nothing to do with stereo music, but it’s the noun we use to describe a very simple and basic judgement of someone and their character and personality based on their age, nationality, profession and so on. So a stereotype of British people is that we can’t cook, we have bad teeth, we are very reserved and never say what we mean. NeilI don’t know what you mean, my cooking is wonderful, Sam. And the stereotype is that old people get lonely. SamMuch like the stereotypes of British people, this may be true in some cases - I’ve eaten some of your home-cooked meals remember, Neil - but it’s not true for the majority. It is young people who feel lonely more often and more intensely. Intensely here means strongly. The feeling of loneliness is stronger in young people than older people. NeilThe reporter goes on to give some explanation for why young people might be more lonely. James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondentResearchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data, suggested feeling lonely may plague the young because it’s a time of identity change. Figuring out your place in the world and of learning to regulate emotions. NeilHe says that feeling lonely may plague young people, what does he mean there? SamIf you are plagued by something, it means that it troubles you, it bothers you and not just once, it’s something that happens continually or repeatedly. NeilAnd he says this may be because at that age we are still figuring out our place in the world. We are trying to understand the world and what we are supposed to do with our lives. SamHe also suggests that younger people have not yet learned how to regulate their emotions, which is another way of saying to control their emotions. NeilRight. Time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet? Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert or c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What did you say, Sam? SamI said a). Neil Well, I’m afraid to say the answer is actually c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. It has a population of fewer than 300 and it’s only accessible by a 6-day voyage by ship from South Africa. SamSo not a popular place for a weekend break! NeilIndeed not. Now it’s time for a recap of our vocabulary. The first word was isolated which Tristan da Cunha certainly is. It means far away from other place and people. SamThen there was stereotype the noun for a simplistic view of person or group based on their nationality, age, profession and the like. NeilIntensely means strongly. SamBeing plagued by something means it causes you problems and difficulties. NeilIf you are trying to figure something out, you are trying to understand it. SamAnd to regulate something means to control it. NeilWell, sadly, that’s the end of the programme. Hopefully you won’t feel too lonely without us, remember we are always here on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye. SamBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Sam(山姆)And I’m Sam.我是 Sam。 Neil(尼尔)And we are sitting here in New Broadcasting House, in the middle of London. Would you say, Sam, that this is an isolated place?我们现在坐在伦敦市中心的新广播大楼。山姆，你会说这是一个偏僻的地方吗？ Sam(山姆)Oh no, not at all. Isolated means far away from other places and people.哦，不，一点也不。孤立意味着远离其他地方和人。 Neil(尼尔)Does that mean then, do you think, that you can’t be lonely here, with all these people around and all these things to do?那么，你认为这是否意味着，你在这里不会孤独，周围有这么多人，有这么多事情要做？ Sam(山姆)Ah, good question. Can you be lonely in a crowd? Yes, of course, I think you can be because being lonely isn’t about physical isolation. I think you can be lonely anywhere if you feel that you are disconnected from the world around you, if you feel that no one understands you. If you are living happily in isolation in The Scottish Highlands, for example, I’m sure you could feel lonely if you came here to London.啊，好问题。你会在人群中感到孤独吗？是的，当然，我认为你可以，因为孤独不是身体上的孤立。我认为，如果你觉得自己与周围的世界脱节，如果你觉得没有人理解你，那么你在任何地方都会感到孤独。例如，如果你在苏格兰高地快乐地与世隔绝地生活，我相信如果你来到伦敦，你会感到孤独。 Neil(尼尔)Well, loneliness is today’s topic. The BBC has just completed a big survey about it which we will learn more about shortly. But first, of course, a question: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet - by which I mean the place furthest away from anywhere else with the fewest people living there. Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert, or is it c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What do you think, Sam?嗯，孤独是今天的话题。BBC 刚刚完成了一项关于它的大型调查，我们很快就会了解更多信息。但首先，当然，一个问题：地球上最孤立的有人居住的地方在哪里 —— 我指的是离其他任何地方最远、居住在那里的人最少的地方。是：a） 南极洲的麦克默多站；b） 埃及西部沙漠的锡瓦绿洲，还是 c） 南大西洋的特里斯坦达库尼亚岛 山姆，你怎么看？ Sam(山姆)I’ve got absolutely no idea, so this is just a guess - I think it’s the one in Antarctica. I’m going to go with that.我完全不知道，所以这只是一个猜测 - 我认为它是南极洲的那个。我要接受这个。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll have the answer later on in the programme. Loneliness is seen as a big problem for the mental health of the population, so much so that the British government has a minister for loneliness. But which age group suffers most from loneliness. Here is a BBC report about the research.好吧，我们稍后会在节目中给出答案。孤独被视为人们心理健康的一个大问题，以至于英国政府设立了一位孤独大臣。但是哪个年龄段的人最容易受到孤独的影响。这是 BBC 关于这项研究的报道。 James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondent(詹姆斯·加拉格尔，BBC 健康与科学记者)There is a common stereotype that loneliness affects only the old and the isolated. It does, but what this experiment also shows is that loneliness is felt throughout life. People aged between 16 and 24 experience loneliness more often and more intensely than any other age group.有一个普遍的刻板印象，即孤独只影响老年人和孤立的人。确实如此，但这个实验还表明，孤独贯穿一生。16 至 24 岁的人比任何其他年龄段的人都更频繁、更强烈地感到孤独。 Neil(尼尔)So according to the research, Sam, which section of society is most affected by loneliness?那么根据研究，山姆，社会上哪个阶层受孤独的影响最大呢？ Sam(山姆)This might be a surprise, but it’s 16 to 24 year olds.这可能是一个惊喜，但这是 16 到 24 岁的年轻人。 Neil(尼尔)I was surprised by that because like many, I would’ve guessed that it was older people.我对此感到惊讶，因为和许多人一样，我会猜到是老年人。 Sam(山姆)The reporter did say that that was a stereotype. A stereotype is nothing to do with stereo music, but it’s the noun we use to describe a very simple and basic judgement of someone and their character and personality based on their age, nationality, profession and so on. So a stereotype of British people is that we can’t cook, we have bad teeth, we are very reserved and never say what we mean.记者确实说这是一种刻板印象。刻板印象与立体声音乐无关，但它是我们用来描述根据年龄、国籍、职业等对某人及其性格和个性的非常简单和基本的判断的名词。所以对英国人的刻板印象是，我们不会做饭，我们的牙齿不好，我们非常内向，从不说我们的意思。 Neil(尼尔)I don’t know what you mean, my cooking is wonderful, Sam. And the stereotype is that old people get lonely.我不知道你的意思，我的厨艺真棒，山姆。刻板印象是老年人会感到孤独。 Sam(山姆)Much like the stereotypes of British people, this may be true in some cases - I’ve eaten some of your home-cooked meals remember, Neil - but it’s not true for the majority. It is young people who feel lonely more often and more intensely. Intensely here means strongly. The feeling of loneliness is stronger in young people than older people.就像英国人的刻板印象一样，在某些情况下可能是真的 —— 记住，尼尔，我吃过你的一些家常菜 —— 但对大多数人来说并非如此。年轻人感到孤独的频率更高、更强烈。这里的 intensely 意思是强烈。年轻人的孤独感比老年人更强烈。 Neil(尼尔)The reporter goes on to give some explanation for why young people might be more lonely.记者继续解释了为什么年轻人可能更孤独。 James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondent(詹姆斯·加拉格尔，BBC 健康与科学记者)Researchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data, suggested feeling lonely may plague the young because it’s a time of identity change. Figuring out your place in the world and of learning to regulate emotions.曼彻斯特大学的研究人员分析了这些数据，他们认为孤独感可能会困扰年轻人，因为这是一个身份改变的时期。弄清楚你在世界上的位置并学习调节情绪。 Neil(尼尔)He says that feeling lonely may plague young people, what does he mean there?他说，孤独感可能会困扰年轻人，他这句话是什么意思？ Sam(山姆)If you are plagued by something, it means that it troubles you, it bothers you and not just once, it’s something that happens continually or repeatedly.如果你被某件事所困扰，这意味着它困扰着你，它困扰着你，而且不仅仅是一次，它是持续或反复发生的事情。 Neil(尼尔)And he says this may be because at that age we are still figuring out our place in the world. We are trying to understand the world and what we are supposed to do with our lives.他说这可能是因为在那个年龄，我们仍在弄清楚自己在世界上的位置。我们试图理解世界以及我们应该如何对待我们的生活。 Sam(山姆)He also suggests that younger people have not yet learned how to regulate their emotions, which is another way of saying to control their emotions.他还建议，年轻人还没有学会如何调节自己的情绪，这是控制自己情绪的另一种说法。 Neil(尼尔)Right. Time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet? Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert or c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What did you say, Sam?好的。是时候回顾一下本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解一下测验的答案。我问道：地球上最偏僻的有人居住的地方在哪里？是：a） 南极洲的麦克默多站；b） 埃及西部沙漠的锡瓦绿洲 或 c） 南大西洋的特里斯坦达库尼亚岛 山姆，你说什么？ Sam(山姆)I said a). Neil Well, I’m afraid to say the answer is actually c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. It has a population of fewer than 300 and it’s only accessible by a 6-day voyage by ship from South Africa.我说 a）。Neil：嗯，我不敢说答案实际上是 c） 南大西洋的 Tristan da Cunha 岛。它的人口不到 300 人，只能从南非乘船 6 天才能到达。 Sam(山姆)So not a popular place for a weekend break!所以不是周末度假的热门地方！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed not. Now it’s time for a recap of our vocabulary. The first word was isolated which Tristan da Cunha certainly is. It means far away from other place and people.确实不是。现在是时候回顾一下我们的词汇了。第一个词是孤立的，Tristan da Cunha 肯定是。它的意思是远离其他地方和人。 Sam(山姆)Then there was stereotype the noun for a simplistic view of person or group based on their nationality, age, profession and the like.然后是刻板印象，即根据国籍、年龄、职业等对个人或群体的简单化看法。 Neil(尼尔)Intensely means strongly.强烈意味着强烈。 Sam(山姆)Being plagued by something means it causes you problems and difficulties.被某事困扰意味着它会给你带来麻烦和困难。 Neil(尼尔)If you are trying to figure something out, you are trying to understand it.如果你试图弄清楚某件事，你就在试图理解它。 Sam(山姆)And to regulate something means to control it.而 to regulation something 的意思是控制它。 Neil(尼尔)Well, sadly, that’s the end of the programme.

SamObjectification can lead to issues in society such as inequality and discrimination. Objectification of women is a problem but what about the objectification of men? NeilBefore we hear more, it’s time for a question. Today’s question is: on British TV in which decade was a completely naked man first seen? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What do you think Sam? SamI’m going for the 60s. NeilI’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now Sam, do you know the TV programme Love Island? SamYes, it’s a kind of a dating show and all the contestants - men and women - spend a lot of time in their swimming costumes and they’ve all got perfect bodies. NeilYes, that’s right. It’s a programme that seems equally to objectify men and women equally. But is that a bad thing? Dr Peter Lucas is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire. He spoke on this topic on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. What does he suggest might be the advantage of featuring men with ‘perfect’ bodies? Dr Peter LucasIf you look at the impact of TV series like Love Island for instance, the producers of that programme present that as, have described that as being aspirational for their audience. It’s presenting role models, its presenting models that people are supposed to aspire to. Now many women, thinking about the male bodies that are on display there might think well, if it means that more men get off to the gym, look after themselves physically, surely that’s a good thing. NeilSo what might be an advantage of these highly fit athletic bodies on show? SamDr Lucas suggests that seeing those bodies might encourage men to go to the gym and work hard to improve their fitness and health and that could be a good thing. NeilYes, the people in the programme are described as role models. A role model is someone whose behaviour is seen as a good example for others to copy. SamI’m not sure the behaviour of the people in Love Island makes them good role models, but perhaps from the point of view of their physical fitness they give us something to aspire to. If you aspire to something, it’s something you can aim for, something you want to achieve. Dr Lucas also used a related word, aspirational. The TV series Love Island was described as being aspirational. It shows a lifestyle that people would like to have, something they might aim to achieve. NeilBut there are also dangers to encouraging people to get to the gym. Here’s Dr Lucas again. Dr Peter LucasBut also it’s likely to generate higher levels of narcissism, self-consciousness, becoming obsessive about your appearance. It’s not particularly an attractive feature either in men or in women and I suspect that’s impacting on men’s behaviour in a way which is detrimental in the same sort of way that’s been detrimental for women really, for decades. NeilHe talks about behaviour that is detrimental, this means behaviour that has a negative impact. What behaviours does he say are detrimental? SamIf people become obsessed by their appearance it could lead to narcissism. This is a condition where you spend so much time focussing on yourself, your own looks, your own body that you stop caring about anyone else. NeilAnd because it’s very very hard to get that kind of body it can also lead to people being very self-conscious. They might become embarrassed about their bodies and lose confidence in themselves as a result. Right. It’s almost time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have theanswer to the quiz. In what decade was the first naked man seen on British TV? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What did you say, Sam? SamI said c) the 60s. NeilI’m afraid the revolution had come earlier than that. The correct answer is the 1950s. It was a 1957 documentary called Out of Step, part of which was filmed at a nudist colony. Now, time for our vocabulary. SamOur first word was objectification. This is the noun for when we reduce a human being to an object. We don’t think of them as a real person anymore. The verb is to objectify. NeilSomeone whose behaviour is a good example that others want to copy is a role model. SamWhen it comes to presenting 6 Minute English, you are my role model, Neil. NeilYou’re too kind, and I aspire to your level of professionalism, Sam. To aspire to - to aim to be, to hope to achieve. SamThat is related to the next word, aspirational. This adjective is used to describe the desire to improve parts of you life - for example, getting a better job or a better body. Aspirational TV programmes or adverts show lifestyles that people might want to betheirs. NeilOur next word is an adjective for something that is bad for you, something that has a negative effect. The adjective is detrimental. SamWe heard that aspiring to the perfect body can be detrimental because it might lead to narcissism. Narcissism is the term for someone who is so obsessed with their own body and life that they don’t care about anyone else. NeilAchieving that perfect body is incredibly hard and impossible for most real people and not achieving it can make people overly self-conscious - which in this situation means that they can lose confidence in themselves. SamThat’s all we have time for today. Do join us next time and remember you can find us on the website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye bye. NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Sam(山姆)And I’m Sam.我是 Sam。 Neil(尼尔)And in this programme we’re looking at the word objectification.在这个节目中，我们关注的是物化这个词。 Sam(山姆)Objectification is when we reduce people to objects.物化是指我们将人简化为对象。 Neil(尼尔)An example of this is advertising and the media and in particular the way women have been shown. Impossibly attractive and implausibly perfect models in adverts and in movies and on TV you are much more likely to see naked or half-naked women than men.这方面的一个例子是广告和媒体，尤其是女性的展示方式。在广告、电影和电视中，你看到裸体或半裸女性的可能性要比男性高得多。 Sam(山姆)Objectification can lead to issues in society such as inequality and discrimination. Objectification of women is a problem but what about the objectification of men?物化会导致社会问题，例如不平等和歧视。物化女性是一个问题，但物化男性呢？ Neil(尼尔)Before we hear more, it’s time for a question. Today’s question is: on British TV in which decade was a completely naked man first seen? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What do you think Sam?在我们听到更多之前，是时候提出一个问题了。今天的问题是：在英国电视上，第一次看到一个全裸的男人是在哪个十年里？是不是……a） 1940 年代；b） 1950 年代 c） 1960 年代 你怎么看 Sam？ Sam(山姆)I’m going for the 60s.我要去 60 年代。 Neil(尼尔)I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now Sam, do you know the TV programme Love Island?我将在节目的后面给出答案。现在山姆，你知道电视节目《爱情岛》吗？ Sam(山姆)Yes, it’s a kind of a dating show and all the contestants - men and women - spend a lot of time in their swimming costumes and they’ve all got perfect bodies.是的，这是一种约会节目，所有的参赛者 - 男人和女人 - 都花了很多时间穿着泳衣，他们都有完美的身材。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, that’s right. It’s a programme that seems equally to objectify men and women equally. But is that a bad thing? Dr Peter Lucas is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire. He spoke on this topic on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. What does he suggest might be the advantage of featuring men with ‘perfect’ bodies?是的，没错。这个节目似乎平等地物化了男性和女性。但这是一件坏事吗？Peter Lucas 博士是中央兰开夏大学哲学高级讲师。他在 BBC 的 Woman’s Hour 节目中谈到了这个话题。他认为拥有“完美”身材的男性可能有什么优势？ Dr Peter Lucas(Peter Lucas 博士)If you look at the impact of TV series like Love Island for instance, the producers of that programme present that as, have described that as being aspirational for their audience. It’s presenting role models, its presenting models that people are supposed to aspire to. Now many women, thinking about the male bodies that are on display there might think well, if it means that more men get off to the gym, look after themselves physically, surely that’s a good thing.例如，如果你看一下像《爱情岛》这样的电视剧的影响，该节目的制片人将其描述为对他们的观众来说是令人向往的。它展示了榜样，它展示了人们应该向往的榜样。现在，许多女性，想到那里展示的男性身体，可能会想得很好，如果这意味着更多的男性去健身房，照顾好自己的身体，这肯定是一件好事。 Neil(尼尔)So what might be an advantage of these highly fit athletic bodies on show?那么，这些高度健康的运动身体可能有什么优势呢？ Sam(山姆)Dr Lucas suggests that seeing those bodies might encourage men to go to the gym and work hard to improve their fitness and health and that could be a good thing.卢卡斯博士建议，看到这些身体可能会鼓励男性去健身房并努力改善他们的健康和健康，这可能是一件好事。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, the people in the programme are described as role models. A role model is someone whose behaviour is seen as a good example for others to copy.是的，该计划中的人被描述为榜样。榜样是其行为被视为他人效仿的好榜样的人。 Sam(山姆)I’m not sure the behaviour of the people in Love Island makes them good role models, but perhaps from the point of view of their physical fitness they give us something to aspire to. If you aspire to something, it’s something you can aim for, something you want to achieve. Dr Lucas also used a related word, aspirational. The TV series Love Island was described as being aspirational. It shows a lifestyle that people would like to have, something they might aim to achieve.我不确定《爱情岛》中人们的行为是否使他们成为很好的榜样，但也许从他们的身体健康的角度来看，他们给了我们一些值得向往的东西。如果你渴望某事，那就是你可以瞄准的，你想要实现的。卢卡斯博士还使用了一个相关的词，即 aspirational。电视连续剧《爱情岛》被描述为令人向往。它展示了人们想要拥有的生活方式，他们可能旨在实现的生活方式。 Neil(尼尔)But there are also dangers to encouraging people to get to the gym. Here’s Dr Lucas again.但是，鼓励人们去健身房也有危险。又是 Lucas 博士。 Dr Peter Lucas(Peter Lucas 博士)But also it’s likely to generate higher levels of narcissism, self-consciousness, becoming obsessive about your appearance. It’s not particularly an attractive feature either in men or in women and I suspect that’s impacting on men’s behaviour in a way which is detrimental in the same sort of way that’s been detrimental for women really, for decades.但它也可能会产生更高水平的自恋、自我意识、对自己的外表产生强迫症。无论是在男性还是女性中，这都不是一个特别有吸引力的特征，我怀疑它正在以一种有害的方式影响男性的行为，就像几十年来对女性有害一样。 Neil(尼尔)He talks about behaviour that is detrimental, this means behaviour that has a negative impact. What behaviours does he say are detrimental?他谈到了有害的行为，这意味着具有负面影响的行为。他说哪些行为是有害的？ Sam(山姆)If people become obsessed by their appearance it could lead to narcissism. This is a condition where you spend so much time focussing on yourself, your own looks, your own body that you stop caring about anyone else.如果人们沉迷于自己的外表，可能会导致自恋。在这种情况下，你花了很多时间专注于自己、自己的外表、自己的身体，以至于你不再关心其他人。 Neil(尼尔)And because it’s very very hard to get that kind of body it can also lead to people being very self-conscious. They might become embarrassed about their bodies and lose confidence in themselves as a result.因为要获得这样的身体非常非常困难，它也会导致人们非常自我意识。他们可能会对自己的身体感到尴尬，并因此对自己失去信心。 Right. It’s almost time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the(好的。现在差不多该复习本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解)answer to the quiz. In what decade was the first naked man seen on British TV? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What did you say, Sam?回答测验。英国电视上的第一个裸体男人是在哪个十年里？是不是……a） 1940 年代；b） 1950 年代 c） 1960 年代 山姆，你说什么？ Sam(山姆)I said c) the 60s.我说 c） 60 年代。 Neil(尼尔)I’m afraid the revolution had come earlier than that. The correct answer is the 1950s. It was a 1957 documentary called Out of Step, part of which was filmed at a nudist colony. Now, time for our vocabulary.恐怕革命来得比那更早。正确答案是 1950 年代。这是一部 1957 年的纪录片，名为 Out of Step，其中一部分是在裸体主义者聚居地拍摄的。现在，是时候使用我们的词汇了。 Sam(山姆)Our first word was objectification. This is the noun for when we reduce a human being to an object. We don’t think of them as a real person anymore. The verb is to objectify.我们的第一个词是物化。这是当我们把一个人简化为一个物体时的名词。我们不再将他们视为真实的人。动词是 to objectify。 Neil(尼尔)Someone whose behaviour is a good example that others want to copy is a role model.如果一个人的行为是别人想要效仿的好榜样，那么他就是一个榜样。 Sam(山姆)When it comes to presenting 6 Minute English, you are my role model, Neil.在展示六分钟英语时，您是我的榜样，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)You’re too kind, and I aspire to your level of professionalism, Sam. To aspire to - to aim to be, to hope to achieve.你太善良了，我渴望达到你的专业水平，山姆。渴望 - 以成为为目标，希望实现。 Sam(山姆)That is related to the next word, aspirational. This adjective is used to describe the desire to improve parts of you life - for example, getting a better job or a better body.这与下一个词 aspirational 有关。这个形容词用于描述改善生活某些部分的愿望 - 例如，获得更好的工作或更好的身体。 Aspirational TV programmes or adverts show lifestyles that people might want to be(令人向往的电视节目或广告展示了人们可能想要的生活方式)theirs.他们。 Neil(尼尔)Our next word is an adjective for something that is bad for you, something that has a negative effect. The adjective is detrimental.我们的下一个词是一个形容词，表示对你有害的事物，对你有负面影响的事物。这个形容词是有害的。 Sam(山姆)We heard that aspiring to the perfect body can be detrimental because it might lead to narcissism. Narcissism is the term for someone who is so obsessed with their own body and life that they don’t care about anyone else.我们听说追求完美的身材可能是有害的，因为它可能会导致自恋。自恋是指那些如此痴迷于自己的身体和生活以至于不关心其他人的人。 Neil(尼尔)Achieving that perfect body is incredibly hard and impossible for most real people and not achieving it can make people overly self-conscious - which in this situation means that they can lose confidence in themselves.对于大多数真实的人来说，实现完美的身体是非常困难和不可能的，不达到它会使人们过度自我意识 —— 在这种情况下，这意味着他们会对自己失去信心。 Sam(山姆)That’s all we have time for today.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. NeilNow Rob, how creative are you? RobVery creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now. NeilYou are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively. RobCreativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer? NeilYes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl. RobI can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl. NeilOK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob! RobOf course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools? Bernadette Duffy, early years consultantWe focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future. NeilSo Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills. RobSo we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things. NeilBernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’. RobWell, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’. NeilRob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?! RobWell, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest? Nick Skillicorn, Innovation ManagerOn a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas. NeilSo we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas. RobDisparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions. NeilWell, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital. RobRight, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now. NeilAh yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl. RobAnd I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon. NeilNot quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted! RobWow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising. NeilThen we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably. RobNext we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal. NeilWe also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob! RobThanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated. And we talked about headspace, which is when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. NeilBefore we head off to find some headspace, don’t forget to visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more great learning English content. That’s all we have time for now. Do join us again though. Goodbye. RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Now Rob, how creative are you?现在 罗伯，你的创意如何？ Rob(罗伯)Very creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now.我认为非常有创意。创造力就在我的骨子里！看看我写的这个精彩的剧本，我们现在正在展示。 Neil(尼尔)You are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively.您就是我们可以称之为“创意者”的人 —— 一个名词，意思是具有丰富想象力和想法的人。在我们的工作中，我们必须创建或制作具有创造性英语教学的内容。 Rob(罗伯)Creativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?创造力对每个人来说都变得越来越重要。世界经济论坛预测，到 2020 年，创造力将成为未来工作最重要的三大技能之一。这对于即将进入职场的年轻人尤其重要，这就是我们今天要讨论的内容。但在我们这样做之前，Neil，您是否提出了一个问题让我们回答？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl.是的，这是关于非常有创造力的艺术家 Banksy 的。他创作了一件最近上了新闻的著名艺术品，但你知道它叫什么吗？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。 Rob(罗伯)I can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl.我可以在脑海中看到这幅画 —— 所以我认为它是 c） Balloon Girl。 Neil(尼尔)OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob!好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于创造力的讨论。专家表示，学生需要更多地关注创造力，以帮助他们找到工作。这在英国可能很令人惊讶，因为我们的一些创意产业 —— 例如制作音乐、艺术和电视的企业 —— 举世闻名。我们是有创造力的人，罗伯！ Rob(罗伯)Of course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?当然，但现在没有那么注重教育的创造力，这可能会在未来产生影响。这是早期教育顾问伯纳黛特·达菲 在 BBC Radio 4 的“培养英国”节目中一直在讨论的问题。她说我们在学校里太关注什么了？ Bernadette Duffy, early years consultant(Bernadette Duffy，早期教育顾问)We focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future.我们专注于合法重要的事情，但我们以一种更容易衡量的方式教授它们。我认为我们需要纠正这种平衡，这种平衡将重点纯粹放在获得技能上，而更多地放在以创造性的方式实际使用它们上，因为这将对未来产生影响。 Neil(尼尔)So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills.因此，Bernadette 认为我们以一种易于衡量和测试的方式教授技能。她说，我们合法地教授这些技能 —— 这里的意思是公平合理的。但她认为我们没有教授一种创造性的方法来学习技能。 Rob(罗伯)So we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things.所以我们指的是解决问题之类的事情。我想，即使是数据输入和准备电子表格等任务也可以创造性地完成。在任何工作中，有时“跳出框框思考”或寻找新的做事方式都是好的。 Neil(尼尔)Bernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’.Bernadette 认为我们应该从仅仅学习技能开始创造性地使用这些技能 —— 她使用了“redress the balance”这个词，意思是“改变事物，让它们更公平、更平等”。 Rob(罗伯)Well, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’.好吧，在 BBC，我们必须发挥创造力。事实上，我们的价值观之一就是“创造力是我们组织的命脉”。Lifeblood 在这里的意思是“使某事成功最重要的事情”。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?!罗伯，我能看出创造力流淌在你的血液中 —— 但在日常层面上，我们如何才能提高我们的创造力 —— 像你一样？！ Rob(罗伯)Well, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest?好吧，Neil，我不是专家，但创新经理 Nick Skillicorn 是。他还一直在接受 BBC 的采访，解释我们可以做些什么来帮助自己。他建议什么呢？ Nick Skillicorn, Innovation Manager(Nick Skillicorn，创新经理)On a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas.每天，每个人都应该花 15 分钟我所说的无重点时间 —— 他们不看任何屏幕的时间，他们基本上可以回到自己的脑海中，放慢一点速度，开始在不同的想法之间形成这些新的联系，从而导致不同的新原创想法。 Neil(尼尔)So we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas.因此，我们需要空闲时间在脑海中收集所有不同的想法 —— Nick 称之为不同的想法，以创造新的和令人惊叹的想法。 Rob(罗伯)Disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions.不同的想法是截然不同的想法，都是不相关的。我们需要我们所谓的头脑空间 – 那时你的大脑处于良好的状态，你可以清晰地思考。对我来说，当我躺在浴缸里或骑自行车时，我有头部空间 —— 不会被打扰。 Neil(尼尔)Well, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital.好吧，你肯定不会把你的想法放在办公桌前，专注于一项任务 —— 我们都需要一些休息时间来发挥创意。但是现在上学的孩子长大后会从事一份尚不存在的工作。面对人工智能、自动化、绿色问题和人口老龄化的挑战，创造力和想象力将至关重要。 Rob(罗伯)Right, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now.好了，好吧，现在让我们回到 Banksy 的创造力上来。 Neil(尼尔)Ah yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl.啊，是的，因为之前我问你最近他的哪一件知名作品上了新闻？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。 Rob(罗伯)And I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon.我说 c） 气球女孩。我知道那是一个女孩和一个气球。 Neil(尼尔)Not quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted!不太对劲，罗伯。这件作品的标题是“带气球的女孩”。这辆车最近在伦敦拍卖，但令人惊讶的是，由于有人的中标被接受，它被撕碎了！ Rob(罗伯)Wow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising.哇，这是一种非常有创意的销毁图片的方法！我很快就会对这个脚本做同样的事情，但在此之前，我们会回顾一下今天的一些词汇。从“创意人员”开始 - 其工作是发挥大量想象力并提出新想法的人，例如在媒体或广告行业工作的人。 Neil(尼尔)Then we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably.然后我们提到了 legimately – 它描述了公平合理地做某事。 Rob(罗伯)Next we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal.接下来，我们听到了“redress the balance”这个说法。这意味着让事情变得更公平、更平等。 Neil(尼尔)We also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob!我们还谈到了创造力是 BBC 的命脉。Lifeblood 在这里意味着使某事成功最重要的事情。我知道创造力在你的血管中流淌，罗伯！ Rob(罗伯)Thanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated. And we talked about headspace, which is when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly.谢谢，Neil。我们还听到了 disparate 这个词，意思是非常不同且不相关。我们谈到了顶空，即当你的大脑处于良好状态并且可以清晰思考时。 Neil(尼尔)Before we head off to find some headspace, don’t forget to visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more great learning English content.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. CatherineNow Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop? RobYes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity. CatherineExactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement? RobIt should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please! CatherineIt’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968? RobI’ll go for 1948. CatherineOK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too. RobIt’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd! CatherineWell, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start? Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily MirrorWell I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things. RobOK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style. CatherineYes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation. RobYes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends. CatherineWell Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress? RobOK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend? Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily MirrorIt’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there. RobWow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. CatherineNo don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing. RobAnd I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money. CatherineThe issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it. RobWell if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do. CatherineAnd there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? RobAnd I said 1948. CatherineAnd you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece. RobVery interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’. CatherineThen we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation. RobWe also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends. CatherineRummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’. RobWell you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like. The web address is bbclearningenglish.com. CatherineBut that’s all we have time for now. Join us again next time. Goodbye. RobBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Catherine。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop?现在 罗伯，你有没有在慈善商店买过东西？ Rob(罗伯)Yes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity.是的，我愿意。他们是讨价还价的好地方，我也向慈善商店捐赠物品。顺便说一句，慈善商店是人们拿走他们不需要的物品，然后商店出售它们并赚钱的商店，这些钱捐给了慈善机构。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Exactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement?“ 听到 罗伯 说这句话真是太好了，因为捐赠 —— 即向组织提供资金或物品 —— 有助于慈善机构筹集资金。您可能有兴趣知道，穿着二手衣服又回来了 —— 嗯 —— 这就是我们今天要讨论的内容 —— 看起来像你在慈善商店穿衣服是一种新的时尚宣言吗？ Rob(罗伯)It should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please!这应该很有趣，但首先，凯瑟琳，你不打算给我一个问题来回答吗 —— 请不要是二手问题！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)It’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968?罗伯，今天对于您和家里的听众来说，这是一个全新的问题 —— 您知道英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的吗？是在……a） 1928 年；b） 1948 年，还是 c） 1968 年？ Rob(罗伯)I’ll go for 1948.我会选择 1948 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too.好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于慈善商店和时尚的讨论。镇上出现了一种新的面貌，有些人称之为 “scumbro”。Scumbro 将“scummy”一词与“bro”一词相结合，“bro”一词是称呼男孩或男人的非正式方式。所以 scumbro 是男性的时尚 —— 但女性也可以采用它。 Rob(罗伯)It’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd!这个名字有点侮辱人，这种新时尚风格的奇怪之处在于：成为渣男就是购买昂贵的设计师品牌，这些品牌看起来像是来自慈善商店的。很奇怪！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start?嗯，这是 Amber Graafland 知道的事情。她是每日镜报的时尚与美容总监，她一直在向BBC广播4台的You and Yours节目讲述这一切。那么，这种趋势是如何开始的呢？ Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)Well I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things.嗯，我认为这个名字来自《名利场》的一篇文章，我想贾斯汀·比伯，要感谢乔纳·希尔等人，皮特·戴维森，他实际上是阿丽亚娜·格兰德的未婚妻 —— 他绝对是渣男的创始人之一。我认为，就像大多数这些趋势一样，它们是由名人发起的，然后，我的意思是，它已经被每个人的声音所接受。 Rob(罗伯)OK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style.好吧，时尚杂志《名利场》发明了这个名字，但这种趋势已经蔓延开来，因为名人一直在穿着这种风格。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.Yes and Amber 提到了一些名人，他们是这一趋势的奠基人 —— 这是一个用来描述提出想法或组织的人的术语。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends.是的，这种趋势已经被你描述为时尚受害者的人所接受或复制 —— 他们必须追随最新的时尚潮流。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress?好吧，罗伯，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 但我说，也许，有一天，我可能想看起来渣男 —— 或者可能是渣男！那么我到底应该怎么着装呢？ Rob(罗伯)OK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend?好的，让我们再次听到 Amber Graafland 的声音。她如何描述这种时尚潮流的特点？ Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)It’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there.这一切都与穿着这些价格过高的超大号衣服有关，我认为这不仅仅是看起来像你在青少年的装扮盒中翻找过。这些都是非常非常昂贵的商品 —— 你提到了 Prada、Versace、Gucci、Supreme 等品牌 —— 虽然基本上看起来你没有付出任何努力，但潜在的问题是你确实需要看到努力已经在那里。 Rob(罗伯)Wow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things.哇，这种时尚趋势确实需要付出很多努力！这不仅仅是看起来凌乱 —— 就像你在青少年的装扮盒里翻找一样。翻找是指您搜索与许多其他事物混合在一起的东西。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)No don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing.不，不要翻找！诀窍似乎是看起来你没有付出任何努力，但与此同时，你表明你已经付出了努力！这就是这个词的含义 – 同时做一件事和另一件事。 Rob(罗伯)And I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money.我想，通过表明你付出了努力，你佩戴了名牌 —— 表明你付出了很多钱。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)The issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it.这里的问题是慈善商店的衣服应该很便宜。有些人甚至购买这些衣服，因为这是他们能负担得起的 —— 但具有讽刺意味的是，有些人选择花很多很多钱来看起来像他们穿着二手衣服 —— 而慈善商店并没有从中赚到任何钱。 Rob(罗伯)Well if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do.好吧，如果你是时尚界的受害者，这是你必须做的事情。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK?我现在必须做一件事，那就是给你今天测验问题的答案。所以我刚才问你，英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的？ Rob(罗伯)And I said 1948.我说的是 1948 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece.本周你是对的，罗伯。干的好！第一家商店由慈善机构乐施会经营，于 1948 年在牛津开业，这是为了帮助战后希腊而发起的呼吁的直接结果。 Rob(罗伯)Very interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’.非常有趣。好吧，让我们提醒自己今天的一些词汇，从“捐赠”这个词开始，意思是“向组织或慈善机构捐赠物品或金钱”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Then we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.然后我们提到了开国元勋 —— 一个用来描述发起一个想法或组织的人的术语。 Rob(罗伯)We also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends.我们还提到，Catherine 不是时尚的受害者 —— 一个必须追随最新时尚潮流的人。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Rummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’.Rummaging 这个词形容寻找与许多其他事物混在一起的东西。然后我们有了 同时，这意味着“在做一件事的同时做另一件事”。 Rob(罗伯)Well you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like.

I’m Neil. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. NeilToday we’re talking about plastic. RobYes, it’s our addiction to plastic that is of concern because this material doesn’t decay very quickly, so once we’ve used it; it hangs around for a very long time. NeilIt is a problem – and decay, by the way, describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles. We hear so much about the consequences of having too much waste plastic around, don’t we? RobIndeed. Not only does it cause a mess - wildlife, particularly marine animals, are at risk when they become entangled in plastic waste, or ingest it. It’s an issue that needs tackling – or dealing with. And that’s what we’ll be discussing today and finding out what could be done to solve this plastic crisis. NeilOK, first, let’s challenge you to answer a question about plastic, Rob. The first synthetic plastic – that’s plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. Do you know what its brand name was? Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica? RobI’m no expert, so I’ll say c) Formica. NeilWell, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about plastic. This man-mad substance is everywhere - from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets. RobBut the problem is that most of it isn’t biodegradable – that’s a word that describes something that can decay naturally without harming anything. Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single-use. So why don’t we stop using it? NeilIt’s not that easy, Rob, and it’s something Lucy Siegle, a BBC reporter and author, has been talking about. She was speaking in a discussion on the Costing the Earth programme on BBC Radio 4, and explained the issue we have with quitting plastic but also how our attitude is changing… Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and authorWe have this weird psychological attachment to this material that’s been around and it’s like a push and pull. At the one time, we’re so horrified by what we’re seeing – the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic, beaming in from all over the world, and at the same time we’re being told we can’t live without it, so that creates a psychological dissonance –which I think is the barrier to behavioural change but I’m finding now awareness has peaked and it’s going over into activism. RobShe mentioned the word psychological – that’s something that affects or involves our mind – so here, psychological attachment means that in our mind we feel we have to use plastic – we’re addicted. NeilBut we also see the negative impact of plastic – like whales dying – and in our mind we’re also thinking we must stop! This has created what Lucy says is a ‘psychological dissonance’ - dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas – so we’re having an argument in our head about the right thing to do – this is the ‘push and pull’ of thoughts she referred to. RobAnd this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue – but now we’re starting to do something about it – we’re taking action to reduce our plastic waste – we’re turning to activism. That’s taking action to change something – it could be social or political change, or a change in our behaviour or attitude. NeilOf course there has been a big push – that means people have been strongly encouraged – to recycle. RobMaybe in an ideal world the best thing to do is go plastic-free – but that isn’t easy, is it? NeilNo, it isn’t, and it’s something Lucy Siegle spoke about. Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process. But where does she think we can make the biggest difference? Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and authorI really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life is easier and more effective in the long term, than trying to go plastic-free from the outset. We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture. RobShe says we have a supermarket culture in the UK. Culture here describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave – and in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets. NeilSo, for example, customers can make a big difference by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging. It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands – we need to be more careful about how and when we use it – and use our collective power to force change if it’s needed. RobBut there’s no doubt plastic is useful for many things so it will be a long time before it disappears altogether. NeilAnd earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic, invented over a 100 years ago. Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica? RobAnd I said c) Formica. Was I right? NeilFormica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas in kitchens – but it’s not the oldest type. That was Bakelite. RobI may have got that wrong but hopefully I’ll have more success recapping some of today’s vocabulary – starting with decay, which describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles – which plastic takes a long time to do. NeilNext we had biodegradable – that’s a word to describe something that can decay naturally without harming anything. RobThen we had psychological – that’s something that affects or involves your mind. NeilNext up, we had dissonance, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas. RobAnd then we mentioned activism - that’s taking action to change something. We also mentioned the phrase a big push which means people are strongly encouraged or persuaded to do something, usefully by force. NeilAnd finally we had culture. In our context of supermarket culture, it describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave. RobThanks, Neil.

I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟 English。我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Today we’re talking about plastic.今天我们谈论的是塑料。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, it’s our addiction to plastic that is of concern because this material doesn’t decay very quickly, so once we’ve used it; it hangs around for a very long time.是的，我们对塑料的依赖令人担忧，因为这种材料不会很快腐烂，所以一旦我们用过它；它会存在很长时间。 Neil(尼尔)It is a problem – and decay, by the way, describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles. We hear so much about the consequences of having too much waste plastic around, don’t we?这是一个问题 —— 顺便说一句，衰变描述了某物被破坏或分解成小颗粒的自然过程。我们听到了很多关于周围有太多废塑料的后果，不是吗？ Rob(罗伯)Indeed. Not only does it cause a mess - wildlife, particularly marine animals, are at risk when they become entangled in plastic waste, or ingest it. It’s an issue that needs tackling – or dealing with. And that’s what we’ll be discussing today and finding out what could be done to solve this plastic crisis.事实上。它不仅会造成混乱 —— 野生动物，尤其是海洋动物，当它们被塑料垃圾缠住或摄入时，它们就会处于危险之中。这是一个需要解决或处理的问题。这就是我们今天要讨论的内容，并找出可以做些什么来解决这场塑料危机。 Neil(尼尔)OK, first, let’s challenge you to answer a question about plastic, Rob. The first synthetic plastic – that’s plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. Do you know what its brand name was? Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica?好的，首先，让我们挑战您回答一个关于塑料的问题，罗伯。第一种合成塑料 - 完全由人造材料制成的塑料 - 是在 100 多年前创造的。你知道它的品牌名称是什么吗？是不是……a） 电木；b） 有机玻璃还是 c） 富美家？ Rob(罗伯)I’m no expert, so I’ll say c) Formica.我不是专家，所以我会说 c） 富美家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about plastic. This man-mad substance is everywhere - from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets.好吧，我们将在节目结束时揭晓答案。现在让我们更多地谈谈塑料。这种让人疯狂的物质无处不在 —— 从衣服到薯片包，从瓶子到桶。 Rob(罗伯)But the problem is that most of it isn’t biodegradable – that’s a word that describes something that can decay naturally without harming anything. Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single-use. So why don’t we stop using it?但问题是，其中大部分是不可生物降解的 —— 这个词用来描述可以自然腐烂而不会伤害任何东西的东西。每年生产 4 亿吨塑料，其中 40% 是一次性塑料。那么，我们为什么不停止使用它呢？ Neil(尼尔)It’s not that easy, Rob, and it’s something Lucy Siegle, a BBC reporter and author, has been talking about. She was speaking in a discussion on the Costing the Earth programme on BBC Radio 4, and explained the issue we have with quitting plastic but also how our attitude is changing…这并不容易，罗伯，这是 BBC 记者兼作家 Lucy Sigle 一直在谈论的事情。她在 BBC Radio 4 的 Costing the Earth 节目的讨论中发表了讲话，并解释了我们戒除塑料的问题，以及我们的态度是如何改变的…… Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and author(露西·西格尔，BBC记者兼作家)We have this weird psychological attachment to this material that’s been around and it’s like a push and pull. At the one time, we’re so horrified by what we’re seeing – the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic, beaming in from all over the world, and at the same time we’re being told we can’t live without it, so that creates a psychological dissonance –which I think is the barrier to behavioural change but I’m finding now awareness has peaked and it’s going over into activism.我们对这种一直存在的材料有一种奇怪的心理依恋，它就像一种推拉。曾经，我们对所看到的感到非常震惊 —— 鲸鱼死亡，海洋吐出塑料，从世界各地涌入，与此同时，我们被告知我们不能没有它，所以这造成了心理上的不和谐 —— 我认为这是行为改变的障碍，但我发现现在意识已经达到顶峰，并且正在转变为行动主义。 Rob(罗伯)She mentioned the word psychological – that’s something that affects or involves our mind – so here, psychological attachment means that in our mind we feel we have to use plastic – we’re addicted.她提到了心理这个词 – 这是影响或涉及我们思想的东西 – 所以在这里，心理依恋意味着在我们的思想中，我们觉得我们必须使用塑料 – 我们上瘾了。 Neil(尼尔)But we also see the negative impact of plastic – like whales dying – and in our mind we’re also thinking we must stop! This has created what Lucy says is a ‘psychological dissonance’ - dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas – so we’re having an argument in our head about the right thing to do – this is the ‘push and pull’ of thoughts she referred to.但我们也看到了塑料的负面影响 —— 就像鲸鱼死亡一样 —— 在我们心中，我们也在想我们必须停止！这造成了露西所说的“心理失调” —— 不调是指两个对立的想法之间的分歧 —— 所以我们在脑海中争论如何做 —— 这就是她提到的思想的“推拉”。 Rob(罗伯)And this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue – but now we’re starting to do something about it – we’re taking action to reduce our plastic waste – we’re turning to activism. That’s taking action to change something – it could be social or political change, or a change in our behaviour or attitude.这种不和谐一直是我们试图解决塑料问题的障碍 —— 但现在我们开始采取行动 —— 我们正在采取行动减少塑料垃圾 —— 我们正在转向行动主义。这就是采取行动来改变某事 —— 它可以是社会或政治变化，或者是我们行为或态度的改变。 Neil(尼尔)Of course there has been a big push – that means people have been strongly encouraged – to recycle.当然，已经有很大的推动力 —— 这意味着人们受到了强烈的鼓励 —— 回收利用。 Rob(罗伯)Maybe in an ideal world the best thing to do is go plastic-free – but that isn’t easy, is it?也许在理想情况下，最好的办法是无塑料 —— 但这并不容易，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)No, it isn’t, and it’s something Lucy Siegle spoke about. Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process. But where does she think we can make the biggest difference?不，不是，这是 Lucy Siegle 谈到的事情。在我们的生活中摆脱塑料是一个循序渐进的过程。但她认为我们可以在哪些方面做出最大的改变呢？ Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and author(露西·西格尔，BBC记者兼作家)I really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life is easier and more effective in the long term, than trying to go plastic-free from the outset. We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture.我真的认为，从长远来看，专注于阻止塑料流入您的生活比从一开始就尝试无塑料更容易、更有效。我们身处英国，拥有一种超市文化，因此许多减少塑料流动的技巧和窍门都在超市文化中得到传播。 Rob(罗伯)She says we have a supermarket culture in the UK. Culture here describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave – and in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets.她说我们在英国有一种超市文化。这里的文化描述了一种生活方式 —— 或者我们通常的行为方式 —— 就食品购买而言，我们倾向于在超市里这样做。 Neil(尼尔)So, for example, customers can make a big difference by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging. It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands – we need to be more careful about how and when we use it – and use our collective power to force change if it’s needed.因此，例如，客户可以通过向超市施加压力，要求他们减少使用塑料包装，从而产生很大的不同。塑料的未来似乎确实掌握在我们手中 —— 我们需要更加谨慎地使用塑料的方式和时间 —— 并在需要时利用我们的集体力量来推动变革。 Rob(罗伯)But there’s no doubt plastic is useful for many things so it will be a long time before it disappears altogether.但毫无疑问，塑料对很多东西都有用，所以它完全消失还需要很长时间。 Neil(尼尔)And earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic, invented over a 100 years ago. Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica?早些时候，我问你 100 多年前发明的第一种合成塑料叫什么名字。是不是……a） 电木；b） 有机玻璃还是 c） 富美家？ Rob(罗伯)And I said c) Formica. Was I right?我说 c） 富美家。我是对的吗？ Neil(尼尔)Formica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas in kitchens – but it’s not the oldest type. That was Bakelite.富美家是一种用于覆盖厨房桌子和工作区域的硬塑料 —— 但它并不是最古老的类型。那就是电木。 Rob(罗伯)I may have got that wrong but hopefully I’ll have more success recapping some of today’s vocabulary – starting with decay, which describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles – which plastic takes a long time to do.我可能弄错了，但希望我能更成功地重述今天的一些词汇 —— 从衰变开始，它描述了某物被破坏或分解成小颗粒的自然过程 —— 塑料需要很长时间才能完成。 Neil(尼尔)Next we had biodegradable – that’s a word to describe something that can decay naturally without harming anything.接下来是可生物降解的 —— 这个词用来描述可以自然腐烂而不会伤害任何东西的东西。 Rob(罗伯)Then we had psychological – that’s something that affects or involves your mind.然后我们有了心理 – 这是影响或涉及你的思想的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Next up, we had dissonance, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas.接下来，我们有 Dissonance，它描述了两个对立想法之间的分歧。 Rob(罗伯)And then we mentioned activism - that’s taking action to change something. We also mentioned the phrase a big push which means people are strongly encouraged or persuaded to do something, usefully by force.然后我们提到了行动主义 —— 即采取行动来改变某些事情。我们还提到了 a big push 这个词，意思是人们被强烈鼓励或说服去做某事，通过武力做某事。 Neil(尼尔)And finally we had culture. In our context of supermarket culture, it describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave.最后，我们有了文化。在我们超市文化的背景下，它描述了一种生活方式 —— 或者我们通常的行为方式。 Rob(罗伯)Thanks, Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, what generation are you? RobWell what are my choices? NeilYou can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born. RobOh, OK then, what are the different generations? NeilWell, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and … RobOK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties? NeilYou’re very smart. So, which one are you? RobAh, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil? NeilYes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media. RobOh, poor them! NeilMmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer? RobWell, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties. NeilWe’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different? Hiral PatelMost people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them. NeilSo Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations? RobYes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences. NeilAnd this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want. RobAnd she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers. NeilIt’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy. RobAnd being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge. NeilNow I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again: Hiral PatelMost people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them. NeilRight time to review this week’s vocabulary, but first let’s have an answer to that quiz. In what decade was the term ‘social media’ first coined? Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties What did you say Rob? RobYeah, well I said c) the noughties. NeilYou’re wrong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary. RobYes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years. NeilAnd we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009. RobThe next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market. NeilAnd if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable. RobThis makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy. NeilWell that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, what generation are you?罗伯，你是哪一代人？ Rob(罗伯)Well what are my choices?那么我有哪些选择呢？ Neil(尼尔)You can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born.你不能选择你是哪一代，这取决于你是什么时候出生的。 Rob(罗伯)Oh, OK then, what are the different generations?哦，好吧，有哪些不同的世代呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and …嗯，有婴儿潮一代，他们出生于 1940 年代到 1960 年代初之间。然后是 X 世代，出生于 1960 年代中期至 1980 年代初之间。然后是 Y 世代，也被称为千禧一代，出生于 1980 年代中期至 1990 年代后期，以及…… Rob(罗伯)OK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties?好吧，让我猜猜，Z 世代？出生于 90 年代末还是 90 年代初？ Neil(尼尔)You’re very smart. So, which one are you?你很聪明。那么，你是哪一个呢？ Rob(罗伯)Ah, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil?啊，那会暴露我的年龄，不是吗！好吧，我不得不承认我是 X 世代。那你呢，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media.是的，我也是，X 世代。但今天我们将关注 Z 世代，也称为 Z 世代。Z 世代的特别之处在于他们是社交媒体一代。他们从未经历过没有社交媒体的时代。 Rob(罗伯)Oh, poor them!哦，可怜的他们！ Neil(尼尔)Mmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer?嗯，嗯，这是一种观点。其他意见也可用。在我们更详细地研究 Z 世代之前，有一个问题。没有人能完全同意谁首先使用“社交媒体”这个词，但我们确实知道它来自哪个十年。是：a） 1980 年代；b） 1990 年代 c） 新世纪，即 21 世纪的第一个十年。罗伯，你的答案是什么？ Rob(罗伯)Well, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties.嗯，拜托，这是最近的事情。它必须是 c） 新世纪。 Neil(尼尔)We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different?我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，我们将听取巴克莱银行分析师 Hiral Patel 的发言。她出现在 BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目中，并被问及千禧一代和 Z 世代之间是否有太大差异。她认为它们是相同的还是不同的？ Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.大多数人将 Z 世代视为迷你千禧一代 —— 那是因为人们对“千禧一代”这个词很着迷。我们的研究表明，Z 世代是不同的，他们有自己的一套价值观和偏好，消费品牌需要迎合这些价值观和偏好。我们的研究发现，Z 世代是天生的技术型、消息灵通的消费者，而且非常精明。我们今天生活的这个高度互联的世界对他们来说是一种新常态。 Neil(尼尔)So Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations?那么 罗伯，Hiral Patel 认为这两代人之间有很大差异吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences.是的，她知道。但她评论说，并不是每个人都这样做。千禧一代是一个被频繁使用的术语，以至于许多人认为它指的是所有年轻人。她说，Z 世代不是迷你千禧一代，他们完全不同，有自己的价值观和偏好。 Neil(尼尔)And this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want.这对于消费品牌和想要向这一代销售产品的公司来说非常重要。他们需要迎合这一代人的需求，这意味着他们需要提供 Z 世代想要的商品。 Rob(罗伯)And she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers.她将 Z 世代描述为与生俱来的技术、消息灵通的消费者。 Neil(尼尔)It’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy.这有点拗口，但从本质上讲，这意味着他们对现代技术和社交媒体非常满意，因此有很多关于世界上正在发生的事情的信息。这使他们变得精明。 Rob(罗伯)And being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge.精明意味着能够很好地理解情况并因为这些知识而做出明智的决定。 Neil(尼尔)Now I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again:现在我认为我对现代互联技术和媒体非常了解，但我不是伴随着它长大的，它是新的。对于 Z 世代来说，这种技术水平是正常的，正如 Hiral Patel 所说，它无处不在，而且一直都是，这是他们的常态。她又来了： Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for.

In what decade was the term ‘social media’ first coined? Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties What did you say Rob?是时候复习本周的词汇了，但首先让我们来回答一下这个测验。“社交媒体”一词最早是在哪个十年创造的？是：a） 1980 年代；b） 1990 年代 c） 新世纪 你说 罗伯 什么？ Rob(罗伯)Yeah, well I said c) the noughties.是的，我说的是 c） 新世纪。 Neil(尼尔)You’re wrong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary.你错了。也许不足为奇，1990 年代就是答案。我相信你们中的大多数人都猜对了。好了，现在，词汇。 Rob(罗伯)Yes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years.是的，本周我们一直在谈论几代人。这是一个术语，用于描述在特定时期出生的人，通常但并不总是大约 18 到 20 年。 Neil(尼尔)And we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009.我们专注于 Z 世代或 Z 世代，包括出生在二十世纪初的人，即 21 世纪的第一个十年，从 2000 年到 2009 年。 Rob(罗伯)The next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market.下一个表达是迎合。这意味着提供特定群体需要或想要的东西。如果你想卖东西，你需要迎合你的目标市场。 Neil(尼尔)And if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable.如果你的市场是 Z 世代，你需要意识到他们是技术天生的，消息灵通。他们在互联技术中长大，知识渊博。 Rob(罗伯)This makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy.这使他们非常精明。这个形容词的意思是聪明和聪明。在这种情况下，这意味着他们能够对购买什么做出明智的决定，因为他们连接了如此多的信息来源。对于 Z 世代来说，这种水平的互动和连接是常态。这是正常的，对他们来说是正常的。因此，我有时会与现代生活和技术作斗争 —— 对于 Z 世代来说，这很容易。 Neil(尼尔)Well that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling. RobNeil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off. NeilAnd a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion. RobWell, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about? NeilOK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s? RobI do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s. NeilWell, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket. RobYes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion. NeilHannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason? Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The GuardianThere’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion. RobSo her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed. NeilAnd these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that! RobHannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction. NeilTraction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front. RobThis raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing? NeilYes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue? Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The GuardianEvery time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there. NeilSo she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work. RobAnd the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily. NeilAnd we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s? RobYes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right! NeilWell, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear. RobOK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil. NeilThey, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed. RobNext we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive. NeilAnd then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss. RobWell, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever. NeilThat’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English. See you soon. Goodbye. RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling.罗伯，很高兴看到你穿着高可见度夹克跟上时尚 —— 尽管我不得不说它有点令人眼花缭乱。 Rob(罗伯)Neil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off.Neil，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 这件高可见度或高能见度夹克是为了安全。我在伦敦骑自行车时戴着它，只是忘了摘下它。 Neil(尼尔)And a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion.顺便说一句，时尚受害者是那些总是穿着被认为是时尚的东西的人，即使它实际上在他们身上看起来并不好。但穿着高可见度的衣服已经成为最新的时尚宣言 —— 这是你穿来吸引注意力和对时尚有所了解的人的东西。 Rob(罗伯)Well, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about?好吧，我可以向你保证，我穿上鲜艳的夹克并不是为了看起来很酷，但在今天的节目中，我们将讨论为什么有些人会这样做。但首先，Neil，您有没有一个问题要我们考虑？ Neil(尼尔)OK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s?好吧，我们知道时尚来来去去，但是在哪个十年里，暖腿套作为流行的时尚配饰佩戴？是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？ Rob(罗伯)I do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s.我确实记得这些，所以我会说 b） 1980 年代。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket.好吧，我们将在节目结束时揭晓答案。现在让我们更多地谈谈今年 T 台上最奇怪的服装 —— 不起眼的高可见度夹克。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion.是的，为了安全起见，它们被设计为供骑自行车的人和行人以及需要在道路上工作或指挥交通的工人佩戴。所以，现在人们选择穿着它们来紧跟潮流，这很奇怪 —— 这是在追随最新的时尚。 Neil(尼尔)Hannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason?Hannah Marriott 是《卫报》的时尚编辑。她告诉 BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours，为什么她认为人们会转向明亮、发光的衣服。原因是什么？ Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)There’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion.目前还有一种趋势是，人们穿着非常明亮、非常引人注目的衣服，感觉有了社交媒体，你知道的，每个人都以如此快的速度向下滚动他们的 Instagram 屏幕，任何吸引眼球的东西，这似乎是的，就像一个话题，一些会得到一些关注的东西 —— 这些趋势目前越来越受欢迎 —— 而不是那种低调的羊绒毛衣那种时尚。 Rob(罗伯)So her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed.所以她的理由是社交媒体。在我们快节奏的生活中，我们快速浏览社交媒体信息，人们希望脱颖而出，吸引我们的注意力并引起注意。 Neil(尼尔)And these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that!这些寻求关注的人需要穿一些引人注目的衣服 —— 一些会吸引你眼球并被注意到的东西。High-vis 服装当然可以做到这一点！ Rob(罗伯)Hannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction.Hannah 提到，穿着不同的衣服会成为一个话题 —— 你或我可能会在工作中或社交媒体上讨论的东西 —— 即使是说“那些家伙看起来很荒谬”！她还提到，人们对这类趋势越来越感兴趣并接受 —— 她使用的词是牵引力。 Neil(尼尔)Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front.这里的牵引力意味着这种时尚趋势开始流行起来。当然，时尚是有代价的。虽然用于工作服的普通高可见度背心通常价格实惠，但当它们作为时尚单品出售时，它们的价格可能会高得多，特别是如果它们的正面有设计师品牌。 Rob(罗伯)This raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing?这就提出了一个重要的问题。我们知道，许多穿着高可见度夹克的人都在做重要的工作，那么这种时尚是否贬低了他们正在做的事情的价值呢？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue?是的，这是 Hannah Marriott 谈到的事情。让我们再次听到她的心声。她用什么词来形容一个难题？ Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)Every time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there.每次时尚借鉴工作服时，总会有一些棘手的问题 —— 尤其是当你收取 2000 英镑的价格买一件实际上非常相似的东西时，你知道，某人可能穿着的制服实际上赚不到那么多钱，你知道，那里显然存在一些棘手的阶级问题。 Neil(尼尔)So she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work.所以她用 thorny 这个词来描述工作时穿的东西变成昂贵的时尚单品的问题。棘手的问题是难以处理的话题。在这里，她特别提到了阶级问题 —— 因此社会上处于不同经济地位的不同群体 —— 有些人买得起时尚服装，有些人只能买得起工作用的衣服。 Rob(罗伯)And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily.另一个问题是，如果每个人都开始穿着高可见度的衣服，那么需要为了自身安全而脱颖而出的人可能不会那么容易脱颖而出。 Neil(尼尔)And we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s?当您骑自行车外出时，我们不想错过您，罗伯。但是，如果您穿着一双护腿套，我们会想念您吗？早些时候，我问护腿套是哪十年的流行时尚配饰。是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right!是的，我说的是 b） 1980 年代。它必须是正确的！ Neil(尼尔)Well, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear.嗯，你知道你的时尚，罗伯 - 那确实是 1980 年代。暖腿套最初是舞者穿着的，以防止她们的肌肉在伸展后抽筋，但在 1980 年代初期，它们成为十几岁女孩穿的时尚。 Rob(罗伯)OK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil.好，让我们继续回顾我们今天提到的一些词汇。从时尚受害者开始 —— 那是总是穿着被认为是时尚的衣服的人，即使它实际上穿在他们身上并不好看。就像你以前穿的那条红色牛仔裤一样，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)They, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed.他们，罗伯，紧跟潮流 —— 这意味着“跟上最新的时尚”。当然，穿红色衣服非常引人注目，这意味着吸引注意力并被注意到。 Rob(罗伯)Next we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive.接下来我们提到了牵引力。如果某件事获得牵引力，它就会被接受和流行。然后我们就低估了。在时尚界，这描述了不引起注意且不那么令人印象深刻的事物。 Neil(尼尔)And then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss.然后我们讨论了 thorny 这个词。长有荆棘的树木或灌木丛很难触摸和处理，同样，棘手的问题也是一个难以处理和讨论的话题。 Rob(罗伯)Well, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever.好吧，我们今天已经讨论了一些棘手和不那么棘手的问题，但我们知道时尚会发生变化，也许高可见度的时尚不会永远存在。 Neil(尼尔)That’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English. See you soon. Goodbye.现在就到这里了，但请下次加入我们的六分钟英语。一会见。再见。 Rob(罗伯)Bye bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】fashion victimsomeone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them时尚牺牲品总是穿着被认为时尚的东西的人，即使它实际上并不适合他们She’s a real fashion victim, always chasing the latest trends regardless of whether they suit her.她是个不折不扣的时尚牺牲品，总是追逐最新的潮流，不管是否适合她。 on-trendin keeping up with the latest fashion当季流行的紧跟最新时尚Her on-trend outfit showcased the season’s hottest colours and silhouettes.她那身当季流行的服装展现了本季最热门的颜色和轮廓。 eye-catchingattracting attention and being noticed引人注目的吸引注意力并被注意到The eye-catching display in the shop window drew many passersby to a halt.商店橱窗里引人注目的展示吸引了许多路人驻足观看。 tractionif something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular获得关注如果某事获得关注，它就会被接受和流行起来The new policy is slowly gaining traction among the public.这项新政策正在逐渐获得公众的关注。 understated(fashion) something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive低调的（时尚）不会引起注意，也不那么令人印象深刻Her understated elegance was far more appealing than flamboyant displays of wealth.她低调的优雅远比炫耀财富更吸引人。 thornya thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss棘手的棘手的问题是一个难以处理和讨论的话题The issue of climate change is a thorny one, demanding international cooperation.气候变化问题是一个棘手的问题，需要国际合作。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["学习笔记"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】网络流行语雪花是什么意思？？","path":"/2018/09/20/wechat-2018-09-20/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilHello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, would you say that were a snowflake? RobWow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude? NeilSo I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked. RobDon’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say. NeilThere is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there? RobYes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults. NeilWell we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016. RobWell, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob? RobThanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be. NeilAlso, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do. RobThese terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics. NeilThe topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence? Evan DavisFirst, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination. NeilHe says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence. RobIf you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive. NeilDavis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again. Evan DavisWhere the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong. RobHis point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things. NeilAnd I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes. RobWell I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil? NeilOf course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016. RobAnd I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right! NeilWell, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence. RobPeople can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group. NeilThe term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings. RobTo call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification. NeilAnd finally we have taboo. Something that society says is offensive and shocking. So there we have it. What do you think Rob of this topic. RobWell it is a very difficult subject, particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society. Free speech is good but at times, particularly on social media, I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant. NeilWell, try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme. Do join us next time. Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. And of course, we have a new app which you can find on our website. It’s free and it’s brilliant isn’t it Rob? RobAbsolutely! NeilSee you soon, bye. RobBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, would you say that were a snowflake?罗伯，你会说那是一片雪花吗？ Rob(罗伯)Wow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude?哇，我真不敢相信你这么说，这太冒犯了。你怎么能这么粗鲁呢？ Neil(尼尔)So I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked.所以我想这是肯定的吗？对不起，我只是问了。 Rob(罗伯)Don’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say.别担心，我并不是真的不高兴，我只是想演示这个词的含义。近年来，雪花这个词有了新的含义。如今，它被用作侮辱。它被用来批评那些被认为很容易被别人所说的话冒犯或不安的人或团体。 Neil(尼尔)There is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there?它通常也有政治的一面，不是吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults.是的，使用雪花这个词的人往往来自政治右翼，他们通常用它来指代政治左翼人士，尤其是千禧一代 —— 年轻的、有社会意识的成年人。 Neil(尼尔)Well we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.好吧，我们稍后将更详细地探讨这个主题，但首先是一个测验问题。snowflake 是哪一年的 Collins Dictionary 年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。 Rob(罗伯)Well, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016.嗯，我们说这是一个很新的词，所以我选择 c） 2016。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob?好吧，我们稍后会发现您在该计划中是否正确。冒犯的话题是一个非常复杂的话题。首先，我们所说的冒犯 罗伯 是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Thanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be.谢谢你。这是一个非常困难的问题。冒犯性的东西是粗鲁的、侮辱性的，会让人感到受伤和不安。然而，困难的是，我们并不都觉得同样的事情令人反感。有些人可能会故意冒犯，有些人可能会无意冒犯。 Neil(尼尔)Also, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do.此外，不同的人对冒犯的反应也不同 —— 有些人认为这是言论自由的代价，有些人试图阻止他们认为冒犯的人说出他们所做的事情。 Rob(罗伯)These terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics.这些术语在关于平等、种族、宗教，当然还有政治的讨论中经常出现。 Neil(尼尔)The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence?BBC 广播节目 Sweet Reason 详细讨论了这个话题。Evan Davis 介绍了该计划，以下是他对讨论的总结的第一部分。他说有些人谈论冒犯的原因是什么？ Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)First, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination.首先，有时人们可能确实会援引冒犯，而实际上他们只是存在政治分歧，有时遭受歧视或排斥的群体可能会觉得大声疾呼这种歧视令人振奋或团结起来。 Neil(尼尔)He says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence.他说，当这只是政治分歧时，有些人会感到冒犯。他说他们引发了冒犯。 Rob(罗伯)If you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive.如果你引用了某项内容，则意味着你用它来支持你的观点或解释你的操作。因此，援引冒犯就是说我们之所以这样做，是因为我们对你所说的话感到冒犯，尽管冒犯可能只是政治上的分歧，而不是真正冒犯性的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again.戴维斯继续说，确实遭受歧视的群体在大声疾呼歧视时可能会获得一些团结的感觉。当他们宣传和强调他们所经历的歧视时，他们会感觉更加团结。即使受到的一些冒犯可能不是真实的，但这并不意味着人们没有权利被冒犯。埃文·戴维斯 又来了。 Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong.所谓的雪花肯定有道理，社会有权将某些事情定为禁忌，而千禧一代使用冒犯性这个词只是为了说一些观点不仅是错误的，而且属于一类特殊的错误。 Rob(罗伯)His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things.他在这里的观点是，社会可以决定某些事情是禁忌。在这种情况下，禁忌的东西就是被社会视为令人震惊和冒犯的东西，人们被这些事情冒犯是可以的。 Neil(尼尔)And I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes.我认为他提出的观点很好。雪花这个词通常被用作侮辱 —— 但有些人可能会为自己是雪花而感到自豪，因为这意味着他们正在捍卫特定的标准，他们的体面和社会责任水平高于那些称他们为雪花的人。 Rob(罗伯)Well I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil?好吧，我希望我们今天没有引起任何冒犯。在我们回顾词汇之前，我们能回答今天的问题吗 尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Of course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.当然，我问雪花是哪一年的柯林斯词典年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。 Rob(罗伯)And I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right!我说 c） 2016 年。它必须是正确的！ Neil(尼尔)Well, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence.那么，你想听这个故事吗？有趣的是，这个词是在 1996 年的《搏击俱乐部》一书中创造的，但直到 2016 年，它才成为词典的年度词汇之一。现在让我们回顾一下我们今天的词汇。首先是冒犯。 Rob(罗伯)People can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.人们可能会因为冒犯性的事情而受到冒犯和冒犯。冒犯性的内容可能是粗鲁的、侮辱性的和令人震惊的。它可能表现为对个人或群体的羞辱或歧视。 Neil(尼尔)The term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings.雪花一词是一些人用来谈论他们认为太容易和不必要地被冒犯的其他人的词。他们不想仅仅因为雪花不安就改变他们的语言或想法。然后我们有了 invoke 这个词。如果你援引某样东西，你就把它作为解释你的行为和感受的理由。 Rob(罗伯)To call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification.指出某件事就是挑战它，突出它并寻找理由。 Neil(尼尔)And finally we have taboo.

And welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. DanIn today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app? RobNo way, I would never use one. DanHmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right? RobAh, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left. DanWe will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think? RobWell, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is? Alice GrayIt’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person. RobSo she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not. DanAlthough of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them. RobYes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you. DanSo what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again. Alice GrayWe see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another. RobSo, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times. DanIn real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on. RobIn the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with. DanWell, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five. RobHmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right? DanSorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you? RobYes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high. DanIt’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary. RobOK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like. DanOur decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once. RobRejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them. DanIf you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection. RobYeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off. But, having many rejections can be difficult to cope with, which means it can be difficult to manage, difficult to keep positive. DanWell, we hope you don’t swipe left on this programme and you will join us again next time Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. RobAnd don’t forget our new BBC Learning English app. DanOh good idea. See you soon. Bye. RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello. And welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan.你好。欢迎来到六分钟英语。我是 Dan。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Dan(担)In today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app?在今天的节目中，我们将看看当我们使用约会应用节目时，我们的大脑在做什么。现在，罗伯，你用过约会应用吗？ Rob(罗伯)No way, I would never use one.不可能，我永远不会用。 Dan(担)Hmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right?嗯，那么 罗伯，您能否解释一下，在谈论约会应用程序时，我们所说的向左滑动和向右滑动是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Ah, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left.啊，是的。这些不是新词，但技术赋予了它们新的含义。滑动是您在智能手机上的手指移动以更改您正在查看的屏幕。所以想象一下，在书中翻页，嗯，在手机上，你滑动。在一些约会应用程序中，他们会向您展示您可能会觉得有吸引力的人的照片。如果你喜欢他们，你可以向右滑动。如果你不喜欢他们，你可以向左滑动。 Dan(担)We will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think?我们稍后将深入探讨这个话题，但首先是一个问题。在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一 你怎么看？ Rob(罗伯)Well, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four.嗯，所有这些在我看来都相当高，所以我猜一下，四分之一。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is?好吧，我们将在该计划的后面发现您是否正确。现在，Alice Gray 是一名科学传播者和博主。最近，她做客了 BBC Radio 4 的 Woman’s Hour 节目，她被问及当我们使用约会应用节目时，与在现实生活中认识人时相比，我们的大脑中发生了什么。她说有什么区别呢？ Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)It’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person.我们很容易认为，通过这些瞬间向左滑动、向右滑动，我们大脑中如何挑选合适伴侣的过程会非常不同，而实际上这与我们亲自做事的方式非常相似。 Rob(罗伯)So she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not.所以她说，我们大脑中发生的事情实际上非常相似。在网上，我们很快就决定了我们喜欢谁。这些决定几乎是立竿见影的 —— 她为此使用了形容词 instantaneous。因此，我们立即做出这些决定，然后选择向左滑动或向右滑动。在现实生活中，我们做同样的事情。当我们看到某人时，我们几乎立即知道我们是否觉得他们有吸引力。 Dan(担)Although of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them.当然，在数字约会中，您向左滑动的约会将永远不会再看到那个人，您也没有机会见面。在现实世界中，您可能会立即遇到一个您认为没有吸引力的人，然后了解他们并发现您确实非常喜欢他们。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you.是的，这是真的，但那样的话，他们可能不会喜欢你。然后你必须面对拒绝。拒绝是指有人觉得你没有吸引力，他们不想花时间和你在一起或了解你。 Dan(担)So what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again.那么，在我们的大脑中，在线拒绝和现实生活中的拒绝有什么区别呢？又是 Alice Gray。 Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)We see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another.我们看到，与现实生活中的拒绝和约会应用程序上的拒绝相关的许多模式是相似的，只是你在约会应用程序上被拒绝的比率比现实生活中的要高得多。所以在现实生活中，你会有时间，在某种程度上，计算一下被拒绝的情况，稍微克服它，然后掸掉身上的灰尘，继续前进。虽然约会应用程序的拒绝率如此之高，但通常很难应对一个接一个的进来。 Rob(罗伯)So, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times.所以，她说我们的大脑对现实生活和在线拒绝的反应非常相似，但在数字世界中，你可能会被拒绝很多次。 Dan(担)In real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on.正如她所说，在现实生活中，你有更多的时间从拒绝中恢复过来，克服它。你可以把自己掸掉，这是一种说你积极思考让自己感觉更好的方式 —— 想象一下摔倒在地上，当你站起来时，你可能会沾满灰尘和污垢，你需要把自己掸掉灰尘，让自己再次做好准备，然后再继续。 Rob(罗伯)In the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with.然而，在网络世界中，你没有那个时间。在线约会应用程序可能会导致许多拒绝，并且在心理上可能难以管理。“难以管理”的另一种说法是难以应对。 Dan(担)Well, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five.好吧，我们不希望您拒绝我们，所以现在是时候在回顾今天的词汇之前为您提供该测验问题的答案了。我问：在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一。 Rob(罗伯)Hmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right?嗯，所以我说 b） 四分之一 – 25%。我是对的吗？ Dan(担)Sorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you?对不起，罗伯，答案是 a），三分之一。这让你感到惊讶吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high.是的，确实如此，我没想到会那么高。 Dan(担)It’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary.这是时代的标志，罗伯。数字世界 – 数字约会！让我们来看看这个词汇。 Rob(罗伯)OK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like.好了，我们从动词 to swipe 开始。我们的手指在智能手机或平板电脑屏幕上的移动，以表明我们是否喜欢某人。向右滑动表示喜欢，不喜欢则向左滑动。 Dan(担)Our decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once.我们决定是否发现某人有吸引力通常是即时的。这个形容词的意思是立即的。 Rob(罗伯)Rejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them.拒绝是指你让某人知道你对他们不感兴趣，你不想和他们发生浪漫关系。 Dan(担)If you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection.如果你被拒绝了，你可能需要一些时间来感觉好些，为此你可以使用短语动词 get over。克服拒绝可能需要一些时间。 Rob(罗伯)Yeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off. But, having many rejections can be difficult to cope with, which means it can be difficult to manage, difficult to keep positive.是的，我明白！被拒绝后保持积极乐观可以被描述为掸掉自己的灰尘。但是，有很多拒绝可能很难应对，这意味着很难管理，很难保持积极。 Dan(担)Well, we hope you don’t swipe left on this programme and you will join us again next time Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.好吧，我们希望您不要在这个节目上向左滑动，下次您会再次加入我们请记住，您可以在 Instagram、Facebook、Twitter、YouTube 上找到我们，当然还有我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com。 Rob(罗伯)And don’t forget our new BBC Learning English app.别忘了我们新的 BBC Learning English 应用程序。 Dan(担)Oh good idea.

I’m Catherine. DanAnd I’m Dan. CatherineNow Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all? DanIf I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that’s not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I’ll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life. CatherineNice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think? DanBased on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself. CatherineWe’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest. DanDeath by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years. CatherineHow has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems? John LaurensonIf you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close. CatherineHow did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan? DanWell, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’. Catherine‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said? DanHe talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk. CatherineLaurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard. DanStern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around. CatherineSo we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life. DanBut he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise. CatherineWell, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? DanAnd I said I had no idea. CatherineWell, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours. DanI guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain. CatherineAnd sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise. DanAnd if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live. CatherineNext we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise. DanSomething that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously. CatherineIf you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict. DanAnd finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around. CatherineWell, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise.

So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.如果我只去工作，是的，我会过上久坐不动的生活。我坐在管子上，一天中的大部分时间都坐在我的办公桌前或工作室里。但因为我知道这对我的健康不利，所以我也喜欢每周去几次健身房，我会做一些运动，比如骑自行车或在周末踢足球。所以，我的工作是久坐不动的，但不是我的生活。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question.

So, Dan, what do you think?“回答得不错，丹。我们今天的主题是关于一个国家如何在处理久坐不动的人口问题方面非常成功。但在我们了解更多信息之前，这里有一个今天的问题。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？那么，Dan，你怎么看？ Dan(担)Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself.根据我的一天，这将在 8 到 9 小时之间，但我不知道我是否是一个普通人！所以我很想自己了解答案。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest.我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，40 年前，芬兰可能是西方世界最不健康的国家。但现在，它是最健康的疫苗之一。 Dan(担)Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.芬兰的心脏病死亡率下降了 80%，预期寿命延长了 10 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)How has this been achieved?

BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?这是如何实现的？BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目对此进行了调查，芬兰改善国家健康的方式之一是通过大量的国家参与。BBC 记者约翰·劳伦森 以幽默的方式描述了这是如何运作的。他如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人？ John Laurenson(约翰·劳伦森)If you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.如果你因为肥胖、年老、哮喘、被锁在电脑前、或者只是懒惰或所有这些事情都归入一个超级健康重灾区而成为运动推卸者，他们可能会以一位拿着写字板的严厉女士的形式来找你，并提出一些坚定的建议。他们实际上不会把你从 PlayStation 上拖下来，拖出你的疗养院或酒吧，但他们确实非常接近。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?丹，他是如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人的？ Dan(担)Well, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’.嗯，他不是很恭维，我们应该强调，这份报告相当半开玩笑，这意味着它本来就是为了搞笑，不应该被认真对待，但他称有很多健康问题的人为“超级健康灾难区”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?“超级健康灾区”。那么，我们还可以从他所说的内容中挑选出哪些其他词汇呢？ Dan(担)He talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk.他谈到自己是一个运动推销者。推卸责任的人通常是因为他们懒惰而避免做某事。它也是一个动词，即 shrk。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Laurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard.劳伦森说，如果你是一个运动推销者，或者确实是一个超级健康重灾区，当局会有人来拜访你。在另一个半开玩笑的描述中，他说这位访客可能是一位拿着写字板的严厉女士。 Dan(担)Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.Stern 是一个形容词，意思是非常严肃和严格，一个没有幽默感的人可能会很生气。在他的描述中，记者说这位严厉的女士将有一个剪贴板。这是一块硬板，您可以在上面贴上纸张，这样您就可以在四处走动时在纸上写字。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life.所以我们有一张生气的女士来到你家的照片，告诉你的健康习惯，让你过上更健康的生活。 Dan(担)But he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.但他确实指出，他们实际上不会把你拖出家门去锻炼。然而，在报告中，他继续说，即使从学生时代开始，也有很多鼓励要吃得好并定期锻炼。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours?好吧，在一位拿着写字板的严厉女士来告诉我们没有按时完成之前，让我们来了解今天测验的答案。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？ Dan(担)And I said I had no idea.我说我不知道。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours.嗯，答案是 c）， Dan - 8 到 9 小时之间。事实上，那是 8 个半小时。相比之下，芬兰的车程不到 6 小时。 Dan(担)I guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain.我想我们在英国久坐不动的情况要多得多。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.久坐是我们词汇复习中的第一个词。这是一个形容词，用于描述一种涉及大量坐着而不进行太多运动的生活方式。 Dan(担)And if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live.如果你久坐不动，可能会导致预期寿命降低。预期寿命，您预计的寿命。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Next we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise.接下来，我们有 shirker 这个词，指的是那些避免做他们不喜欢的事情的人，通常是因为他们很懒惰。例如，运动的 shirker 避免运动。 Dan(担)Something that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.半开玩笑地说的话是为了幽默而不是被认真对待。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)If you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict.不过，如果你很严厉，你就会希望被认真对待。这是一个形容词，意思是严肃和严格。 Dan(担)And finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.最后是剪贴板。一块你把文件贴在上面的板子，这样你就可以在走动时在上面写字。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilNow Rob, you like your food, don’t you? RobOh yes, yum yum, food! One of my favourite things. NeilAnd what do you think of street food? RobI love street food. There are some great places in London where you can find delicious foods from all over the world, cooked in front of you in market stalls on the street. NeilIt’s quite new though, isn’t it - not really a British tradition. RobI guess not, but it seems to be much more popular these days. NeilWell our topic today is street food, but before we tuck into that, here is today’s question. Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old? What do you think? RobI don’t know - but what I do know is, I wouldn’t really want to try a sandwich made from that bread! NeilMmm, it might be a bit mouldy. RobYes! Anyway, I’m going to have a guess and say c) 5,500 years old. NeilRight, we will find out the answer later in the programme. Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas? Mark LaurieIt’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like. NeilSo where does he say the popularity of street food is growing? RobHe says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities. NeilSo essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere. RobExactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big. NeilYes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular. RobYou know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience. NeilWell, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK. Mark LaurieIt’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like. NeilMark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular. What kind of food does he say it’s not like? Mark LaurieYeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub. NeilSo street food is many things, but what isn’t it? RobWell he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven. NeilYou know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave. RobBut I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic. NeilYes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture. RobHe also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’. NeilWell, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years? RobMmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years. NeilAnd I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years. RobVery tasty I’m sure. NeilYes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary. RobThen we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular. NeilAnd not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities. RobSomething which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time. NeilAnd one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy. RobAnd finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven. And that kind of food is not seen by some as authentic. NeilWell, it’s time to eat, so that’s all we have time for today. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye. RobBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello.

Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old? What do you think?我们今天的主题是街头小吃，但在我们深入讨论之前，这里是今天的问题。最近，约旦的考古学家发现了他们认为是最古老的面包遗骸。这面包有多少年了？是吗。。。a） 18,000 年；b） 14,000 年，还是 c） 5,500 年？你觉得怎么样？ Rob(罗伯)I don’t know - but what I do know is, I wouldn’t really want to try a sandwich made from that bread!我不知道 - 但我所知道的是，我真的不想尝试用这种面包做的三明治！ Neil(尼尔)Mmm, it might be a bit mouldy.嗯，它可能有点发霉。 Rob(罗伯)Yes! Anyway, I’m going to have a guess and say c) 5,500 years old.是的！无论如何，我要猜一下，然后说 c） 5,500 岁。 Neil(尼尔)Right, we will find out the answer later in the programme. Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas?好的，我们将在稍后的节目中找到答案。Mark Laurie 来自全国餐饮业协会。他是英国街头食品业务的专家。他出现在 BBC 电台的 The Food Programme 上，并被问及近年来街头食品业务发生了怎样的变化。在他的回答中，他谈到了街头食品增长最快的地区。这些区域是什么？ Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.街头食品的增长非常惊人，它真的起飞了，它真的成为了相当主流。这个国家文化结构的一部分，真的，或者说它开始成为，肯定是在大城市，而且如果你愿意的话，越来越多地出现在那种省份。 Neil(尼尔)So where does he say the popularity of street food is growing?那么，他认为街头食品的受欢迎程度在哪里增长呢？ Rob(罗伯)He says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities.他说，在大城市和外省都有。省是一个词，意思是城市以外的国家部分。 Neil(尼尔)So essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere.所以从本质上讲，他是在说它在任何地方都越来越受欢迎。 Rob(罗伯)Exactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big.完全。事实上，他说增长是惊人的。这意味着他认为增长非常壮观，非常大。 Neil(尼尔)Yes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular.是的，他说它真的起飞了。Taken off 是可以以多种不同方式使用的短语动词之一。从这个意义上说，当某件事起飞时，意味着它变得成功和受欢迎。 Rob(罗伯)You know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience.你知道，街头小吃并不是你真正与英国联系在一起的东西。也许是气候或英国食物 - 所以街头小吃是我们现在已经习惯并更加享受的东西。事实上，Mark 说它现在正在成为主流。这意味着它不再被视为不寻常或不同的东西。它正在成为日常饮食体验中被接受的一部分。 Neil(尼尔)Well, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK.好吧，让我们再听听 Mark Laurie 谈论英国街头食品的增长。 Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.街头食品的增长非常惊人，它真的起飞了，它真的成为了相当主流。这个国家文化结构的一部分，真的，或者说它开始成为，肯定是在大城市，而且如果你愿意的话，越来越多地出现在那种省份。 Neil(尼尔)Mark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular. What kind of food does he say it’s not like?Mark Laurie 继续谈论街头食品变得流行的原因。他说这不像什么样的食物？ Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)Yeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub.是的，它真的抓住了公众的想象力。这是诚实的食物，是正宗的食物，而且是您可以信任的人制作。它不是一些微波炉食物或任何你在当地酒吧可能买到的东西。 Neil(尼尔)So street food is many things, but what isn’t it?所以街头小吃有很多东西，但什么不是呢？ Rob(罗伯)Well he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven.嗯，他说这不像你在一些酒吧里买到的食物。他说，那种食物可能是一些微波炉食物。这是在微波炉中准备的食物。 Neil(尼尔)You know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave.你知道我很喜欢时不时地用微波炉加热我的剩菜。 Rob(罗伯)But I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic.但我想，如果你花钱吃一顿美餐，你就不会指望重新加热的剩菜了！我认为他想说的是，在许多地方，你吃到的食物不是新鲜制作的。它可以预先准备好并在微波炉中完成。他说，街头小吃是正宗的。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture.是的，正宗的。它是真实的、新鲜的，就在你面前烹制的，如果它是来自特定国家的食物，它可能是由来自该文化的人准备的。 Rob(罗伯)He also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’.他还表示，这激发了公众的想象力。这是公众经历过并认为的事情 - ‘是的，你知道，我喜欢这个，这是一个好主意。 Neil(尼尔)Well, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years?好吧，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我感到饥饿，所以让我们得到测验的答案，并在我们出发吃点东西之前复习今天的词汇。我们询问了约旦考古学家发现的面包的年代。是 a） 18,000 年，b） 14,000 年还是 c） 5,500 年？ Rob(罗伯)Mmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years.嗯，我说是 c） 5,500 年。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years.而且我担心它比这要霉得多。答案是 14,000 年。 Rob(罗伯)Very tasty I’m sure.我敢肯定，非常好吃。 Neil(尼尔)Yes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary.是的！就在那时，词汇。我们从形容词 phenomenal 开始来描述令人惊叹、非凡和非凡的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Then we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular.然后我们不得不起飞，一个短语动词，意思是变得流行。街头小吃在英国真正起飞：它变得非常受欢迎。 Neil(尼尔)And not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities.不仅在城市，而且在省份，这是一个名词，用来描述一个国家不是主要城市的地区。 Rob(罗伯)Something which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time.吸引想象力的东西是让你感兴趣的东西，而不仅仅是短暂的。 Neil(尼尔)And one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy.吸引英国公众想象力的一件事是正宗的街头食品。真实的东西就是真的，它是真实的，不是假的或复制的。 Rob(罗伯)And finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Hello! NeilNow, Catherine, say cheese. CatherineCheeeese. NeilThank you, a little souvenir of our time together. CatherineLet’s have a look… Hang on a minute. You just took a selfie, I wasn’t even in the picture. NeilAh, well, that’s the magic of the smartphone, two cameras! You know, that’s not something you can do with a traditional camera. I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days? CatherineI do actually. It’s in a cupboard somewhere at home. NeilWell, that is the topic of this programme. Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones, or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone? CatherineInteresting question. But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners? NeilOf course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think? CatherineWell, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself. NeilOK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens. CatherineThat’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control. NeilAnd there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs. CatherineAnd of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated. NeilPhil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion? Phil HallI don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely. NeilSo does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera? CatherineIn a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales. NeilThis is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else. CatherineFor people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone. NeilSo camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again. Phil HallI think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit. NeilWho does he say might be buying cameras? CatherineHe says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones. NeilGetting into something means becoming very interested in it. CatherineAnd if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it. NeilSo people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’. CatherineNow, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level. NeilNow, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again. CatherineFirst we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice. NeilWhen the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time. CatherineTo opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it. NeilIf you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated. CatherineAnd developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up. NeilRight, that’s all from us from us in this programme. Do join us again next time and don’t forget that in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye.

But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners?有趣的问题。但在我们进入这个话题之前，我们先向听众提出一个问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)Of course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think?答案是肯定的。我们当然处于摄影的数字时代，但第一款数码照相手机是什么时候发布的呢？是：a） 2000 年；b） 2004 年还是 c） 2007 年？你觉得怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself.嗯，我其实知道这个，所以我要公平地说，把它留给自己。 Neil(尼尔)OK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens.好，好吧，请听节目结束时的答案。今天有不同种类的相机可用。有紧凑型相机，它们很小，大部分是自动的，通常带有固定镜头。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control.没错。然后是更大的 SLR 和 DSLR，您可以更换这些相机的镜头，它们允许进行大量手动控制。 Neil(尼尔)And there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs.还有无反光镜相机，它是紧凑型相机和数码单反相机的交叉。它们像紧凑型相机一样小，但您也可以在它们上使用与数码单反相机相同的镜头。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated.当然，智能手机上也有摄像头，这些摄像头很方便，而且它们变得越来越复杂。 Neil(尼尔)Phil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion?Phil Hall 是 Tech Radar 杂志的编辑。在 BBC 节目 You and Yours 中，有人问他是否认为智能手机会让其他相机过时。他怎么看呢？ Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)I don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely.我不这么认为。我认为，虽然紧凑型相机的销量确实有所下降，但人们选择了智能手机，而低端、廉价的紧凑型相机则选择了智能手机，我认为制造商正在关注更高端的高端相机、高端紧凑型相机、数码单反相机，这些相机是可以安装镜头的相机，无反光镜相机。所以，市场正在发生变化。而且我认为不会很快出现……智能手机将完全接管相机。 Neil(尼尔)So does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera?那么 Phil 认为智能手机会杀死相机吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)In a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales.一句话，没有。他确实说过，廉价紧凑型相机的销量已经急剧下降。这个相当戏剧性的表达描述了销售额的大幅下降。 Neil(尼尔)This is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else.这是因为选择紧凑型相机的那种消费者现在正在选择智能手机上的相机。当你选择某样东西时，你自己选择了它，而不是其他东西。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)For people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone.对于想要以快速、易于使用和方便的方式拍摄质量合理的照片的人来说，紧凑型相机曾经是最佳选择 —— 但现在它是智能手机。 Neil(尼尔)So camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again.因此，相机制造商现在正在转向更高端的市场，即 DSLR 和无反光镜相机。那么谁还在购买这些更昂贵的相机呢？又是 Phil Hall。 Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)I think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit.我认为这是……其中一些人拿起智能手机，以这种方式进入摄影领域，这是进入摄影界的非常好的第一步，我认为人们有时可能会对质量感到有点沮丧，一旦他们开始提高自己的创意技能，然后看看下一步会发生什么，所以人们想要拓宽他们的创意技能。 Neil(尼尔)Who does he say might be buying cameras?他说谁可能会购买相机？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)He says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones.他说，从事摄影的人可能会对智能手机的质量感到沮丧。 Neil(尼尔)Getting into something means becoming very interested in it.进入某样东西意味着对它非常感兴趣。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it.如果你对某件事感到沮丧，那就意味着你对它感到失望。你对它不满意。 Neil(尼尔)So people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’.因此，那些使用智能手机开始摄影但对其局限性感到沮丧并希望更具创意的人将更上一层楼。他们正在上升，正如 Phil 所说，他们正在迈出“下一个梯级”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level.现在，梯级是梯子的水平台阶，所以 takes the next rung up 这句话是描述在更高层次上做某事的一种方式。 Neil(尼尔)Now, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again.现在，说到更高级别，你对本周的测验问题理解正确吗？问题是：第一款带有数码相机的手机是什么时候发布的？是 2000 年、2004 年还是 2007 年？第一款带有数码相机的手机于 2000 年发布。现在，为了带我们进入节目的结尾，让我们再次看一下词汇。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)First we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice.首先，我们有形容词 obsolete，它描述了已被替换且不再是首选的事物。 Neil(尼尔)When the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time.例如，当 drop off a cliff 一词用于销售数字时，表示销售额在短时间内大幅下降。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)To opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it.To choose for something 意味着选择某事，当你对一项活动非常感兴趣时，你可以说你进入了它。 Neil(尼尔)If you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated.如果你正在尝试做某事但因为你没有技能或你使用的设备不正确或不够好而无法做到，你可能会感到沮丧。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up.将您的技能发展到更高的水平可以被描述为更上一层楼。 Neil(尼尔)Right, that’s all from us from us in this programme.

NeilAnd I’m Neil. CatherineNow, Neil, you’re a dad, aren’t you? NeilI am a dad. How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes? CatherineI thought that was just your age. NeilWell, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think? CatherineI think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer? Dr Anna MachinThere’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was. NeilHow many reasons does she mention? CatherineShe mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next. NeilAnother reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it. CatherineYes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true. NeilThere was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again. Dr Anna MachinThere’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was. NeilSo what is it about some father’s own dads that they didn’t like? Here’s Dr Machin again. Dr Anna MachinWell, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are. NeilShe talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children. CatherineYes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong. NeilThese days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners. CatherineAnd talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question. NeilYes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%? CatherineAnd I said a very optimistic 95%. NeilBeing optimistic is good obviously because you are correct. CatherineThat’s fantastic! NeilAnd now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary… CatherineWe started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit. NeilWhich one? CatherineThe one that you left on the desk. NeilThat’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor. CatherineWhat? Yuck! NeilYeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something. CatherineThen we had to go along with something. This is when you agree to do something even if you are not keen on it. NeilAn absent father is one who is not at home to spend time with his children. CatherineAnd some fathers are disciplinarians. They have strict rules and they give out punishments but these days more fathers are hands-on which means they are ‘very much involved’ in looking after and bringing up their children. NeilWell, that’s all we have time for today. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye! CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.您好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil.我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now, Neil, you’re a dad, aren’t you?现在，尼尔，你已经当爸爸了，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)I am a dad. How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes?我当爸爸了。你怎么知道的？是我胡须上的白发吗？是眼睛周围的皱纹吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I thought that was just your age.我以为那只是你的年龄。 Neil(尼尔)Well, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think?嗯，是的，也许吧。在今天的节目中，我们将讨论父亲以及这些年来成为父亲的变化。但在我们听到更多关于这个话题的信息之前，我们今天的问题。根据英国最近的研究，当孩子出生时，男性在场的百分比是多少？是吗。。。a） 55%；b） 75% c） 95% 你怎么看？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%.我认为现在很多男人都喜欢看到他们的孩子出生。这在文化上并不合适，所以我会追求 95%。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer?好吧，我们会在节目结束时了解您是否正确。现在，Anna Machin 博士是一位进化人类学家。她研究人类行为如何变化以及正在发生变化。她写了一本书，叫《爸爸的生活》。她一直在研究新爸爸，并在 BBC 的 Woman’s Hour 节目中谈到了她的研究。她问为什么男人想成为父亲。她首先说有很多原因，但她在回答中提到了多少？ Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.男人想当爸爸的原因有很多……对他们中的一些人来说，这只是他们已经到达的人生阶段。他们有房子，有工作，现在是组建家庭的时候了。有时他们承认实际上他们并不那么热衷，但他们的伴侣想要一个孩子，所以他们有点同意。有相当多的人实际上说他们这样做是因为他们想撤销父亲对他们所做的一切，所以改写与父亲和父亲经历有关的历史，成为比他们父亲更好的父亲。 Neil(尼尔)How many reasons does she mention?她提到了多少个原因？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)She mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next.她提到了三个原因。首先是那是人生中的那个时期 —— 伙计们有家和工作，生孩子是接下来要做的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Another reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it.另一个原因是这是他们的合作伙伴想要的，即使他们自己并不那么热衷。如果你对某件事不热衷，那就意味着你 “对它不热衷”，这不是你真正想做的事情，但因为这是他们的伴侣想要的，所以他们同意了，或者正如 Machin 博士所说，他们同意了。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true.是的，顺从某事是一个短语，意思是“同意做”某事，即使你并不是真的想做。有趣的是，Machin 博士说，一些男性承认这一点。承认某事就是说或同意某件事是真的，即使你可能为此感到羞耻或你不希望它是真的。 Neil(尼尔)There was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again.她还提到了一个原因，那就是一些男人成为父母是因为他们想成为一个比自己的父亲更好的父亲。让我们再听一遍。 Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.男人想当爸爸的原因有很多……对他们中的一些人来说，这只是他们已经到达的人生阶段。他们有房子，有工作，现在是组建家庭的时候了。有时他们承认实际上他们并不那么热衷，但他们的伴侣想要一个孩子，所以他们有点同意。有相当多的人实际上说他们这样做是因为他们想撤销父亲对他们所做的一切，所以改写与父亲和父亲经历有关的历史，成为比他们父亲更好的父亲。 Neil(尼尔)So what is it about some father’s own dads that they didn’t like? Here’s Dr Machin again.那么，他们不喜欢一些父亲自己的爸爸的什么呢？又是 Machin 博士。 Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)Well, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are.嗯，在某些情况下，你知道，父亲会疏忽大意，有些父亲缺席，而另一些父亲只是觉得自己非常，我想，我们会说一个 1950 年代的父亲如此疏远，管教者实际上没有参与孩子的日常生活，当然也没有参与他们的照顾。所以，今天的一代父亲，即使在我研究父亲的 10 年里，我们也看到了父亲亲力亲为的方式发生了巨大的变化。 Neil(尼尔)She talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children.她在那里谈到了过去与父亲相关的一些负面特征。她认为，一些父亲与儿子的关系不是很密切，他们不在，这意味着他们不经常在家，并且“没有花时间”陪伴孩子。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong.是的，有些父亲被视为管教者。这描述了一个人与孩子的主要沟通是给他们严格的规则，如果他们做错了什么，就会责备他们或惩罚他们。 Neil(尼尔)These days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners.根据 Machin 博士的说法，如今，父亲们更加亲力亲为。这句话的意思是他们“更多地参与”自己的孩子，并与伴侣共同抚养孩子。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question.说到分享，Neil，来吧 —— 是时候知道今天问题的答案了。 Neil(尼尔)Yes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%?确实是的。根据英国最近的研究，孩子出生时在场的父亲的百分比是多少？是 55%、75% 还是 95%？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And I said a very optimistic 95%.我说非常乐观的 95%。 Neil(尼尔)Being optimistic is good obviously because you are correct.乐观显然是好的，因为你是对的。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s fantastic!太棒了！ Neil(尼尔)And now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary…现在，为了另一个很棒的事情，我们对今天词汇的回顾…… Catherine(凯瑟 琳)We started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit.我们首先承认你说某件事是真的，即使它可能会让你看起来有点糟糕。在我们继续之前，我不得不承认，尼尔，是我吃了你的饼干。 Neil(尼尔)Which one?哪一个？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)The one that you left on the desk.你留在桌子上的那个。 Neil(尼尔)That’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor.没关系。反正我并不是很热衷于它。它一直在地板上。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)What? Yuck!什么？呸！ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something.是的，嗯，它为您服务！而 to be keen on something 是我们的下一个短语，意思是 “对某事非常感兴趣和热情”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Then we had to go along with something. This is when you agree to do something even if you are not keen on it.然后我们不得不接受一些事情。这是你同意做某事的时候，即使你并不热衷于它。 Neil(尼尔)An absent father is one who is not at home to spend time with his children.缺席的父亲是指不在家陪伴孩子的父亲。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And some fathers are disciplinarians. They have strict rules and they give out punishments but these days more fathers are hands-on which means they are ‘very much involved’ in looking after and bringing up their children.有些父亲是管教者。他们有严格的规定，他们给予惩罚，但现在越来越多的父亲亲力亲为，这意味着他们“非常参与”照顾和抚养孩子。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s all we have time for today.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilNow, if you want to fight climate change – what can you do? CatherineWell, you can use less electricity… NeilOr stop driving… CatherineBut scientists believe there’s another behaviour which has an even bigger impact on the planet, and that is what you eat. NeilWe’re talking about meat here. If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets – harmful emissions could be reduced by 70%. That’s according to research from Oxford University. CatherineNow emissions are the gases produced by an activity or living thing – so we could talk about factory emissions or farming emissions. NeilAnd if you eat no meat or animal products you’re what we call ‘vegan’. More and more people around the world are going vegan. And today’s question: which of these celebrities is vegan? Is it… a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus? CatherineAnd I’m going to go for…c) Miley Cyrus. NeilWell, we’ll find out at the end of the programme. Now, before we go much further, why don’t we find out a bit more about exactly what it means to be vegan? CatherineHere’s Tom Kuehnel from the Vegan Society in the UK. Tom Kuehnel, Vegan SocietyVeganism is a way of living which excludes, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals. So that’s for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don’t want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age. It’s never been easier to be vegan. NeilOf course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it’s all about, but that doesn’t just mean food. If you’re a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out - no more leather shoes! CatherineBut he feels that it’s easier than ever before to become vegan – and uses a nice phrase: “in this day and age”. NeilYes. It means ‘these days’, or ‘in the present time’ – and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time. CatherineSo, many people go vegan for ethical reasons. Now ethical is a useful word, it means ‘relating to moral beliefs’, so if you become vegan for ethical reasons, you do it because you think it’s wrong to eat or use animal products. NeilOthers go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing livestock – that means animals like cows and pigs – produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let’s just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose veganism… CatherineVeganism – now, that’s the noun for the diet. Neil… is because they believe it is healthier. CatherineIn the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier, scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan. NeilNow, that’s human deaths. They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat, and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables – as well as fewer people being overweight. CatherineAnd they say that this would have an economic impact too. They suggest that up to $1,000bn a year would be saved due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work - because fewer people would get sick. NeilSo, if it’s all so simple – why don’t we all go vegan tomorrow? CatherineWell, meat-eating is an important part of most cultures – not everyone wants to change. NeilAnd millions of people worldwide raise livestock for a living. CatherineSo these jobs would disappear. Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be arid – which means dry and unable to support crops - people living in these regions rely on livestock, so people for example like the Berbers in the Sahara region. NeilWithout animal farming they would be forced to abandon traditional nomadic lifestyles – that’s where they move from place to place - and settle in cities. CatherineAnd for many people, well, they just like eating meat and dairy. NeilWe asked you about well-known vegans: which of these is vegan? a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus? CatherineAnd I said it was Miley Cyrus. NeilWell, you’re kind of half right, Catherine. In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan. Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently. CatherineNow, why don’t we wrap up by looking at today’s vocabulary one more time? NeilWell – we started with emissions: gases produced by something or an activity such as digestion. Livestock emissions for example – are gases produced by animals. CatherineWe can also add a word that describes a kind of emissions, like methane emissions or greenhouse gas emissions. NeilNext up we had in this day and age – which means ‘these days’. CatherineI still can’t believe you still don’t have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil. NeilWell, maybe I just object to smartphones for ethical reasons! CatherineSo you have for moral reasons to smartphones? NeilYeah, for me it’s important to understand the conditions of the workers in the factory where the smartphone is made. CatherineThat’s fair enough then. But, Neil, you haven’t become vegan yet for ethical reasons, have you? NeilYou’ve got me there – I admire veganism but I still like cheese too much to do it! Veganism is the noun. CatherineThat’s right. So two more words to go – we have arid and livestock. Arid describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants. NeilBut arid regions can sometimes support livestock – livestock means farm animals. If you think of the ‘stock’ as being the assets of a business, then animals are ‘living’ or ‘live’ stock. CatherineAnd that brings us to the end of today’s programme. Join us on our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages for lots more! Let us know what you think of veganism! NeilBye for now. CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine.我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)Now, if you want to fight climate change – what can you do?现在，如果您想应对气候变化 – 您能做些什么？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, you can use less electricity…嗯，你可以用更少的电…… Neil(尼尔)Or stop driving…或者停止驾驶…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)But scientists believe there’s another behaviour which has an even bigger impact on the planet, and that is what you eat.但科学家们认为，还有另一种行为对地球的影响更大，那就是你吃的东西。 Neil(尼尔)We’re talking about meat here. If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets – harmful emissions could be reduced by 70%. That’s according to research from Oxford University.我们在这里谈论的是肉类。如果人们从饮食中不吃肉类和动物产品，有害排放可以减少 70%。这是根据牛津大学的研究得出的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now emissions are the gases produced by an activity or living thing – so we could talk about factory emissions or farming emissions.现在，排放是活动或生物产生的气体 —— 所以我们可以谈论工厂排放或农业排放。 Neil(尼尔)And if you eat no meat or animal products you’re what we call ‘vegan’. More and more people around the world are going vegan. And today’s question: which of these celebrities is vegan? Is it… a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus?如果您不吃肉类或动物产品，您就是我们所说的“素食主义者”。世界各地越来越多的人开始吃纯素。今天的问题是：这些名人中哪些是纯素的？是吗。。。a） 布拉德·皮特，b） 詹妮弗·洛佩兹或 c） 麦莉·赛勒斯？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m going to go for…c) Miley Cyrus.我要去……c） 麦莉·赛勒斯。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out at the end of the programme. Now, before we go much further, why don’t we find out a bit more about exactly what it means to be vegan?好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，在我们进一步讨论之前，我们为什么不更多地了解纯素的确切含义呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Here’s Tom Kuehnel from the Vegan Society in the UK.这是来自英国素食协会的 Tom Kuehnel。 Tom Kuehnel, Vegan Society(汤姆·库内尔，素食协会)Veganism is a way of living which excludes, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals. So that’s for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don’t want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age. It’s never been easier to be vegan.纯素主义是一种生活方式，它尽可能地排除一切形式的剥削和虐待动物。所以那是为了食物、衣服或任何其他目的。所以我们只是不想使用或虐待动物。我们觉得，你知道，这个时代有很多选择。成为纯素从未如此简单。 Neil(尼尔)Of course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it’s all about, but that doesn’t just mean food. If you’re a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out - no more leather shoes!当然，他说避免虐待动物就是它的全部意义所在，但这不仅仅意味着食物。如果您是真正的素食主义者，那么动物的服装也已经过时了 - 不再有皮鞋！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But he feels that it’s easier than ever before to become vegan – and uses a nice phrase: “in this day and age”.但他觉得成为纯素者比以往任何时候都容易 —— 并用了一个好词：“在这个时代”。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. It means ‘these days’, or ‘in the present time’ – and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time.是的。它的意思是“这些日子”或“在现在” —— 通常用于突出与以前的对比。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, many people go vegan for ethical reasons. Now ethical is a useful word, it means ‘relating to moral beliefs’, so if you become vegan for ethical reasons, you do it because you think it’s wrong to eat or use animal products.因此，许多人出于道德原因成为素食主义者。现在道德是一个有用的词，它的意思是“与道德信仰有关”，所以如果你出于道德原因成为纯素者，你这样做是因为你认为吃或使用动物产品是错误的。 Neil(尼尔)Others go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing livestock – that means animals like cows and pigs – produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let’s just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose veganism…正如我们之前看到的，其他人出于环境考虑而成为素食主义者。饲养牲畜（即牛和猪等动物）会产生大量有害的甲烷气体。现在，我们只能说动物自己从他们的身体中产生了很多 IT。选择素食主义的另一个主要原因…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Veganism – now, that’s the noun for the diet.素食主义 – 现在，这是饮食的名词。 Neil(尼尔)… is because they believe it is healthier.…是因为他们认为它更健康。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)In the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier, scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan.在我们之前提到的牛津大学研究中，科学家们发现，如果世界实行纯素，每年可以避免 800 万人死亡。 Neil(尼尔)Now, that’s human deaths. They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat, and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables – as well as fewer people being overweight.现在，那是人类死亡。他们声称，这个数字的一半是因为我们不再吃红肉，另一半是由于吃了更多健康的水果和蔬菜 —— 以及更少的超重者。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And they say that this would have an economic impact too. They suggest that up to $1,000bn a year would be saved due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work - because fewer people would get sick.他们说，这也会产生经济影响。他们建议，由于降低医疗保健成本和提高工作效率，每年将节省高达 10000 亿美元 —— 因为生病的人数减少了。 Neil(尼尔)So, if it’s all so simple – why don’t we all go vegan tomorrow?那么，如果一切都这么简单 —— 为什么我们明天不都成为纯素呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, meat-eating is an important part of most cultures – not everyone wants to change.嗯，吃肉是大多数文化的重要组成部分 —— 不是每个人都想改变。 Neil(尼尔)And millions of people worldwide raise livestock for a living.全世界有数百万人以饲养牲畜为生。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So these jobs would disappear. Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be arid – which means dry and unable to support crops - people living in these regions rely on livestock, so people for example like the Berbers in the Sahara region.所以这些工作会消失。现在，据估计，地球上有多达三分之一的土地是干旱的，这意味着干旱且无法维持农作物的生长，生活在这些地区的人们依赖畜牧业，例如撒哈拉地区的柏柏尔人。 Neil(尼尔)Without animal farming they would be forced to abandon traditional nomadic lifestyles – that’s where they move from place to place - and settle in cities.如果没有畜牧业，他们将被迫放弃传统的游牧生活方式 —— 那是他们从一个地方迁移到另一个地方的地方 —— 并在城市定居。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And for many people, well, they just like eating meat and dairy.对许多人来说，他们就是喜欢吃肉和奶制品。 Neil(尼尔)We asked you about well-known vegans: which of these is vegan? a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus?我们询问了您有关知名素食主义者的信息：哪些是素食主义者？a） 布拉德·皮特，b） 詹妮弗·洛佩兹或 c） 麦莉·赛勒斯？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said it was Miley Cyrus.我说是麦莉·赛勒斯。 Neil(尼尔)Well, you’re kind of half right, Catherine. In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan. Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently.嗯，你说对了一半，Catherine。事实上，布拉德·皮特和麦莉·赛勒斯都是素食主义者。詹妮弗·洛佩兹 （Jennifer Lopez） 曾经是，但显然后来又开始吃肉了。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, why don’t we wrap up by looking at today’s vocabulary one more time?现在，我们为什么不再看一遍今天的词汇呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well – we started with emissions: gases produced by something or an activity such as digestion. Livestock emissions for example – are gases produced by animals.嗯 - 我们从排放开始：由某物或活动（如消化）产生的气体。例如，牲畜排放物是动物产生的气体。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)We can also add a word that describes a kind of emissions, like methane emissions or greenhouse gas emissions.我们还可以添加一个描述某种排放的词，例如甲烷排放或温室气体排放。 Neil(尼尔)Next up we had in this day and age – which means ‘these days’.接下来我们在这个时代 —— 意思是“这些日子”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I still can’t believe you still don’t have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil.我仍然不敢相信你在这个时代仍然没有智能手机，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe I just object to smartphones for ethical reasons!好吧，也许我只是出于道德原因反对智能手机！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)So you have for moral reasons to smartphones?所以你有出于道德原因对智能手机吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, for me it’s important to understand the conditions of the workers in the factory where the smartphone is made.是的，对我来说，了解智能手机生产工厂中工人的条件很重要。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s fair enough then. But, Neil, you haven’t become vegan yet for ethical reasons, have you?这很公平。但是，尼尔，出于道德原因，你还没有成为纯素者，对吧？ Neil(尼尔)You’ve got me there – I admire veganism but I still like cheese too much to do it! Veganism is the noun.你明白了 - 我钦佩素食主义，但我仍然太喜欢奶酪了！素食主义是名词。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. So two more words to go – we have arid and livestock. Arid describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants.没错。所以还有两个词要说 —— 我们有干旱和牲畜。干旱是指过于干燥而无法种植许多农作物或植物的土地。 Neil(尼尔)But arid regions can sometimes support livestock – livestock means farm animals. If you think of the ‘stock’ as being the assets of a business, then animals are ‘living’ or ‘live’ stock.但干旱地区有时可以养活畜牧业 —— 畜牧业是指农场动物。如果您将“存量”视为企业的资产，那么动物就是“活的”或“活的”存量。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that brings us to the end of today’s programme.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long. NeilYes. It’s 6 Minute English! CatherineAnd we have a challenge for everyone – can you stay focused for the full six minutes? NeilSounds easy? Maybe not, because today we’re talking about our attention spans: are they shrinking? CatherineThat’s right, so we’re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something – that’s our attention span – actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that – in fact, it claims the human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish. NeilCan that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media – these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it… a) around 30 minutes, b) around two and a half hours, or c) over three hours? CatherineI tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I’m going to say around two and a half hours - that’s answer ‘b’. NeilOK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it’s fallen to just eight seconds. CatherineRight, and that’s a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they’re to blame for all these distractions – now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention. NeilYes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier – goldfish reportedly have an attention span of nine seconds. That’s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds! CatherineAnd there’s a phrase in English – we say ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’. Or ‘the memory of a goldfish’. So these poor… poor gold goldfish, Neil. NeilYes, they get a bad press, don’t they? That’s a phrase which means ‘criticism’ – especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers – or the ‘press’, as we call it. CatherineSo – is it really true than humans are now even more easily distracted than fish? NeilWell, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim. CatherineThat’s right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly – they couldn’t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn’t find scientific evidence that our attention spans are in fact shrinking. NeilAnd secondly – the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring attention spans in the first place. It’s a term that’s widely used, but it’s not very scientific. CatherineSounds fishy. NeilYes. Fishy means ‘suspicious’, by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again. CatherineSo, are we humans in fact more easily distracted than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days. Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open UniversityIt’s all down to the individual; it’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone’s distracted by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn’t mean that they then don’t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task. NeilSo she says we’re not necessarily more easily distracted. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks. CatherineThat’s right. She’s really saying we can multitask better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time. NeilShe said: “It’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention.” Let’s just highlight that phrase down to. Here, it means ‘depends on’. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention. CatherineSo – maybe our attention spans aren’t getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more. NeilWhich reminds me today’s question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said? CatherineWell, my attention span is not that short that I can’t remember that I said two and a half hours. NeilAnd the answer – if you believe the research – is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine. CatherineThank you. NeilThat comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine? CatherineI try not to, what about you? NeilIt’s probably more than that to be honest. Now, I’m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones – or maybe they’re even touching them now as they listen – but either way, let’s have a review of today’s phrases. CatherineOK, so first we had attention span – that’s the length of time we can focus on something. And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be… Neil? Neil? NeilSorry – I just got distracted there by a message on my phone. Apologies. CatherineThat’s alright. So, next up we had a bad press. Goldfish get a bad press. Social media gets a bad press. And this means they all get criticism in the media. NeilAnd we had fishy. If something’s fishy, it’s suspicious. CatherineAnd we had multitask. To multitask is to do several things at once. NeilThen we had down to. Here it means ‘depends on’, though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it’s all down to the context! CatherineAnd that’s our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you distracted? NeilIf you’re looking for distractions – may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages? BothGoodbye. 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long.我是 Catherine。现在，这个节目时长为六分钟。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. It’s 6 Minute English!是的。这是六分钟英语！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we have a challenge for everyone – can you stay focused for the full six minutes?我们向每个人提出了一个挑战 - 您能否在整整六分钟内保持专注？ Neil(尼尔)Sounds easy? Maybe not, because today we’re talking about our attention spans: are they shrinking?听起来很容易？也许不是，因为今天我们谈论的是我们的注意力持续时间：它们是否在缩小？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right, so we’re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something – that’s our attention span – actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that – in fact, it claims the human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish.没错，所以我们今天要问的是：我们可以专注于某件事的时间长度 —— 即我们的注意力持续时间 —— 真的变短了吗？现在，一项研究表明 —— 事实上，它声称人类的注意力持续时间现在比金鱼还短。 Neil(尼尔)Can that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media – these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it… a) around 30 minutes, b) around two and a half hours, or c) over three hours?这是真的吗？智能手机、互联网、社交媒体 —— 这些肯定都占据了我们的很多注意力。但多少呢？我们平均一天看手机多长时间？是吗。。。a） 大约 30 分钟，b） 大约两个半小时，还是 c） 超过 3 小时？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I’m going to say around two and a half hours - that’s answer ‘b’.我通常很忙，但我知道有些人真的沉迷于他们的手机，所以我要说大约两个半小时 - 这就是答案 ‘b’。 Neil(尼尔)OK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it’s fallen to just eight seconds.好的，那么，Microsoft 发布的一份报告称，2000 年人类的平均注意力持续时间为 12 秒。从那时起，它下降到只有 8 秒。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Right, and that’s a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they’re to blame for all these distractions – now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.是的，这是在很短的时间内发生的巨大变化。现在，2000 年正好是数字媒体和智能手机繁荣之前，因此许多人认为所有这些干扰都应该归咎于他们 —— 现在，干扰是夺走我们注意力或注意力的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier – goldfish reportedly have an attention span of nine seconds. That’s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds!是的。我们之前提到了金鱼 —— 据报道，金鱼的注意力持续时间为 9 秒。这比痴迷于手机的人类仅仅 8 秒多了 1 秒！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And there’s a phrase in English – we say ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’. Or ‘the memory of a goldfish’. So these poor… poor gold goldfish, Neil.英语中有一句话 —— 我们说 ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’。或“金鱼的记忆”。所以这些可怜的……可怜的金鱼，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, they get a bad press, don’t they? That’s a phrase which means ‘criticism’ – especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers – or the ‘press’, as we call it.是的，他们受到了不好的报道，不是吗？这个短语的意思是“批评” —— 尤其是媒体和报纸上的批评 —— 或者我们称之为“新闻”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So – is it really true than humans are now even more easily distracted than fish?那么 —— 人类现在真的比鱼更容易分心吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim.好吧，BBC 广播节目 More or Less 最近调查了这一说法。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly – they couldn’t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn’t find scientific evidence that our attention spans are in fact shrinking.没错。他们发现了几件事。首先 - 他们找不到 Microsoft 在其报告中引用的研究的证据。换句话说，该计划找不到科学证据证明我们的注意力持续时间实际上正在缩小。 Neil(尼尔)And secondly – the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring attention spans in the first place. It’s a term that’s widely used, but it’s not very scientific.其次 —— 他们采访的心理学家说，首先测量注意力持续时间的想法存在问题。这是一个被广泛使用的术语，但它不是很科学。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sounds fishy.听起来很可疑。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. Fishy means ‘suspicious’, by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again.是的。顺便说一句，Fishy 的意思是“可疑的”。对不起，金鱼。再。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, are we humans in fact more easily distracted than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days.那么，我们人类实际上是否比以前更容易分心呢？或多或少地问了开放大学的心理学家杰玛·布里格斯（Gemma Briggs）博士，如今人类是否不太能集中注意力。 Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open University(GemmaBriggs博士，开放大学心理学讲师)It’s all down to the individual; it’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone’s distracted by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn’t mean that they then don’t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task.这一切都取决于个人；这完全取决于您选择如何应用注意力。因此，注意力切换能力很可能是在近年来，在智能手机和互联网时代发展起来的。但是，因为有人被智能手机分散了注意力或想快速用谷歌搜索某事，这并不意味着他们在执行另一项任务时没有能力和维持注意力的能力。 Neil(尼尔)So she says we’re not necessarily more easily distracted. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.所以她说我们不一定更容易分心。相反，我们实际上可能更擅长在不同任务之间快速切换注意力。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. She’s really saying we can multitask better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time.没错。她真的是在说我们可以比以前更好地同时处理多项任务。这意味着我们可以专注于许多不同的任务，每项任务的时间更短。 Neil(尼尔)She said: “It’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention.” Let’s just highlight that phrase down to. Here, it means ‘depends on’. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.她说：“这完全取决于你选择如何集中注意力。让我们把这句话具体强调一下。在这里，它的意思是 ‘depends on’。这完全取决于您选择如何应用注意力。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So – maybe our attention spans aren’t getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more.所以 - 也许我们的注意力持续时间并没有变短，我们只是选择更多地看手机。 Neil(尼尔)Which reminds me today’s question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said?这让我想起了今天的问题。我问你，我们平均花多长时间看手机，你说？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, my attention span is not that short that I can’t remember that I said two and a half hours.嗯，我的注意力持续时间并没有短到我记不清我说的是两个半小时。 Neil(尼尔)And the answer – if you believe the research – is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine.答案 - 如果你相信这项研究 - 是每天 2.42 小时，所以，猜得不错，凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you.谢谢。 Neil(尼尔)That comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine?该数据来自总部位于芝加哥的研究公司 Dscout。那么呢：他们调查的群体每天触摸他们的手机超过 2,600 次。Catherine 先生，您每天触摸手机 2,600 次吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I try not to, what about you?我尽量不这样做，你呢？ Neil(尼尔)It’s probably more than that to be honest. Now, I’m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones – or maybe they’re even touching them now as they listen – but either way, let’s have a review of today’s phrases.老实说，这可能不止于此。现在，我敢肯定每个人都想重新触摸他们的手机 —— 或者他们现在甚至在听手机时触摸它们 —— 但无论哪种方式，让我们回顾一下今天的短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK, so first we had attention span – that’s the length of time we can focus on something. And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be… Neil? Neil?好的，首先我们有了注意力持续时间 —— 这是我们可以专注于某件事的时间长度。而且我的肯定比以前矮了……尼尔？尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Sorry – I just got distracted there by a message on my phone. Apologies.抱歉 - 我刚刚被手机上的消息分散了注意力。道歉。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s alright. So, next up we had a bad press. Goldfish get a bad press. Social media gets a bad press. And this means they all get criticism in the media.没关系。所以，接下来我们遇到了一个糟糕的新闻。金鱼受到了不好的报道。社交媒体受到了负面报道。这意味着他们都会受到媒体的批评。 Neil(尼尔)And we had fishy. If something’s fishy, it’s suspicious.我们吃了鱼。如果有什么可疑之处，那就是可疑的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we had multitask. To multitask is to do several things at once.而且我们有多任务。多任务处理是指同时做几件事。 Neil(尼尔)Then we had down to. Here it means ‘depends on’, though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it’s all down to the context!然后我们不得不开始。在这里，它的意思是 ‘depends on’，尽管在其他上下文中它可以表示其他事物。你可以说，这一切都取决于上下文！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that’s our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you distracted?这就是我们的快速回顾，也是我们今天的计划。那么，你是否一直保持专注？还是你分心了？ Neil(尼尔)If you’re looking for distractions – may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages?如果您正在寻找分散注意力的信息 - 我可以推荐我们的 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 页面吗？ Both(双)Goodbye.再见。 【核心词汇】attention spanthe length of time you can focus on something注意力持续时间你可以集中注意力的时长。A goldfish has an attention span of only nine seconds.金鱼的注意力持续时间只有9秒。 to distractto take someone’s focus away from something分散注意力把某人的注意力从某事上移开The music was so loud that it distracted me from my work.音乐太吵了，分散了我的工作注意力。 a bad presscriticism in the media媒体负面评价媒体上的批评The project has had a bad press from the start.这个项目从一开始就受到了媒体的负面评价。 fishysuspicious可疑的引起怀疑的Something fishy is going on here.这里面有些蹊跷。 to multitaskto do several things at once同时处理多项任务一次做几件事Women are better at multitasking than men.女性比男性更擅长同时处理多项任务。 down to(here) depending on取决于依赖于The decision is down to you.这个决定取决于你。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】你浪费了多少食物？","path":"/2017/05/11/wechat-2017-05-11/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it. DanNeil, you know you shouldn’t waste food. NeilWaste meaning to throw away without consuming or using. Ah, it’s only an apple. It’s not the end of the world, Dan. DanWell, that’s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week’s question. How much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter NeilI’m not sure. I know it’s a lot so I’m going to say a) a half DanWe’ll find out if you’re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food, which is enough to feed a billion hungry people. Where do you think all this food waste comes from? NeilWell, restaurants, I imagine. I mean, they can’t give one customer’s leftovers to another! That would be unhygienic! DanLeftovers are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste. NeilSupermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by. DanThink closer to home. NeilIt’s us, isn’t it? DanYes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it? NeilI want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it’s not. DanNo. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays. NeilA landfill is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change. DanExactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%. NeilThat’s impressive, how did that happen? DanThey attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul. NeilI’ve heard about her. She became a household name in Denmark overnight! DanA household name is one which everybody knows, and that’s right. NeilI thought she was Russian? DanShe is. But, I’ll let her explain. Selina JuulI come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of infrastructure, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this abundance, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted. NeilSo Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of infrastructure, meaning the basic systems and services of a society – such as food transportation. DanThen when she moved to Denmark, she found an abundance, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted. NeilSo she decided to do something about it? DanYes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’ and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste. NeilHow did she do it? DanWell, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She’s produced a leftovers cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools. NeilWow, she’s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question. DanSure! I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter NeilAnd I said a) a half DanAnd I’m terribly sorry, mate, but you’re wrong. The answer is b) a third. NeilWell, it’s not as bad as I thought it was, at least. DanShall we look at the vocabulary then? NeilYes, let’s. First we had waste. If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we waste are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with waste too. Can you think of one, Dan? DanA waste of space is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can’t cook at all. Next we had leftovers. Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your leftovers, Neil? NeilOh I love leftovers! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal! DanI agree! Pizza’s a great example! NeilThen we had landfill. A landfill is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a dump. Do you ever take your rubbish to the dump, Dan? DanNot if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had a household name. To be a household name is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil? NeilOh, that’s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had infrastructure. Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society – such as electricity supply, trains, and roads. DanAnd finally we had abundance. If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in abundance, Neil? NeilWell, when it comes to my children I have to have an abundance of patience….well, most of the time. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! DanAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this episode we’ll be discussing food waste, just as soon as我是 Neil。在这一集中，我们将讨论食物浪费，只要 Dan(担)Neil, did you just throw the rest of that apple away?尼尔，你刚才把剩下的苹果都扔掉了吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah. It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it.是的。这是一个相当大的问题，我无法完成它。 Dan(担)Neil, you know you shouldn’t waste food.Neil，你知道你不应该浪费食物。 Neil(尼尔)Waste meaning to throw away without consuming or using. Ah, it’s only an apple. It’s not the end of the world, Dan.浪费的意思是不消费也不用就扔掉。啊，这只是一个苹果。这不是世界末日，丹。 Dan(担)Well, that’s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week’s question. How much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter嗯，这就是你可能错的地方，我的朋友。让我用本周的问题向你证明一下。世界上每年浪费多少食物？a） 二分之一 b） 三分之一 c） 四分之一 Neil(尼尔)I’m not sure. I know it’s a lot so I’m going to say a) a half我不确定。我知道这很多，所以我要说 a） 一半 Dan(担)We’ll find out if you’re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food, which is enough to feed a billion hungry people. Where do you think all this food waste comes from?我们将在本次节目结束时找出您的判断是否正确。因此，实际数字是 13 亿吨食物，足以养活 10 亿饥饿的人。您认为所有这些食物垃圾来自哪里？ Neil(尼尔)Well, restaurants, I imagine. I mean, they can’t give one customer’s leftovers to another! That would be unhygienic!嗯，我想是餐馆。我的意思是，他们不能把一个顾客的剩菜给另一个顾客！那太不卫生了！ Dan(担)Leftovers are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste.剩菜是未食用的食物残渣。虽然你是对的，但餐馆并不是食物浪费的主要来源。 Neil(尼尔)Supermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by.超市！我敢打赌，一旦食物超过了保质期或可以合法销售的日期，他们就会扔掉一大堆食物。 Dan(担)Think closer to home.想得更近一些。 Neil(尼尔)It’s us, isn’t it?是我们，不是吗？ Dan(担)Yes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it?是的。在欧洲，令人难以置信的是，53% 的食物垃圾来自家庭，每年造成 8800 万吨食物浪费。我敢打赌你猜不出我们用它做什么？ Neil(尼尔)I want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it’s not.我想说回收，但我可以从你的脸上看出，Dan，它不是。 Dan(担)No. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays.不。不幸的是，它进入垃圾填埋场并腐烂。 Neil(尼尔)A landfill is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change.垃圾填埋场是掩埋垃圾的地方。我明白了，所以食物会腐烂，这会导致温室气体，从而导致全球变暖和气候变化。 Dan(担)Exactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%.没错，世界末日。但是，值得注意的是，欧洲国家丹麦已经成功地将其食物浪费减少了 25%。 Neil(尼尔)That’s impressive, how did that happen?这太令人印象深刻了，这是怎么发生的呢？ Dan(担)They attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul.他们将其归功于一位名叫 Selina Juul 的女士。 Neil(尼尔)I’ve heard about her. She became a household name in Denmark overnight!我听说过她。她一夜之间成为丹麦家喻户晓的名字！ Dan(担)A household name is one which everybody knows, and that’s right.家喻户晓的名字是每个人都知道的名字，没错。 Neil(尼尔)I thought she was Russian?我以为她是俄罗斯人？ Dan(担)She is. But, I’ll let her explain.她是。但是，我会让她解释。 Selina Juul(塞琳娜·朱尔)I come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of infrastructure, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this abundance, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.我来自一个食物短缺的国家，当时在莫斯科，共产主义崩溃了，我们的基础设施崩溃了，我们不确定我们能否在餐桌上买到食物。来到丹麦，看到这里丰富多彩，看到这些超市里装满了食物。但后来我真的很震惊地看到很多食物被浪费了。 Neil(尼尔)So Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of infrastructure, meaning the basic systems and services of a society – such as food transportation.因此，Selina 在莫斯科长大，当时由于基础设施的崩溃，食物不足，这意味着一个社会的基本系统和服务 —— 例如食品运输。 Dan(担)Then when she moved to Denmark, she found an abundance, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted.然后，当她搬到丹麦时，她发现食物丰富，或者说绰绰有余，但她看到这些食物被浪费了。 Neil(尼尔)So she decided to do something about it?所以她决定做点什么？ Dan(担)Yes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’ and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste.是的。她在 2008 年开设了一个名为“停止浪费食物”的 Facebook 页面，9 年后，丹麦政府将减少食物浪费归功于她。 Neil(尼尔)How did she do it?她是怎么做到的呢？ Dan(担)Well, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She’s produced a leftovers cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools.嗯，真的有很多想法。她说服一些超市停止批量销售他们的商品，让人们只购买他们需要的东西。她制作了一本剩菜食谱，并与三个政府合作，在学校设立了一项教育计划。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, she’s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question.哇，她是个大忙的女人。那么，你用本周问题的答案来教育我怎么样。 Dan(担)Sure! I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter确定！我问你，世界上每年浪费多少食物？a） 二分之一 b） 三分之一 c） 四分之一 Neil(尼尔)And I said a) a half我说 a） 一半 Dan(担)And I’m terribly sorry, mate, but you’re wrong. The answer is b) a third.我非常抱歉，伙计，但你错了。答案是 b） 三分之一。 Neil(尼尔)Well, it’s not as bad as I thought it was, at least.嗯，至少没有我想象的那么糟糕。 Dan(担)Shall we look at the vocabulary then?那么，我们应该看看这些词汇吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, let’s. First we had waste. If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we waste are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with waste too. Can you think of one, Dan?是的，让我们。首先，我们有废物。如果你浪费了什么东西，你就把它扔掉或丢失了，而没有使用它或消耗它。我们浪费的常见东西是食物、时间、金钱和精力。我们也有一些关于废物的表达。Dan，你能想到一个吗？ Dan(担)A waste of space is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can’t cook at all. Next we had leftovers. Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your leftovers, Neil?a waste of space 是一个表达方式，意思是一个东西完全没有价值。例如，我在厨房里完全浪费了空间。我根本不会做饭。接下来我们吃剩菜。剩菜是食物或饭菜的残渣，没有被吃掉。你打算怎么处理你的剩菜，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Oh I love leftovers! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal!哦，我喜欢剩菜！有时我觉得它们的味道甚至比原来的饭菜还要好！ Dan(担)I agree! Pizza’s a great example!我同意！披萨就是一个很好的例子！ Neil(尼尔)Then we had landfill. A landfill is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a dump. Do you ever take your rubbish to the dump, Dan?然后我们有了垃圾填埋场。垃圾填埋场是丢弃和掩埋垃圾的地方。在口语英语中，我们可以说，一个垃圾场。丹，你有没有把你的垃圾带到垃圾场？ Dan(担)Not if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had a household name. To be a household name is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil?如果我能帮得上忙的话，不会。我更喜欢尽可能多地回收利用。我只有在必须扔掉冰箱等大型电器时才会去垃圾场。然后我们就有了一个家喻户晓的名字。成为家喻户晓的名字就是被特定地方或文化的普通人所熟知。你能想到一个目前家喻户晓的人吗，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)Oh, that’s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had infrastructure. Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society – such as electricity supply, trains, and roads.哦，这很容易。唐纳德·特朗普浮现在脑海中！每个人都必须知道他是谁。然后我们有了基础设施。基础设施是一个社会的基本系统和服务，例如电力供应、火车和道路。 Dan(担)And finally we had abundance. If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in abundance, Neil?最后，我们得到了丰盛的财富。如果你有丰富的东西，你拥有的就比你需要的要多。有什么丰盛的东西吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Well, when it comes to my children I have to have an abundance of patience….well, most of the time. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!嗯，当涉及到我的孩子时，我必须有足够的耐心……嗯，大多数时候。这就是今天的六分钟 English 的结尾。请尽快再次加入我们！ Dan(担)And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Today we’re taking a look into the lives of the super rich – and we’re going to look at one of their favourite pastimes. NeilThe super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of assets. CatherineAssets are things we can own and sell – like property, boats and private planes. NeilExpensive toys. First things first, let’s do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years? a) China b) Brazil c) Vietnam? CatherineI’m going to go for Vietnam. I think, that’s an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future. NeilOk, well we’ll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade. CatherineNow, this doesn’t mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world’s richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world. NeilSo, my question is – what on earth do people with so much money spend it on? CatherineOne academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is …, Neil? NeilYachts! A yacht – a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate status symbol – that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society. CatherineLet’s listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What’s so unusual about yachts? Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff UniversityIf you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet – these are investable assets – something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs – and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they make good, sound business sense. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a black hole. NeilBefore we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain assets like planes and wine that made business sense. CatherineNow, to make sense – is a phrase you’ll be familiar with. So, if we say something makes business sense, it means ‘it’s good for business’. But yachts are different. NeilYachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a black hole of wealth. CatherineA black hole, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape – not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money! NeilIt’s also used conversationally to mean ‘a place where things go missing’. CatherineThese superyachts are big. The world’s longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study – she used to work on the yachts. NeilShe’s now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich. CatherineSo, what else did she learn? NeilShe says that in the world of the super rich – the size of your yacht shows your place in the pecking order. CatherineThe pecking order means ‘the social system from most powerful to least powerful’. NeilIf you’re higher up in the yachting pecking order, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently. CatherineApparently, so. It’s all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. Now that’s another great term – conspicuous means ‘visible or noticeable’ and consumption means ‘spending’. So, the phrase conspicuous consumption refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money. NeilBefore we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today’s question. CatherineI said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years. NeilWell, I’m very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam – according to the same report by Knight Frank – the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade. CatherineNow, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme? NeilVery good. We started with assets – here it means ‘things we can buy or sell’. What are your assets? CatherineOh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I’m not like you though Neil, I don’t live in an expensive mansion – that would be a real status symbol! NeilIf only that were true, but it’s a good example. A status symbol is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society. CatherineYes, and we had the phrase to make business sense – in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense. NeilOr I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they’re a black hole for our money. CatherineNow, did you know our next phrase, pecking order, actually comes from chicken behaviour? NeilAnd finally, the phrase conspicuous consumption. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is conspicuous consumption. CatherineAnd to clear up two similar phrases: a status symbol refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas conspicuous consumption refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you’re spending money so that other people notice.

Neil &amp; CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. Today we’re taking a look into the lives of the super rich – and we’re going to look at one of their favourite pastimes.我是 Catherine。今天，我们来看看超级富豪的生活 —— 我们将看看他们最喜欢的消遣方式之一。 Neil(尼尔)The super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of assets.超级富豪是拥有超过 3000 万美元资产的人。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Assets are things we can own and sell – like property, boats and private planes.资产是我们可以拥有和出售的东西，例如财产、船只和私人飞机。 Neil(尼尔)Expensive toys. First things first, let’s do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years? a) China b) Brazil c) Vietnam?昂贵的玩具。首先，让我们回答我们的问题，Catherine。预计未来 10 年哪个国家的超级富豪比例增长最快？a） 中国 b） 巴西 c） 越南？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m going to go for Vietnam. I think, that’s an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future.我要去越南。我认为，这是一个新兴的国家，我认为未来财富将有很大的增长。 Neil(尼尔)Ok, well we’ll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade.好的，我们稍后会知道你是对还是错。预计未来十年超级富豪的数量将增加 43%。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, this doesn’t mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world’s richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world.现在，这并不意味着每个人的收入都以相同的速度增长。你可能还记得去年的一份报告，其中说世界上最富有的 62 个人拥有的财产相当于全世界最贫穷的 50% 的人所拥有的财产。 Neil(尼尔)So, my question is – what on earth do people with so much money spend it on?所以，我的问题是 —— 有这么多钱的人到底把钱花在什么地方？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)One academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is …, Neil?英国的一位学者一直在研究这个问题。她的回答是……，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yachts! A yacht – a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate status symbol – that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society.游艇！游艇 – 用于娱乐的豪华船。终极身份象征 – 即让您炫耀财富和社会地位的物品。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What’s so unusual about yachts?让我们听听来自英国卡迪夫大学的 Emma Spence 的演讲。游艇有什么不寻常之处？ Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff University(EmmaSpence，卡迪夫大学博士研究员)If you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet – these are investable assets – something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs – and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they make good, sound business sense. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a black hole.如果您拥有独家葡萄酒收藏或艺术收藏，甚至购买了一架公务机 —— 这些都是可投资的资产 —— 您可以保值或累积价值。公务机（私人飞机）可以降低成本，并且比商业航空公司运行得更快、更舒适，使企业更加方便。因此，这些购买具有很好的、合理的商业意义。而超级游艇本质上是一个黑洞。 Neil(尼尔)Before we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain assets like planes and wine that made business sense.在我们进入游艇之前，Emma 谈到了某些具有商业意义的资产，例如飞机和葡萄酒。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, to make sense – is a phrase you’ll be familiar with. So, if we say something makes business sense, it means ‘it’s good for business’. But yachts are different.现在，要说得通 – 是你会熟悉的一个短语。因此，如果我们说某件事具有商业意义，那就意味着“它对企业有好处”。但游艇不同。 Neil(尼尔)Yachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a black hole of wealth.游艇，尤其是她所说的超级游艇，实际上是赔钱的。以至于她将超级游艇称为财富黑洞。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)A black hole, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape – not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money!从科学的角度来看，黑洞是一个引力如此强大以至于没有任何东西可以逃脱的地方 —— 即使是光。所以，从商业角度来说，黑洞会吃掉你所有的钱！ Neil(尼尔)It’s also used conversationally to mean ‘a place where things go missing’.它在会话中也用于表示“东西丢失的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)These superyachts are big. The world’s longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study – she used to work on the yachts.这些超级游艇很大。世界上最长的有 180 米长。他们需要专业的工作人员。这就是 Emma 开始学习的原因 —— 她曾经在游艇上工作。 Neil(尼尔)She’s now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich.她现在花了六年时间研究超级游艇和超级富豪的世界。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, what else did she learn?那么，她还学到了什么呢？ Neil(尼尔)She says that in the world of the super rich – the size of your yacht shows your place in the pecking order.她说，在超级富豪的世界里 —— 你的游艇的大小显示了你在啄食顺序中的位置。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)The pecking order means ‘the social system from most powerful to least powerful’.啄食顺序的意思是“从最强大到最不强大的社会制度”。 Neil(尼尔)If you’re higher up in the yachting pecking order, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently.如果您在游艇啄食顺序中排名靠前，您将获得港口中最好的位置。显然，这对游艇所有者来说非常重要。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Apparently, so. It’s all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. Now that’s another great term – conspicuous means ‘visible or noticeable’ and consumption means ‘spending’. So, the phrase conspicuous consumption refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money.显然，是的。这一切都与看到和被看到有关。你实际上可以说游艇是炫耀性消费的终极形式。这是另一个很棒的术语 —— conspicuous 的意思是“可见或引人注目”，consumption 的意思是“支出”。所以，炫耀性消费这个词指的是你做的那种购买，让别人注意到你的钱。 Neil(尼尔)Before we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today’s question.在我们驶向日落之前，凯瑟琳，我们来回答今天的问题怎么样。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years.我说过，越南是预计未来 10 年超级富豪比例增长最快的国家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I’m very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam – according to the same report by Knight Frank – the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade.嗯，我很高兴地说你是对的。事实上，根据莱坊 （Knight Frank） 的同一份报告，越南的超级富豪人口预计将在未来十年内增长 170%，令人震惊。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme?现在，我们再看看这个程序中的词汇财富怎么样？ Neil(尼尔)Very good. We started with assets – here it means ‘things we can buy or sell’. What are your assets?非常好。我们从资产开始 —— 这里的意思是“我们可以购买或出售的东西”。您的资产是什么？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Oh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I’m not like you though Neil, I don’t live in an expensive mansion – that would be a real status symbol!哦，你知道的，我的钻戒、我的自行车、我的笔记本电脑。我和你不一样，尼尔，我不住在昂贵的豪宅里 —— 那将是真正的身份象征！ Neil(尼尔)If only that were true, but it’s a good example. A status symbol is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society.如果这是真的就好了，但这是个好例子。身份象征是炫耀我们的财富和社会地位的财产。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, and we had the phrase to make business sense – in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense.是的，我们有一句话要有商业意义 —— 换句话说，对业务有利。我们也可以说某项特定政策具有经济意义。 Neil(尼尔)Or I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they’re a black hole for our money.或者我可以说明智地投资在财务上是有意义的。不像游艇，购买和运行成本很高。事实上，他们是我们资金的黑洞。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, did you know our next phrase, pecking order, actually comes from chicken behaviour?现在，您知道我们的下一个短语 Peking order 实际上来自鸡的行为吗？ Neil(尼尔)And finally, the phrase conspicuous consumption. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is conspicuous consumption.最后，短语 conspicuous consumption。例如，你可以说，在最好的餐厅穿着昂贵的衣服用餐是炫耀性消费。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And to clear up two similar phrases: a status symbol refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas conspicuous consumption refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you’re spending money so that other people notice.澄清两个类似的短语：身份象征是指物体本身，就像一辆豪华汽车；而炫耀性消费是指将钱花在昂贵的汽车等东西上的行为，但你花钱是为了让其他人注意到。 Neil(尼尔)Do check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.请在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上关注我们。 Neil &amp; Catherine(尼尔和凯瑟琳)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】assetsthings you can buy and sell资产你可以买卖的东西The company’s assets are valued at over $5 million.这家公司的资产估值超过500万美元。 status symbolsomething you own to show off your wealth and social position身份的象征你拥有的用来炫耀你的财富和社会地位的东西For many people, a large car is still a status symbol.对很多人来说，大汽车仍然是身份的象征。 to make business senseto be good for business具有商业意义对生意有好处The plan has to make business sense.这个计划必须具有商业意义。 black holesomewhere impossible to escape黑洞某处无法逃脱She felt as if she had fallen into a black hole of despair.她感觉好像掉进了一个绝望的黑洞。 pecking orderthe informal social system from most to least powerful等级制度从最有权势到最没权势的非正式社会系统There is a clearly defined pecking order within the company.公司内部存在着明确的等级制度。 conspicuous consumptionspending a lot of money so other people notice your wealth炫耀性消费花很多钱，这样别人就会注意到你的财富Conspicuous consumption is often associated with the newly rich.炫耀性消费通常与新富联系在一起。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】有人是从摩天大楼上坠落并幸存下来的？","path":"/2017/04/27/wechat-2017-04-27/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

DanWell, I recently heard a story about Alcides Moreno. NeilWho’s that? DanHe’s a window cleaner. He cleaned the windows on the sky scrapers in New York. Except one day, he fell. NeilOh my goodness. DanYes. And what’s more is. He survived. NeilWow! How far did he fall? DanAh, well, all will be revealed after this week’s question.

Well, I think it’s got to be b) 50% DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right or not later. So, do you want to hear the story? NeilOf course! DanWell, on the 7th of December, Ecuadorians Alcides Moreno, and his brother, Edgar, went up to the top of the Solow Tower in New York to clean the windows like they did every day. NeilAnd how tall is that building? DanIt’s 47 storeys. NeilAnd how did they usually clean it? DanWell, they used a scaffold, which is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape NeilAh, so in this case there was a platform which was attached by cables, or large metal ropes, and hung over the edge of the building and which the window cleaners could raise and lower. DanExactly. So, as usual they filled up their buckets and climbed on to the scaffold. NeilAnd. DanWell, unfortunately the cables were loose, and the scaffold fell from the building. Both brothers fell 47 storeys. NeilThat’s terrible! What happened next? DanI’ll let Jo Fidgen, presenter of the BBC show Outlook, explain Jo Fidgen – BBC Outlook presenterWhen firefighters arrived on the scene, they found a crowd of distraught onlookers pointing towards an alleyway. Edgar had landed on a fence and couldn’t be helped, but Alcides was found crouching in a pile of twisted metal still clutching the controls of the scaffold. He was breathing.even trying to stand up. NeilSo, firefighters arrived to find a group of distraught, which means extremely worried and upset, people showing them where the two men had come down. DanYes, and though, unfortunately, Edgar didn’t survive, Alcides was found clutching, or holding extremely tightly, to the controls of the scaffold. NeilDid I hear correctly that he was trying to stand up? Did he escape the accident unscathed? DanUnscathed means without any injury at all. And, no, he fell into a coma for 3 weeks and needed 24 pints of blood. NeilI’m speechless. I don’t understand how he lived. DanYou aren’t the only one. Listen to what Dr. Philip Barie, from New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said about the whole incident. Philip Barie, New York-Presbyterian HospitalI don’t know what adjective you’d care to use: unprecedented, extraordinary. if you are a believer in miracles, this would be one. NeilWow. So he can’t explain it either. He said it was unprecedented which means never happened or done before. DanYes, and he also said that this was a miracle, which is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. NeilI guess we’ll never know. But one thing I can know is the answer to this week’s question. DanAh, yes. I asked you what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys? a) 30% b) 50% c) 70% NeilAnd I said b) 50% DanAnd you were exactly right. Well done. NeilWow! It’s a first! DanShall we look at the vocabulary then? NeilFirst we had a near-death experience, which is an experience where a person very nearly, or could easily have died. Have you ever had one, Dan? DanWhen I was 14 I fell out of a canoe into a river and got stuck between the boat and a rock with my head underwater. I thought it was the end. But, some people pulled me out. Then we had scaffold. A scaffold is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape. Name a place that you might see scaffolding, Neil. NeilThey are usually put up around houses when builders are working on the roof. Then we had clutching. If you clutch something, it means you hold it extremely tightly. There is a well-known idiom that uses this word. Sound familiar, Dan? DanAh, you’re clutching at straws, Neil, which means you are trying to find a reason or hope to succeed when it’s extremely unlikely. What was after that? NeilAfter that we had unscathed. If you are unscathed, you are uninjured. We often talk about escaping something unscathed. Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed? DanWell, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil? NeilNeil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969. And, finally, we had miracle. A miracle is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. The adjectives is miraculous. Do you believe in miracles, Dan? DanWell, I’ve never seen or experienced one, but when you hear a story like this, it’s difficult not to. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!

I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil?好吧，当我 6 岁时，我掉进了一些建筑商在进行翻新时挖的一个洞。我在车库里撞到了地，但不知何故我毫发无损地逃脱了。也许，我反弹了？然后我们听到了前所未有的声音。如果某件事是前所未有的，那么它以前从未发生过或做过。Neil，你能想出一个例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969.

I’m Dan. And today we’re talking about… CatherineSighing. I’m Catherine. DanNow – was that a real sigh – or just one to demonstrate the meaning? CatherineThat one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan. DanWe’ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive! CatherineYes, very interesting. And it’s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan? DanIndeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today’s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it? a) Twice b) 10 times c) 40 times CatherineI’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour DanOK. Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly? CatherineLet’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK. Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam UniversityIt’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of resetting mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism. CatherineSo sighing keeps us alive. DanDr Barker called it a survival mechanism. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A mechanism, here, means a system of behaviour. CatherineSo, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism? DanIt’s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone. CatherineOK, that’s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs? DanWell, scientists from UCLA, that’s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly. CatherineAnd without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood. DanThankfully, we don’t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex. CatherineBoo! DanArgh! CatherineThere – you jumped! And that was a fabulous reflex, Dan! It’s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically. DanI meant like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine. CatherineYou’re welcome. DanDo you sigh a lot? CatherineWell, I sigh when I’m tired, and I sigh when I’m relieved. I breathe a sigh of relief. DanTo breathe a sigh of relief – that’s a great expression. It means what you think it means – to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened – but it’s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing. CatherineThat’s right. Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I’d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan? DanI tend to sigh to show frustration. And sometimes resignation. CatherineNow, frustration is what we feel when things aren’t going well, when things are annoying us and they don’t work. When things are frustrating. DanAnd resignation is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can’t change. We feel resigned to something. CatherineSo, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing! DanWell, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about. mice? CatherineWell, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour. DanWell, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster – so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans. CatherineLet’s review today’s vocabulary. DanWe had the phrase survival mechanism. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive. CatherineWe often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life. DanNext, we had reset. You can reset a computer, or a machine – to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again. CatherineAnd you can reset a password – this is a little bit different. It means to set – or choose - a new password. DanWe also had the word reflex. This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control. For example. Catherine? CatherineYes? DanThere, you closed your eyes. Another reflex. CatherineAnd we had to breathe a sigh to relief. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness. DanBut we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: frustration and resignation. CatherineFrustration is the state of being frustrated. We can say something is frustrating. It’s frustrating when my boss doesn’t listen to me. DanBut let’s say you move beyond feeling frustrated and start feeling resigned. CatherineYeah, and that would be when I finally accept my boss will never listen to me. And that’s when I’ll resign! DanTo resign also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that’s just another vocabulary example? CatherineOf course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?! DanWhich is perfectly average. And that’s it for today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. CatherineAnd we are on social media too. Make sure to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Dan. And today we’re talking about…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Dan。今天我们讨论的是…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sighing. I’m Catherine.叹息。我是 Catherine。 Dan(担)Now – was that a real sigh – or just one to demonstrate the meaning?现在 —— 这是真的叹息 —— 还是只是为了证明它的含义？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan.那只是为了教育目的，当然，Dan。 Dan(担)We’ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive!我们将看看我们为什么叹息，并了解叹息如何让我们活着！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, very interesting. And it’s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan?是的，非常有趣。叹息的不仅仅是人类，不是吗，Dan？ Dan(担)Indeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today’s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it? a) Twice b) 10 times c) 40 times事实上，大多数哺乳动物都会叹息。这就引出了我今天的问题。老鼠平均一小时会叹气多少次？是吗？a） 2 次 b） 10 次 c） 40 次 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour我要说这个可怜的小家伙每小时会叹气大约 40 次 Dan(担)OK. Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly?还行。让我们看看您在该计划的后面是否正确。那么，究竟什么是叹息呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.让我们听听英国谢菲尔德哈勒姆大学的认知神经科学家 Lynne Barker 博士的演讲。 Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University(谢菲尔德哈勒姆大学认知神经科学家LynneBarker博士)It’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of resetting mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism.这是一种典型的心肺重置机制，大多数哺乳动物都会进行某种形式的叹息。因为不叹息的人最终会死去。它是一种生存机制。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So sighing keeps us alive.所以叹息让我们活着。 Dan(担)Dr Barker called it a survival mechanism. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A mechanism, here, means a system of behaviour.巴克博士称其为一种生存机制。生存意味着继续生活，尤其是在困难的环境中。在这里，机制是指行为系统。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism?因此，生存机制是身体为了生存而自动做的事情。但是，Dan，为什么叹息是一种生存机制呢？ Dan(担)It’s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone.这是因为叹息可以重置肺部。To reset 是将某些内容恢复到其原始设置。我们在谈论技术时经常使用这个动词。您可以重置计算机或手机。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK, that’s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs?好的，没关系。但是，一声叹息是如何使肺重置的呢？ Dan(担)Well, scientists from UCLA, that’s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly.加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）的科学家们发现，叹息是一种特殊的深呼吸，可以保持我们肺部的微小空气囊（称为肺泡）正常工作。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.如果不叹息，这些肺泡就会塌陷，我们就会死去。我们需要肺泡将氧气从肺部转移到血液中。 Dan(担)Thankfully, we don’t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex.值得庆幸的是，我们不必考虑重置肺部的需要。叹息实际上是一种条件反射。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Boo!喝倒彩！ Dan(担)Argh!啊！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)There – you jumped! And that was a fabulous reflex, Dan! It’s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically.你跳了！这真是一个美妙的反应，丹！这是我们的身体不假思索地做的事情，是你无意识或自动做的事情。 Dan(担)I meant like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine.我是说像个男人。谢谢你，凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re welcome.别客气。 Dan(担)Do you sigh a lot?你是不是经常叹息？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I sigh when I’m tired, and I sigh when I’m relieved. I breathe a sigh of relief.嗯，累了就叹气，松了一口气就叹。我松了一口气。 Dan(担)To breathe a sigh of relief – that’s a great expression. It means what you think it means – to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened – but it’s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing.松一口气 – 这是一个很好的表达。它的意思是你认为的意思 —— 当你感觉良好时叹息，因为坏事没有发生 —— 但它经常被用来比喻。它更多地与解脱的感觉有关，而不是叹息的行为。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I’d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan?没错。现在，当我前几天找到我的手机时，我松了一口气。我以为我已经失去了它。它是新的。当我找到它时，我非常高兴！丹，你呢？ Dan(担)I tend to sigh to show frustration. And sometimes resignation.我倾向于叹息以表示沮丧。有时是无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, frustration is what we feel when things aren’t going well, when things are annoying us and they don’t work. When things are frustrating.现在，当事情进展不顺利时，当事情让我们烦恼并且它们不起作用时，我们会感到沮丧。当事情令人沮丧时。 Dan(担)And resignation is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can’t change. We feel resigned to something.而顺从是当我们最终接受发生了我们无法改变的坏事时的感觉。我们对某些事情感到无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!所以，解脱、顺从、沮丧、重置我们的肺。听起来我们人类从来没有停止过叹息！ Dan(担)Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about. mice?嗯，实际上，我们人类平均每小时叹息 12 次。但是呢。小 鼠？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.嗯，我说，我估计他们每小时大约叹气 40 次。 Dan(担)Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster – so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.嗯，事实上，它是每小时 40 次。老鼠的心脏跳动得更快 —— 因此它们比人类更需要调节自己的肺部。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s review today’s vocabulary.让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Dan(担)We had the phrase survival mechanism. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.我们有 survival mechanism 这个词。我们不假思索地做的事情让我们活着。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)We often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.在谈论人们如何应对生活中的困难时，我们经常使用这个短语以及相关的短语 defence mechanism。 Dan(担)Next, we had reset. You can reset a computer, or a machine – to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again.接下来，我们重置了。您可以重置计算机或机器 – 使其再次工作。这通常意味着将其关闭并重新打开。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And you can reset a password – this is a little bit different. It means to set – or choose - a new password.您可以重置密码 – 这有点不同。这意味着设置或选择 - 新密码。 Dan(担)We also had the word reflex. This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control. For example. Catherine?我们还有 reflex 这个词。这是您无法控制的身体动作或反应。例如。凯瑟 琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes?是的？ Dan(担)There, you closed your eyes. Another reflex.在那里，你闭上了眼睛。又一次反射。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we had to breathe a sigh to relief. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.我们不得不松一口气。这意味着在坏事没有发生后感觉更好。当我的朋友从病中康复时，我松了一口气。 Dan(担)But we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: frustration and resignation.但我们也会因为其他原因而叹息。两个有用的叹息词是：沮丧和无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Frustration is the state of being frustrated. We can say something is frustrating. It’s frustrating when my boss doesn’t listen to me.挫折是沮丧的状态。我们可以说有些事情令人沮丧。当我的老板不听我的话时，这很令人沮丧。 Dan(担)But let’s say you move beyond feeling frustrated and start feeling resigned.但是，假设您不再感到沮丧，开始感到无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yeah, and that would be when I finally accept my boss will never listen to me. And that’s when I’ll resign!是的，那时我终于接受了我的老板永远不会听我的话。那时我就要辞职了！ Dan(担)To resign also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that’s just another vocabulary example?To resigning 也意味着自愿离职！请问，Catherine，请告诉我这只是另一个词汇示例？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Of course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?!当然是，丹。我热爱我的工作！我只叹气，什么，每小时 12 次？！ Dan(担)Which is perfectly average. And that’s it for today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon.这是完全平均的。这就是今天的六分钟 English 内容。请尽快再次加入我们。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we are on social media too.

I’m Neil. Today we’re talking about jobs. DanAnd I’m Dan. And specifically, we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job… NeilYes. On that note – Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer? DanI wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you? NeilThat doesn’t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call portfolio careers these days – so they can do a bit of everything. DanA portfolio, as a noun, means ‘a case for carrying large pictures’ – or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things – in this case, careers. NeilIndeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a portfolio career. DanSounds like a good combination. First, let’s do today’s question – it’s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as… bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it: a) Farmers b) Spies c) Guards NeilIt can’t be spies, can it? So I’m going to guess guards. C. DanGreat, well let’s find out at the end of the programme. NeilNow, the portfolio career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up. DanWhich specific example of a portfolio career does she mention? Emily Wapnick, AuthorMore and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs and it’s not just to make ends meet. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They’ve got, you know, three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they’re a serial entrepreneur. Or they’ve got a career in two different areas. There’s a guy I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier – he makes violins – and he’s very successful in both. NeilEmily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier – someone who makes violins. DanShe says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet – in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression – a serial entrepreneur – what’s that exactly? NeilWell, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses – and the use of serial here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity – such as a serial killer or serial murderer. DanNot the kind of portfolio career I had in mind. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business. NeilAnother thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast – it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it’s wise to add another string to your bow. DanA great phrase, which really just means ‘to learn new skills you can use in the future’. I’d like to learn Japanese – that would add another string to my bow. NeilSo desu, ne? But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money. DanHere’s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place. Charles Handy, Writer80% of the people in corporate jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you’re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they’re not making an awful lot of money. It’s a balancing job really, you’re free but you’re poor. Or you’re slaved but you’re richer. NeilSounds like a difficult choice – be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan? DanI’d rather be poor and free, thank you very much. NeilWell, let’s explain a term he used – a corporate job. What does corporate mean? DanQuite literally, it’s the adjective from the term corporation - a corporate job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation – usually well paid, and with certain benefits. NeilCould we say James Bond has a corporate career? DanYes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from? NeilAnd I said the Bonds were guards. DanI’m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years… The spying game came much later! NeilIndeed! Let’s spy today’s words once more. We had portfolio – which can be used in different ways. There’s a portfolio career, as well as the original meaning of a portfolio of art. Any others? DanYes, people talk about a portfolio of investments – if you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk. NeilTalking of money, we had to make ends meet. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to make ends meet – to make enough money to live on. DanThough having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a serial entrepreneur. Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime! NeilAnd an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses. DanI’d love to start a business… First, I need to learn a new skill - add another string to my bow and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business. NeilNot for me though, I prefer the corporate life – a secure job in a big corporation! DanOK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work! NeilAlright. DanAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. NeilAnd we are on social media of course. Make sure to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil. Today we’re talking about jobs.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。今天我们谈论的是就业。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan. And specifically, we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job…我是 Dan。具体来说，我们正在研究拥有多份工作的趋势…… Neil(尼尔)Yes. On that note – Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer?是的。关于这一点 - Dan，你小时候有没有问过这个问题？“你长大后想成为什么？”你还记得你的答案吗？ Dan(担)I wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you?我想成为忍者神龟。还有你？ Neil(尼尔)That doesn’t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call portfolio careers these days – so they can do a bit of everything.这并不让我感到惊讶。我想我想成为一名职业足球运动员。我想为英格兰效力。好吧，对许多人来说，这个问题随着年龄的增长而变得更加困难！这就是为什么现在越来越多的人拥有我们所谓的投资组合职业的原因之一 —— 这样他们就可以做任何事情。 Dan(担)A portfolio, as a noun, means ‘a case for carrying large pictures’ – or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things – in this case, careers.作品集作为名词，意思是“携带大照片的箱子” —— 或者它可以指照片本身的集合。但我们也将其用作形容词来描述某些事物的组 —— 在本例中，职业。 Neil(尼尔)Indeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a portfolio career.事实上，我们可以说兼职教师和兼职音乐家都有投资组合职业。 Dan(担)Sounds like a good combination. First, let’s do today’s question – it’s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as… bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it: a) Farmers b) Spies c) Guards听起来不错。首先，让我们来回答今天的问题 – 它与工作有关。许多英文姓氏最初来自职业。例如，贝克这个姓氏最初是给那些担任…面包 师！姓氏邦德（Bond）呢，比如双七（double-oh-seven）中的詹姆斯·邦德（James Bond）呢？这个姓氏是谁？是不是：a） 农民 b） 间谍 c） 守卫 Neil(尼尔)It can’t be spies, can it? So I’m going to guess guards. C.不可能是间谍，对吧？所以我要猜猜后卫。C. Dan(担)Great, well let’s find out at the end of the programme.太好了，让我们在节目结束时找出答案。 Neil(尼尔)Now, the portfolio career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up.现在，投资组合职业。艾米丽·瓦普尼克 （Emily Wapnick） 是加拿大作家，著有一本名为《如何成为一切：给那些（仍然）不知道自己长大后想成为什么的人的指南》的书。 Dan(担)Which specific example of a portfolio career does she mention?她提到了哪个投资组合职业的具体例子？ Emily Wapnick, Author(EmilyWapnick，作家)More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs and it’s not just to make ends meet. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They’ve got, you know, three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they’re a serial entrepreneur. Or they’ve got a career in two different areas. There’s a guy I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier – he makes violins – and he’s very successful in both.越来越多的人从事多种事情和多种工作，这不仅仅是为了维持生计。很多人都在选择这种生活方式。你知道，他们有三家不同的企业正在蓬勃发展。或者他们是一个连续创业者。或者他们在两个不同的领域都有职业生涯。我提到有一个人，他是一名心理治疗师和制琴师 —— 他制作小提琴 —— 他在这两方面都非常成功。 Neil(尼尔)Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier – someone who makes violins.Emily 显然是这种工作的粉丝。她说她认识一个既是心理治疗师又是制琴师的男人 —— 一个制作小提琴的人。 Dan(担)She says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet – in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression – a serial entrepreneur – what’s that exactly?她说，这种趋势不仅仅是为了维持生计而工作 —— 换句话说，努力赚到足够的钱来生活。她还用了另一个有趣的表达方式 —— a serial entrepreneur —— 那到底是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses – and the use of serial here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity – such as a serial killer or serial murderer.嗯，企业家是创办和经营企业的人 —— 在这里使用 serial 作为形容词来描述一次又一次地做同样事情的人。虽然我们应该说，这个形容词更常用于犯罪活动 —— 例如连环杀手或连环杀人犯。 Dan(担)Not the kind of portfolio career I had in mind. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business.不是我心目中的那种投资组合职业。另一方面，连续创业者一个接一个地开始和经营企业。 Neil(尼尔)Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast – it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it’s wise to add another string to your bow.另一件事，因为 Emily 相信工作世界正在快速变化 —— 能够做不止一件事是明智的。换句话说，在你的弓上再加一根弦是明智的。 Dan(担)A great phrase, which really just means ‘to learn new skills you can use in the future’. I’d like to learn Japanese – that would add another string to my bow.一个很棒的短语，它真的只是意味着“学习你将来可以使用的新技能”。我想学习日语 - 这将为我的弓增加另一根弦。 Neil(尼尔)So desu, ne? But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money.所以 desu，ne？但当然，选择投资组合职业并不适合所有人。这通常简单地归结为金钱。 Dan(担)Here’s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place.这是作家和哲学家查尔斯·汉迪 （Charles Handy），也是最早推广投资组合职业一词的人。 Charles Handy, Writer(CharlesHandy，作家)80% of the people in corporate jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you’re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they’re not making an awful lot of money. It’s a balancing job really, you’re free but you’re poor. Or you’re slaved but you’re richer.80% 的公司工作人员讨厌他们，或者对他们不满意。而如果你在做自己的事情，他们中的 80% 真的很喜欢自由和创业精神，即使他们赚的钱不多。这真的是一项平衡的工作，你很自由，但你很穷。或者你是奴隶，但你更富有。 Neil(尼尔)Sounds like a difficult choice – be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan?听起来像是一个艰难的选择 —— 要么贫穷，要么成为奴隶。你会选择什么，丹？ Dan(担)I’d rather be poor and free, thank you very much.我宁愿贫穷自由，非常感谢。 Neil(尼尔)Well, let’s explain a term he used – a corporate job. What does corporate mean?好吧，让我们解释一下他用的一个术语 —— 公司工作。公司是什么意思？ Dan(担)Quite literally, it’s the adjective from the term corporation - a corporate job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation – usually well paid, and with certain benefits.从字面上看，它是来自公司一词的形容词 - 公司工作是在大公司、公司或组织的工作 - 通常薪水很高，并有一定的福利。 Neil(尼尔)Could we say James Bond has a corporate career?我们能说詹姆斯·邦德有企业生涯吗？ Dan(担)Yes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?是的，我想是的！谢谢你提醒我回答今天的问题：邦德这个姓氏来自哪个职业？ Neil(尼尔)And I said the Bonds were guards.我说邦德夫妇是守卫。 Dan(担)I’m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years… The spying game came much later!恐怕你错了。邦德最初是农民，他们必须为特定的领主工作。这个词可以追溯到 1000 多年前……间谍游戏来得晚得多！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed! Let’s spy today’s words once more. We had portfolio – which can be used in different ways. There’s a portfolio career, as well as the original meaning of a portfolio of art. Any others?事实上！让我们再次窥探今天的文字。我们有投资组合 – 可以以不同的方式使用。有一个作品集职业，以及艺术作品集的原意。还有其他的吗？ Dan(担)Yes, people talk about a portfolio of investments – if you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.是的，人们谈论的是投资组合 —— 如果您同时投资几家公司以降低风险。 Neil(尼尔)Talking of money, we had to make ends meet. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to make ends meet – to make enough money to live on.说到钱，我们不得不维持生计。人们经常做一些不同的兼职工作来维持生计 —— 赚到足够的钱来维持生活。 Dan(担)Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a serial entrepreneur. Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime!虽然有很多兼职工作与成为连续创业者不同。Serial 意味着反复做某事，通常是犯罪！ Neil(尼尔)And an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses.企业家是创办和经营企业的人。 Dan(担)I’d love to start a business… First, I need to learn a new skill - add another string to my bow and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business.我很想创业…首先，我需要学习一项新技能 - 在我的弓上再加一根弦，学习瑜伽。然后也许有一天我会经营一家瑜伽生意。 Neil(尼尔)Not for me though, I prefer the corporate life – a secure job in a big corporation!但对我来说不是，我更喜欢公司生活 —— 在大公司找到一份稳定的工作！ Dan(担)OK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work!好的，但下班后你可以来参加我的瑜伽课！ Neil(尼尔)Alright.好。 Dan(担)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

NeilAbsolutely, the so-called ‘good’ bacteria do! We’ll get to that, but first we’ll look at today’s question. How many bacteria are there in the human body? a) 39 million b) 39 billion c) 39 trillion DanThey are pretty small. I’m going to go for c) 39 trillion. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right… by counting them one by one. DanThat’s going to take longer than six minutes! NeilYes it is, so let’s get moving! Scientists believe your mental state is connected to the bacteria in your gut. DanMy gut - my stomach and the other organs my food passes through… NeilYes. Researchers at McMaster University in Canada and University College Cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria help reduce anxiety in mice… DanAnxiety – the state of being worried or anxious. I don’t like the sound of an anxious mouse. NeilWell I’m afraid there’s another mouse experiment coming up. Researchers at Kyushu University found germ-free mice showed more stress… DanGerms – a general word for bacteria and microorganisms, usually the ones which cause disease… So germs help reduce stress and anxiety in mice. Any research on humans? NeilThe BBC TV programme Trust me, I’m a Doctor has just explored this. They looked at foods which are high in ‘good’ bacteria – a claim which more and more food products are making these days. DanYes, it’s a phrase that appears a lot in marketing. NeilBut many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well. They found that homemade fermented food was best. DanSo things like miso soup, kimchi, yoghurt, sauerkraut – all these are fermented. Have you tried all of those? NeilI love miso soup and kimchi. And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol. DanFermented foods are full of lots of good bacteria for your gut… Anything else from the BBC programme? NeilWell, this is the man behind the BBC study, Dr Michael Mosley. In this clip, a radio presenter asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy. PresenterWhat’s the good mood food? What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up? Dr Michael MosleyMediterranean diet. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for the brain; whole grains; lots of fruits and vegetables. Sugar: terrible for you. PresenterNot chocolate eclairs then? Dr Michael MosleySadly not. That will make you feel good for about 30 seconds until you finish it and then you feel terribly guilty. PresenterRight, ok. Mediterranean it is. DanHe said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean diet. Now, a diet can mean ‘an eating plan designed to help you lose weight’. NeilBut that’s not what it means here. Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people – in this case, the people living around the Mediterranean Sea. DanLots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables. And of course, add in plenty of fermented food too. NeilAnd don’t eat too many fatty, sugary, chocolaty things like chocolate eclairs – those are buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate. It’s really not rocket science, is it? DanEating healthily is pretty straightforward, even if the science behind it is complex. When you say something is not rocket science, you mean ‘it’s not difficult to understand’. NeilNow, are you ready for some counting? DanAh yes, you wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body! I said 39 trillion. NeilAnd you were right. The number goes up and down, but on average we’re thought to have around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body, according to the Weizmann Institute in Israel. The interesting thing is they think that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body. DanSo there’s more bacteria than human in me? NeilWell, maybe just you, Dan! Now, before the bacteria take over completely, let’s look over today’s words one more time. DanGut was first. It means ‘the stomach and other organs which digest our food’. But here’s an extra tip - the word can also mean ‘bravery’ when used in the plural. You’ve got guts, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office! NeilWhy thank you. Maybe I don’t feel any anxiety about how I look! Anxiety was our second word, and it means ‘fear or worry’. The adjective is anxious. DanYou know what makes me anxious? Germs. I wash my hands fifty times a day. I can’t stand the idea of getting ill from all the germs around here. NeilYes, germs are tiny organisms, and usually refers to those which carry disease. But as we heard, certain germs are good for you! DanEspecially those which are in fermented food. That’s food which has gone through a process where sugars turn into acids and alcohol. They often taste sour or bitter. NeilWe also talk about fermenting alcoholic drinks. Beer and wine are fermented. DanDoes that mean I should make them a part of my diet? A diet not only means ‘a healthy eating plan’, but can also mean ‘the foods and drinks consumed by an individual or group’. Which country has the best diet, Neil? NeilWell, in my opinion the Japanese diet. It’s my favourite anyway – very varied and plenty of fermented food! DanAnd finally we had – it’s not rocket science – it’s simple to understand. An example? NeilBrewing beer isn’t rocket science – you just need hops, yeast and patience. DanAnd there we are – a rocket speed review of today’s words! And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. NeilAnd we are on social media too. Make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six items of incredibly useful vocabulary. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个非常有用的词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Now, a favourite topic today: food, and how food can influence your mood. Dan, tell me, what food makes you happy?我是 Neil。现在，今天最喜欢的话题是：食物，以及食物如何影响您的情绪。Dan，告诉我，什么食物让你快乐？ Dan(担)Oh, you know, ice cream, chocolate… chocolate always puts a smile on my face.哦，你知道的，冰淇淋、巧克力……巧克力总是让我脸上露出笑容。 Neil(尼尔)And a few inches round your waistline! Sadly, the research we’ll be looking at today doesn’t suggest you eat more chocolate… but it does talk about bacteria!还有几英寸的腰围！遗憾的是，我们今天要看的研究并不建议你多吃巧克力……但它确实谈到了细菌！ Dan(担)Bacteria – those simple, small organisms – they make me happy?细菌 – 那些简单的小生物 – 它们让我快乐吗？ Neil(尼尔)Absolutely, the so-called ‘good’ bacteria do! We’ll get to that, but first we’ll look at today’s question. How many bacteria are there in the human body? a) 39 million b) 39 billion c) 39 trillion绝对，所谓的“好”细菌确实如此！我们稍后会谈到这个问题，但首先我们要看看今天的问题。人体有多少细菌？a） 3900 万 b） 390 亿 c） 39 万亿 Dan(担)They are pretty small. I’m going to go for c) 39 trillion.它们很小。我打算选择 c） 39 万亿。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… by counting them one by one.好吧，我们会找出你是对的吗……通过一一数数。 Dan(担)That’s going to take longer than six minutes!这将花费超过六分钟的时间！ Neil(尼尔)Yes it is, so let’s get moving! Scientists believe your mental state is connected to the bacteria in your gut.是的，所以让我们开始吧！科学家认为，您的精神状态与肠道中的细菌有关。 Dan(担)My gut - my stomach and the other organs my food passes through…我的肠道 - 我的胃和我食物经过的其他器官…… Neil(尼尔)Yes. Researchers at McMaster University in Canada and University College Cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria help reduce anxiety in mice…是的。加拿大麦克马斯特大学和爱尔兰科克大学的研究人员发现，某些细菌有助于减轻小鼠的焦虑…… Dan(担)Anxiety – the state of being worried or anxious. I don’t like the sound of an anxious mouse.焦虑 – 担心或焦虑的状态。我不喜欢焦虑的老鼠的声音。 Neil(尼尔)Well I’m afraid there’s another mouse experiment coming up. Researchers at Kyushu University found germ-free mice showed more stress…嗯，恐怕还有另一个老鼠实验即将到来。九州大学的研究人员发现，无菌小鼠表现出更大的压力…… Dan(担)Germs – a general word for bacteria and microorganisms, usually the ones which cause disease… So germs help reduce stress and anxiety in mice. Any research on humans?病菌 – 细菌和微生物的通用词，通常是导致疾病的细菌和微生物……因此，细菌有助于减轻小鼠的压力和焦虑。有没有关于人类的研究？ Neil(尼尔)The BBC TV programme Trust me, I’m a Doctor has just explored this. They looked at foods which are high in ‘good’ bacteria – a claim which more and more food products are making these days.BBC 电视节目 相信我，我是医生 刚刚探讨了这个问题。他们研究了富含“有益”细菌的食物 —— 如今越来越多的食品正在提出这一说法。 Dan(担)Yes, it’s a phrase that appears a lot in marketing.是的，这是营销中经常出现的短语。 Neil(尼尔)But many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well. They found that homemade fermented food was best.但许多传统食品的有益细菌含量也很高。他们发现自制发酵食品是最好的。 Dan(担)So things like miso soup, kimchi, yoghurt, sauerkraut – all these are fermented. Have you tried all of those?所以像味噌汤、辛奇、酸奶、酸菜这样的东西 —— 所有这些都是发酵的。你试过所有这些吗？ Neil(尼尔)I love miso soup and kimchi. And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol.我喜欢味噌汤和辛奇。发酵是食物中的糖分转化为酸和酒精的过程。 Dan(担)Fermented foods are full of lots of good bacteria for your gut… Anything else from the BBC programme?发酵食品中含有大量对肠道有益的细菌……BBC 节目还有什么其他内容吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, this is the man behind the BBC study, Dr Michael Mosley. In this clip, a radio presenter asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy.嗯，这就是 BBC 研究的幕后推手，迈克尔·莫斯利博士。在这个剪辑中，一位电台主持人问他最好的食物是什么才能让我们快乐。 Presenter(主持人)What’s the good mood food? What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up?什么是好心情食物？我们现在该吃什么来振作起来呢？ Dr Michael Mosley(MichaelMosley医生)Mediterranean diet. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for the brain; whole grains; lots of fruits and vegetables. Sugar: terrible for you.地中海饮食。橄榄油；油性鱼，富含 Omega 3，对大脑真的很好；全谷物；大量的水果和蔬菜。糖：对你来说很糟糕。 Presenter(主持人)Not chocolate eclairs then?那不是巧克力泡芙吗？ Dr Michael Mosley(MichaelMosley医生)Sadly not. That will make you feel good for about 30 seconds until you finish it and then you feel terribly guilty.遗憾的是没有。这会让你感觉良好大约 30 秒，直到你完成它，然后你会感到非常内疚。 Presenter(主持人)Right, ok. Mediterranean it is.对，好的。它是地中海的。 Dan(担)He said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean diet. Now, a diet can mean ‘an eating plan designed to help you lose weight’.他说，最好的食物是地中海饮食。现在，节食可以意味着“旨在帮助您减肥的饮食计划”。 Neil(尼尔)But that’s not what it means here. Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people – in this case, the people living around the Mediterranean Sea.但这不是它的意思。在这里，它指的是一群人吃的食物和饮料 —— 在这种情况下，是生活在地中海周围的人们。 Dan(担)Lots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables. And of course, add in plenty of fermented food too.很多油性鱼、橄榄油、谷物、水果和蔬菜。当然，也要加入大量的发酵食品。 Neil(尼尔)And don’t eat too many fatty, sugary, chocolaty things like chocolate eclairs – those are buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate. It’s really not rocket science, is it?不要吃太多高脂肪、含糖、巧克力等巧克力类的东西 —— 那些是装满奶油并覆盖着巧克力的面包。这真的不是火箭科学，不是吗？ Dan(担)Eating healthily is pretty straightforward, even if the science behind it is complex. When you say something is not rocket science, you mean ‘it’s not difficult to understand’.健康饮食非常简单，即使其背后的科学很复杂。当你说某件事不是火箭科学时，你的意思是“它不难理解”。 Neil(尼尔)Now, are you ready for some counting?现在，您准备好进行一些计数了吗？ Dan(担)Ah yes, you wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body! I said 39 trillion.啊，是的，你要我数一数我体内所有的细菌！我说的是 39 万亿。 Neil(尼尔)And you were right. The number goes up and down, but on average we’re thought to have around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body, according to the Weizmann Institute in Israel. The interesting thing is they think that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body.你是对的。这个数字有起有落，但根据以色列魏茨曼研究所的数据，平均而言，我们体内大约有 39 万亿个细菌细胞。有趣的是，他们认为体内只有 30 万亿个人体细胞。 Dan(担)So there’s more bacteria than human in me?所以我体内的细菌比人类还多？ Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe just you, Dan! Now, before the bacteria take over completely, let’s look over today’s words one more time.好吧，也许就你一个人，丹！现在，在细菌完全接管之前，让我们再看一遍今天的文字。 Dan(担)Gut was first. It means ‘the stomach and other organs which digest our food’. But here’s an extra tip - the word can also mean ‘bravery’ when used in the plural. You’ve got guts, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office!肠道是第一位的。它的意思是“胃和其他消化我们食物的器官”。但这里有一个额外的提示 - 这个词在复数形式中使用时也可以表示“勇敢”。你有胆量，Neil，在这个办公室里穿着那件疯狂的衬衫！ Neil(尼尔)Why thank you. Maybe I don’t feel any anxiety about how I look! Anxiety was our second word, and it means ‘fear or worry’. The adjective is anxious.为什么谢谢你。也许我对自己的外表没有任何焦虑！焦虑是我们的第二个词，它的意思是“恐惧或担忧”。形容词是焦虑的。 Dan(担)You know what makes me anxious? Germs. I wash my hands fifty times a day. I can’t stand the idea of getting ill from all the germs around here.你知道是什么让我焦虑吗？病菌。我每天洗手 50 次。我无法忍受这里的所有病菌会生病。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, germs are tiny organisms, and usually refers to those which carry disease. But as we heard, certain germs are good for you!是的，病菌是微小的生物体，通常是指携带疾病的生物。但正如我们听说的那样，某些细菌对您有好处！ Dan(担)Especially those which are in fermented food. That’s food which has gone through a process where sugars turn into acids and alcohol. They often taste sour or bitter.尤其是那些在发酵食品中的。那是经历了糖转化为酸和酒精的过程的食物。它们通常尝起来是酸的或苦的。 Neil(尼尔)We also talk about fermenting alcoholic drinks. Beer and wine are fermented.我们还讨论了发酵酒精饮料。啤酒和葡萄酒经过发酵。 Dan(担)Does that mean I should make them a part of my diet? A diet not only means ‘a healthy eating plan’, but can also mean ‘the foods and drinks consumed by an individual or group’. Which country has the best diet, Neil?这是否意味着我应该将它们作为我饮食的一部分？节食不仅意味着“健康的饮食计划”，还可以意味着“个人或群体食用的食物和饮料”。尼尔，哪个国家的饮食最好？ Neil(尼尔)Well, in my opinion the Japanese diet. It’s my favourite anyway – very varied and plenty of fermented food!嗯，在我看来是日本的饮食。无论如何，这是我最喜欢的 - 种类繁多且发酵食品丰富！ Dan(担)And finally we had – it’s not rocket science – it’s simple to understand. An example?最后，我们有了 - 这不是火箭科学 - 它很容易理解。一个例子？ Neil(尼尔)Brewing beer isn’t rocket science – you just need hops, yeast and patience.酿造啤酒不是火箭科学 —— 你只需要啤酒花、酵母和耐心。 Dan(担)And there we are – a rocket speed review of today’s words!

I’m Dan. NeilAnd I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection. DanEverything ok, Neil? NeilI am so tired. One of my children is as sick as a dog. I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them. DanAs sick as a dog is an expression meaning ‘very ill’. I’m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can. NeilDon’t worry. There’s life in this old dog yet. DanGood. It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer. NeilAmazing. Any success? DanLet me ask you in this week’s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? Is it a) 50% b) 70% c) 90% NeilI’m going to guess a) 50% DanWe’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think? NeilA wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man’s best friend? But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable? DanWell, I’ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one. Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection DogsAlthough the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated bio- sensor. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been screened by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health? DanSo, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a bio-sensor, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Neil Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to screen, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs. DanYep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans? NeilWell, there’s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger. DanNice. Any more? Maybe around the home? NeilAre you referring to guard dogs, meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.’ DanYep. Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger deterrent, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system. NeilOh and there’s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes. DanExactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them. NeilDo you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time biosensors then? DanWell, I don’t know, but here’s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter. Jeremy Hunt, Health SecretaryOne of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully. DanHe mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let’s hope so. NeilYes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to. DanOh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? a) 50% b) 70% c) 90% NeilAnd I said 50% DanIt’s a dog’s life, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer was c) 90% NeilWow! 90%! That’s amazing. DanIsn’t it? NeilShall we go through the vocabulary? DanOK. The first expression we had was as sick as a dog. If you are as sick as a dog it means that you’re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were as sick as a dog, Neil? NeilJust after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was as sick as a dog. Next we had paws. Paws are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan? DanWell, dogs have paws. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After paws, we had biosensor. A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil? NeilWell, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic. Then we had screen. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport – where they would screen for explosives. How else can it be used, Dan? DanWell, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was deterrent. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil? NeilThat’s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart. DanGood idea! NeilFinally, we heard orthodoxies. An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective isorthodox and we often hear its opposite word – unorthodox, meaning unusual. Do you do anythingunorthodox, Dan? DanWell I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It’s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try! NeilI don’t blame them! Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! DanAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.我是 Neil。我们将讨论用于癌症检测的狗。 Dan(担)Everything ok, Neil?一切都还好吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)I am so tired. One of my children is as sick as a dog. I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them.我好累。我的一个孩子病得像狗一样。我整晚都没有睡觉照顾他们。 Dan(担)As sick as a dog is an expression meaning ‘very ill’. I’m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can.As sick as a dog 是一个表达，意思是“病得很重”。听到这个消息，我感到很遗憾。如果可以的话，试着坚持下去。 Neil(尼尔)Don’t worry. There’s life in this old dog yet.不用担心。这只老狗还有生命。 Dan(担)Good. It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.好。你提到狗很有趣，因为显然，英国国家卫生服务局目前正在评估狗是否可以用于检测早期前列腺癌。 Neil(尼尔)Amazing. Any success?了不起。成功了吗？ Dan(担)Let me ask you in this week’s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? Is it a) 50% b) 70% c) 90%让我在本周的问题中问你。在多大的病例中，狗能够检测到尿液中是否存在癌症？是 a） 50% b） 70% c） 90% Neil(尼尔)I’m going to guess a) 50%我猜 a） 50% Dan(担)We’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?我们稍后会知道你是对还是错。所以，尼尔，我说狗，你怎么看？ Neil(尼尔)A wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man’s best friend? But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable?湿漉漉的鼻子、四只爪子，也就是我们所说的某些动物的脚，蓬松的外套和摇晃的尾巴？人类最好的朋友？但我从来没有听说过癌症狗。我想知道是什么让它们适合？ Dan(担)Well, I’ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one.好吧，我让慈善机构 Medical Detection Dogs 的首席执行官 Claire Guest 博士来回答这个问题。 Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs(DrClaireGuest，MedicalDetectionDogs首席执行官)Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated bio- sensor. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been screened by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?虽然这只狗有蓬松的皮毛和摇晃的尾巴，但它实际上是一个高度复杂的生物传感器。你知道，进化赋予了他这个高度敏感的鼻子，可以精确到万亿分之几。人们每天登上经过搜查犬检查的飞机，看看机上是否有爆炸物。为什么我们在那里依赖他们，却不帮助我们保持健康？ Dan(担)So, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a bio-sensor, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Neil Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to screen, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs.因此，狗已经进化到具有高度发达的嗅觉，这使它们能够充当生物传感器，一种使用生物检测化学物质的传感器。Neil 是的，她提到人类有使用警犬进行安全检查或检查爆炸物和炸弹是否适合的历史。 Dan(担)Yep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?是的！你能想到其他什么地方用狗来支持人类吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, there’s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger.嗯，有导盲犬，或者北美众所周知的导盲犬。他们帮助盲人避免危险。 Dan(担)Nice. Any more? Maybe around the home?好。还有吗？也许在家里？ Neil(尼尔)Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.’您指的是护卫犬，意思是“保护房屋或地方免受入室盗窃、盗窃或非法侵入的狗”。 Dan(担)Yep. Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger deterrent, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system.是的。前窃贼经常说，它们比警报系统更具有威慑力，或者说有理由不做某事。 Neil(尼尔)Oh and there’s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes.哦，还有救援犬。他们接受过搜索和寻找雪崩或地震等自然灾害受害者的培训。 Dan(担)Exactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them.没错，狗非常适合人们可能被埋在地下或雪下的情况。人类看不到它们，但狗仍然可以闻到它们。 Neil(尼尔)Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time biosensors then?您认为我们的国家卫生服务局会将它们用作全职生物传感器吗？ Dan(担)Well, I don’t know, but here’s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter.嗯，我不知道，但以下是英国卫生大臣杰里米·亨特 （Jeremy Hunt） 对此事的看法。 Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary(卫生大臣JeremyHunt)One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully.作为国会议员，我们的工作之一有时就是质疑正统观念，所以如果这项研究是好的，那么我想了解它，我肯定会仔细研究它。 Dan(担)He mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let’s hope so.他提到，这种类型的研究违背了正统或普遍接受的做事方式。但他也提到他会仔细研究它。所以让我们希望如此。 Neil(尼尔)Yes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to.是的，我不介意有个狗医生！说到研究，有一个问题我需要知道答案。 Dan(担)Oh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? a) 50% b) 70% c) 90%哦，是的。我问你，在多大的病例中，狗能够检测到尿液中癌症的存在？a） 50% b） 70% c） 90% Neil(尼尔)And I said 50%我说 50% Dan(担)It’s a dog’s life, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer was c) 90%这是狗的生活，尼尔。对不起。答案是 c） 90% Neil(尼尔)Wow! 90%! That’s amazing.哇！90%!这太神奇了。 Dan(担)Isn’t it?不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)Shall we go through the vocabulary?我们应该浏览一下词汇吗？ Dan(担)OK. The first expression we had was as sick as a dog. If you are as sick as a dog it means that you’re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were as sick as a dog, Neil?还行。我们的第一个表情就像狗一样病恹恹的。如果你病得像狗一样，那就意味着你确实病得很重。尼尔，你上一次病得像狗是什么时候？ Neil(尼尔)Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was as sick as a dog. Next we had paws. Paws are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan?圣诞节刚过，我就从我的孩子们那里抓到了一只虫子。我病得像条狗一样。接下来我们有爪子。爪子是某些动物的脚。他们有垫子和爪子。Dan，您能给我们举几个例子吗？ Dan(担)Well, dogs have paws. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After paws, we had biosensor. A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?嗯，狗有爪子。猫、兔子、熊和老鼠也是如此。但不是马、羊或猪。他们有蹄子。在爪子之后，我们有生物传感器。生物传感器是 biology 和 sensor 这两个词的组合。它是一种使用生物来检测化学物质的传感器。尼尔，你能想到一个著名的历史例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic. Then we had screen. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport – where they would screen for explosives. How else can it be used, Dan?好吧，处于一种叫做甲烷的剧毒但看不见的气体危险中的矿工过去常常带着笼子里的金丝雀下矿井。如果金丝雀生病或死亡，他们知道空气有毒。然后我们有屏幕。如果您检查某样东西，则意味着您检查其适用性，例如行李通过机场 – 他们会在那里检查爆炸物。丹，它还能怎么用呢？ Dan(担)Well, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was deterrent. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil?好吧，如今，您可以在您的计算机上安装一个广告拦截器，它可以过滤掉那些烦人的弹出广告。我讨厌那些！在那之后是威慑力。威慑是阻止一个人做某事的事情，例如害怕犯罪受到惩罚。你怎么阻止你的孩子顽皮，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)That’s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart.这很简单。我只是威胁要从他们的贴纸图表中删除一个贴纸。 Dan(担)Good idea!好主意！ Neil(尼尔)Finally, we heard orthodoxies. An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective isorthodox and we often hear its opposite word – unorthodox, meaning unusual. Do you do anythingunorthodox, Dan?最后，我们听到了正统的说法。正统是一种普遍接受的做事方式。它的形容词是 orthodox，我们经常听到它的反词 – unorthodox，意思是不寻常。丹，你做了什么非正统的事情吗？ Dan(担)Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It’s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try!嗯，我喜欢将热香肠和冷香草冰淇淋混合在一起。好吃！但没有人会足够信任我去尝试！ Neil(尼尔)I don’t blame them! Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!我不怪他们！好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Dan(担)And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons. DanYou know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they’re not that new, either. NeilOh really? DanWell, that’s the perfect opportunity to ask this week’s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it? a) 1606 b) 1862 c) 1982 NeilIt must be 1982. I’ll go with c). DanWe’ll find out if you’re right or wrong later in the programme. NeilYou know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what’s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? DanGood point. Emoticons came first. They’re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard – usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon – two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a… NeilA smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails! DanWell, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It’s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles… NeilAh yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you’ll have to convince me – why do people use them so much? DanWell, let’s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code: Professor Vyv Evans, Author of ‘The Emoji Code’They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication. Increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face- to-face interaction. In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively. NeilOk so he used a very useful word - empathy. It means ‘the ability to show you understand someone else’s feelings’. Ok – tell me more Dan. DanYes – adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy – more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction – as he says. NeilInteraction, meaning ‘when people or things communicate with each other’. We can also interact with things like machines, computers and social media. DanYes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we’re talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues. NeilWow, that’s a lot. A cue is a signal that you need to do something. DanFor example, an actor goes on stage after their cue. NeilAnd non-verbal means ‘without using spoken language’. So, here in the studio there are lots of other non-verbal signals about how we’re feeling - non-verbal cues. For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan DanThere’s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let’s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer – how would you respond? NeilWell, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly? DanIf I followed it with a sad face emoji, then…? NeilThen I guess I’d know you hurt yourself. Poor you. DanBut if I followed it with a laughing emoji – the one with the tears coming out because I’m laughing so much? NeilThen I’d probably reply saying how stupid and clumsy you are! DanExactly – without adding the emoji – it’s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the non-verbal cue – like my facial expression. NeilBy the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy? Clumsy, means ‘physically awkward’ – someone who’s clumsy falls over a lot and drops things. Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren’t as new as I think? DanYes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982? NeilI said 1982. DanWell, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets. NeilLike a winking face? DanExactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error – or what we normally call a typo. NeilA typo – a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly. DanThe official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in digital a communication. NeilWow, so they’re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let’s round up with another look at today’s words. DanSure. The first word we had was empathy. Do you have a lot of empathy, Neil? NeilYes, I think I’m quite good at understanding other people’s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It’s important to empathise with your colleagues too. DanThat’s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction. NeilNicely done. If two people interact, it means they ‘communicate with each other and react to each other’. It’s a pretty broad term. DanWe could also talk about how the way children interact with the internet. NeilWay too much! Next up, we had non-verbal, meaning ‘without spoken language’. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan? DanNext word… that is my cue to say the next word – which is in fact – cue. A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a cue to attack. Or I could give you a cue to… sing a song? NeilNo thanks. I’ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like clumsy – meaning ‘physically awkward’. I’d have to say Dan, you’re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you’re not clumsy at all. DanThat’s what I thought until I broke my leg – after a clumsy opponent ran into me… NeilOuch. Finally – we had type. No hang on, that’s not right. It should say typo. A typo is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message. DanAlways check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! NeilAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons.我是 Neil。我们将讨论那些我们称之为表情符号和表情符号的小图形的兴起。 Dan(担)You know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they’re not that new, either.你知道，我认为表情符号是交流的重要工具。实际上，它们也不是那么新鲜。 Neil(尼尔)Oh really?真的？ Dan(担)Well, that’s the perfect opportunity to ask this week’s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it? a) 1606 b) 1862 c) 1982嗯，这是提出本周问题的绝佳机会。第一个表情符号是什么时候使用的？是吗？a） 1606 b） 1862 c） 1982 Neil(尼尔)It must be 1982. I’ll go with c).那一定是 1982 年。我选择 c）。 Dan(担)We’ll find out if you’re right or wrong later in the programme.我们将在稍后的计划中找出您的判断是对还是错。 Neil(尼尔)You know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what’s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?你知道，我认为在我们进一步讨论之前，我们应该澄清一件事：表情符号和表情符号有什么区别？ Dan(担)Good point. Emoticons came first. They’re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard – usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon – two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a…说得好。表情符号是第一位的。它们是使用键盘上的普通键制作的图像 - 通常是标点符号、字母和数字。例如，冒号 - 两个点 - 后跟右括号的曲线是… Neil(尼尔)A smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails!一张笑脸。你在太多的电子邮件中使用的东西！ Dan(担)Well, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It’s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles…嗯，谢谢！而表情符号是完全不同的东西。这是一个真实的图像。它可以是一张简单的黄色笑脸；或者像跳舞的女士一样的东西；甚至是一碗面条…… Neil(尼尔)Ah yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you’ll have to convince me – why do people use them so much?啊，是的，我们手机里的所有那些小图片。但你得说服我 —— 为什么人们这么频繁地使用它们？ Dan(担)Well, let’s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code:好吧，让我们听听 Vyv Evans 教授的话。他写了一本书，叫《表情符号代码》（The Emoji Code）： Professor Vyv Evans, Author of ‘The Emoji Code’(VyvEvans教授，《TheEmojiCode》的作者)They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication. Increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face- to-face interaction. In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively.它们使我们能够在数字通信中表达情感和同理心。我们越来越多地发现，数字通信正在取代面对面互动的某些方面。例如，在今天的英国，成年人平均每周花 22 小时上网。表情符号如此有趣的原因之一是它们确实使我们能够更有效地表达我们的情感自我。 Neil(尼尔)Ok so he used a very useful word - empathy. It means ‘the ability to show you understand someone else’s feelings’. Ok – tell me more Dan.好的，所以他用了一个非常有用的词 —— 同理心。它的意思是“表明你理解别人的感受的能力”。好的 - 告诉我更多 Dan。 Dan(担)Yes – adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy – more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction – as he says.是的 - 添加表情符号可以更清楚地表明你理解和表达情感，并表现出同理心。正如他所说，在数字通信中，我们缺乏面对面互动中的视觉信号。 Neil(尼尔)Interaction, meaning ‘when people or things communicate with each other’. We can also interact with things like machines, computers and social media.交互，意思是“当人或事物相互交流时”。我们还可以与机器、计算机和社交媒体等事物进行交互。 Dan(担)Yes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we’re talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues.是的，埃文斯教授说，当我们相互交谈时，60% 的信息来自非语言线索。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, that’s a lot. A cue is a signal that you need to do something.哇，好多。提示是您需要做某事的信号。 Dan(担)For example, an actor goes on stage after their cue.例如，演员在提示后上台。 Neil(尼尔)And non-verbal means ‘without using spoken language’. So, here in the studio there are lots of other non-verbal signals about how we’re feeling - non-verbal cues. For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan非语言的意思是“不使用口语”。所以，在录音室里，还有许多其他关于我们感受的非语言信号 —— 非语言暗示。例如我的面部表情、我的肢体语言、我的眼神、Dan Dan(担)There’s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let’s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer – how would you respond?那里有一丝愤怒，Neil。好的，让我们将其应用于数字通信。想象一下，我给你发了一条短信，说我用锤子敲打了我的手指 —— 你会怎么回应？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly?嗯，这要看情况。你伤得很重吗？ Dan(担)If I followed it with a sad face emoji, then…?如果我跟着一个悲伤的表情符号，那么……？ Neil(尼尔)Then I guess I’d know you hurt yourself. Poor you.那我就知道你伤到了自己。可怜的你。 Dan(担)But if I followed it with a laughing emoji – the one with the tears coming out because I’m laughing so much?但是，如果我跟着一个大笑的表情符号 —— 那个因为我笑得太多而流泪的表情符号呢？ Neil(尼尔)Then I’d probably reply saying how stupid and clumsy you are!那我可能会回答说你多么愚蠢和笨拙！ Dan(担)Exactly – without adding the emoji – it’s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the non-verbal cue – like my facial expression.确切地说 - 如果不添加表情符号 - 很难知道我的情绪状态。表情符号是非语言暗示 —— 就像我的面部表情一样。 Neil(尼尔)By the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy? Clumsy, means ‘physically awkward’ – someone who’s clumsy falls over a lot and drops things. Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren’t as new as I think?顺便说一句，有没有表示笨拙的表情符号？笨拙，意思是“身体笨拙” —— 笨拙的人经常摔倒并掉落东西。不管怎样，你是说表情符号并不像我想象的那么新吗？ Dan(担)Yes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982?是的，我问它们是什么时候发明的。是 a）1606、b）1862 还是 c）1982？ Neil(尼尔)I said 1982.我说的是 1982 年。 Dan(担)Well, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets.嗯，事实上，早在 1862 年，亚伯拉罕·林肯 （Abraham Lincoln） 就在报纸上转载了一篇诙谐的演讲，其中包括一个带有右括号的分号。 Neil(尼尔)Like a winking face?喜欢眨眼的脸？ Dan(担)Exactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error – or what we normally call a typo.完全。尽管人们认为这很遗憾只是一个印刷错误 —— 或者我们通常所说的拼写错误。 Neil(尼尔)A typo – a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly.拼写错误 – 键入速度过快或不小心时出现的拼写错误。 Dan(担)The official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in digital a communication.表情符号的正式诞生通常是在 1982 年，当时一位美国教授指导他的学生使用笑脸来表示笑话 - 在数字交流中。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, so they’re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let’s round up with another look at today’s words.哇，他们都超过 30 岁了。也许我应该开始使用它们。让我们再来看看今天的文字。 Dan(担)Sure. The first word we had was empathy. Do you have a lot of empathy, Neil?确定。我们得到的第一个词是同理心。尼尔，你有很多同理心吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I think I’m quite good at understanding other people’s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It’s important to empathise with your colleagues too.是的，我觉得我很擅长理解别人的感受。无论如何，我的朋友都告诉我！同情你的同事也很重要。 Dan(担)That’s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction.那不是我从你眼里看到的！是的，同理心是所有人类互动的重要组成部分。 Neil(尼尔)Nicely done. If two people interact, it means they ‘communicate with each other and react to each other’. It’s a pretty broad term.干得漂亮。如果两个人互动，这意味着他们“相互交流并相互反应”。这是一个相当宽泛的术语。 Dan(担)We could also talk about how the way children interact with the internet.我们还可以讨论孩子们如何与互联网互动。 Neil(尼尔)Way too much! Next up, we had non-verbal, meaning ‘without spoken language’. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan?太多了！接下来，我们有 non-verbal，意思是 “没有口语”。当我第一次去波兰旅行时，我使用了大量的非语言交流来传达我的信息。手部动作，用手指数数，诸如此类。下一个词，丹？ Dan(担)Next word… that is my cue to say the next word – which is in fact – cue. A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a cue to attack. Or I could give you a cue to… sing a song?下一个词…这就是我说下一个词的提示 —— 实际上是 —— 提示。提示是执行某项作的信号。指挥官可以给他的军官一个攻击的提示。或者我可以给你一个提示……唱歌？ Neil(尼尔)No thanks. I’ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like clumsy – meaning ‘physically awkward’. I’d have to say Dan, you’re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you’re not clumsy at all.不，谢谢。我将继续使用定义词，谢谢。就像笨拙 —— 意思是“身体上的尴尬”。我不得不说丹，你是一个运动型的人，一个有天赋的足球运动员 —— 你一点也不笨拙。 Dan(担)That’s what I thought until I broke my leg – after a clumsy opponent ran into me…我一直这么想，直到我摔断了腿 —— 在一个笨拙的对手撞到我之后…… Neil(尼尔)Ouch. Finally – we had type. No hang on, that’s not right. It should say typo. A typo is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message.哎哟。最后 - 我们有类型。不，等一下，这是不对的。它应该显示 typo。拼写错误是书面文档或数字文件或消息中的错误。 Dan(担)Always check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch – and what our lunch choices say about us. So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today? DanAh Neil, are you asking me to join you? I’d love to, thanks. There’s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just… NeilAh, actually – I was just asking to… open up today’s topic. Sorry. You see, I’ve brought a sandwich. DanOh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you’re not the only one – a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch – every day! And yes, it’s mostly sandwiches. NeilI had a curry yesterday. DanWell, it’s almost lunchtime so we’d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it: a) An hour and a halfb) 45 minutes c) 25 minutes NeilOh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I’m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right… just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish. NeilPeckish is a great word isn’t it – it’s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan? DanI am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn’t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches? Bee Wilson, AuthorThey were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of makeshift lunch when you couldn’t get anything better. DanSo – sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals. Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality – a solution you create when you can’t do anything better. NeilI can’t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan. DanThere’s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich – like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there’s no excuse. NeilIf you worked as hard as I did, Dan – you’d only have time for a sandwich! DanWhich is just what Bee Wilson was saying – we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let’s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day. NeilAnd let’s teach one more word first – utilitarian. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive. Julian Baggini, PhilosopherWhat lunch says about us is that we’re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, utilitarian attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything, we haven’t managed to make that an everyday thing – it remains something for the special occasions. NeilSo – he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient – where we have a functional, utilitarian attitude to life. DanExactly, we’re aware of a great food culture, we embrace this culture – but only for special occasions. NeilYes – let’s look at that word embrace. It normally means this… let me just… DanOh Neil, I didn’t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, embraced me. NeilJust as we can embrace physical things and people – we can also embrace ideas. DanHere’s an idea I embrace, Neil. We should all embrace new foods. Broaden our horizons. NeilTo broaden our horizons means ‘to open our minds and experience new things’. DanLet me broaden your horizons right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better team spirit if colleagues eat together. NeilOK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of team spirit – that is – getting on well with team members – having a feeling of belonging. DanFinally. Vietnamese? NeilOh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today’s question. How long do Brits take for lunch? DanWell the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits. Neil25 minutes? It’s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let’s run over the vocab one more time. DanFirst up we had peckish. It means ‘hungry – just a little hungry’. I’m feeling rather peckish at the moment, you? NeilI think I’ve gone beyond peckish, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next? DanWe had makeshift – which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team’s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a makeshift goalie. NeilOr, another example – when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a makeshift drum. DanI’m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word utilitarian? In the context we used it, it means ‘simple and functional, rather than beautiful’. NeilDo you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as utilitarian? DanI prefer classic and timeless. Please. NeilBut enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along. DanOh, are you going to hug me again? To embrace me? NeilNot this time, let’s stick with the metaphorical meaning – ‘to accept a new belief or idea’. DanFor example, I wasn’t sure about the new website design, but now I fully embrace it. NeilVery nice. And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together. DanIt looks like you’ve broadened your horizons. NeilWell, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons and taught me about new ways of life. How about you? DanYes, they say travel broadens the mind – it certainly broadened my horizons too. NeilEven better – why don’t we go travelling together – with the whole Learning English team? DanYeah! That would be wonderful for team spirit –the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia? NeilIt certainly would. And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个非常有用的词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch – and what our lunch choices say about us. So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today?我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论午餐这个可爱的话题 —— 以及我们的午餐选择对我们的影响。那么，Dan，你今天午餐做什么？ Dan(担)Ah Neil, are you asking me to join you? I’d love to, thanks. There’s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just…啊，尼尔，你是要我加入你的吗？我很乐意，谢谢。我们得去看看这个很棒的越南小地方，如果你只是…… Neil(尼尔)Ah, actually – I was just asking to… open up today’s topic. Sorry. You see, I’ve brought a sandwich.啊，实际上 —— 我只是要求……打开今天的话题。不好意思。你看，我带了一个三明治。 Dan(担)Oh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you’re not the only one – a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch – every day! And yes, it’s mostly sandwiches.哦，一个三明治。再！多么沉闷。好吧，你不是唯一一个 —— 2012 年的一项调查显示，三分之一的英国人每天午餐都吃完全相同的东西 —— ！是的，主要是三明治。 Neil(尼尔)I had a curry yesterday.我昨天吃了咖喱。 Dan(担)Well, it’s almost lunchtime so we’d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it:嗯，快到午餐时间了，所以我们最好继续我们的问题，即：英国的平均午休时间有多长？是吗： a) An hour and a half(a）一个半小时)b) 45 minutes c) 25 minutesb） 45 分钟 c） 25 分钟 Neil(尼尔)Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I’m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes哦，我希望这是一个半小时，但我很确定它一定是 c） 25 分钟 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish.好吧，我们会找出你是对的吗……就在午餐前！所有这些关于午餐的讨论实际上让我感到有点饿。 Neil(尼尔)Peckish is a great word isn’t it – it’s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan?Peckish 是个很棒的词，不是吗 —— 这是一个俚语，意思是有点饿。感觉饿了，丹？ Dan(担)I am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn’t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?我现在是。现在，关于你和你的三明治 Neil。两片带馅面包可能是最受欢迎的英国午餐选择，但以前不是这样。听美食作家 Bee Wilson 的话。她用哪个形容词来形容三明治？ Bee Wilson, Author(BeeWilson，作者)They were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of makeshift lunch when you couldn’t get anything better.他们是你在紧急情况下所拥有的。它们是你在长途火车旅行中所拥有的。这是一种临时午餐，当你找不到更好的东西时。 Dan(担)So – sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals. Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality – a solution you create when you can’t do anything better.所以 —— 三明治起源不起眼，是临时餐点。Makeshift 描述了一些临时的、低质量的东西 —— 当你无法做得更好时，你创建的解决方案。 Neil(尼尔)I can’t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan.我不禁觉得这一切都变得有点个人化了，丹。 Dan(担)There’s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich – like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there’s no excuse.吃三明治有时有一个非常实际的理由 —— 就像在火车上一样。不过，在工作日在办公室里，没有任何借口。 Neil(尼尔)If you worked as hard as I did, Dan – you’d only have time for a sandwich!如果你像我一样努力工作，丹 —— 你只有时间吃个三明治了！ Dan(担)Which is just what Bee Wilson was saying – we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let’s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day.这正是 Bee Wilson 所说的 —— 我们将午餐时间视为紧急情况。它说明了我们在英国对工作和食物的态度。接下来，让我们听听哲学家 Julian Baggini 对每天吃同样的东西的看法。 Neil(尼尔)And let’s teach one more word first – utilitarian. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive.让我们先再教一个词 – 功利主义。它描述的是实用和有用的东西，而不是有吸引力的东西。 Julian Baggini, Philosopher(朱利安·巴吉尼，哲学家)What lunch says about us is that we’re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, utilitarian attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything, we haven’t managed to make that an everyday thing – it remains something for the special occasions.午餐告诉我们的是，我们仍然非常受困于这种相当实用、高效、功利的态度，我们应该如何构建我们的日常生活；尽管我们拥抱这种伟大的饮食文化和一切，但我们并没有设法让它成为日常 —— 它仍然是特殊场合的事情。 Neil(尼尔)So – he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient – where we have a functional, utilitarian attitude to life.所以 – 他认为我们生活在一个重视效率的世界 – 我们对生活有一种功能性的、功利主义的态度。 Dan(担)Exactly, we’re aware of a great food culture, we embrace this culture – but only for special occasions.没错，我们知道一种伟大的饮食文化，我们接受这种文化 —— 但仅限于特殊场合。 Neil(尼尔)Yes – let’s look at that word embrace. It normally means this… let me just…是的 - 让我们看看 embrace 这个词。通常的意思是这个…让我就…… Dan(担)Oh Neil, I didn’t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, embraced me.哦，尼尔，我不知道你在乎。尼尔只是拥抱我，搂着我，拥抱我。 Neil(尼尔)Just as we can embrace physical things and people – we can also embrace ideas.正如我们可以拥抱有形的事物和人一样，我们也可以拥抱想法。 Dan(担)Here’s an idea I embrace, Neil. We should all embrace new foods. Broaden our horizons.Neil 先生，我赞同这个想法。我们都应该接受新食物。拓宽我们的视野。 Neil(尼尔)To broaden our horizons means ‘to open our minds and experience new things’.To broading our sight 的意思是“打开我们的思维并体验新事物”。 Dan(担)Let me broaden your horizons right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better team spirit if colleagues eat together.现在让我拓宽你们的视野。康奈尔大学的专家表示，如果同事们一起吃饭，会带来更好的团队精神。 Neil(尼尔)OK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of team spirit – that is – getting on well with team members – having a feeling of belonging.好的，我明白了。我应该扔掉我的三明治，和你一起吃饭。以团队精神的名义 – 也就是说 – 与团队成员相处融洽 – 有归属感。 Dan(担)Finally. Vietnamese?最后。越南语？ Neil(尼尔)Oh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today’s question. How long do Brits take for lunch?哦，是的，但在你告诉我今天问题的答案之前。英国人的午餐需要多长时间？ Dan(担)Well the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits.嗯，答案是 c） 25 分钟。这来自 BBC 今年进行的一项调查，旨在了解我们的现代用餐习惯。 Neil(尼尔)25 minutes? It’s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let’s run over the vocab one more time.25 分钟？真是太可惜了，丹。但在我们自己吃午饭之前，让我们再来一遍这个词汇。 Dan(担)First up we had peckish. It means ‘hungry – just a little hungry’. I’m feeling rather peckish at the moment, you?首先，我们饿了。它的意思是 “饿 – 只是有点饿”。我现在感觉有点饿，你？ Neil(尼尔)I think I’ve gone beyond peckish, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next?我想我已经超越了饥饿，丹。午餐时滚动。下一个？ Dan(担)We had makeshift – which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team’s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a makeshift goalie.我们有 makeshift – 它描述了一个临时或低质量的解决方案。例如，上周我们球队的守门员生病了，所以我不得不把他换成临时守门员。 Neil(尼尔)Or, another example – when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a makeshift drum.或者，另一个例子 - 当我还是学生时，我用房间里的钢桶作为临时鼓。 Dan(担)I’m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word utilitarian? In the context we used it, it means ‘simple and functional, rather than beautiful’.我相信邻居们都喜欢这样。那么，功利主义这个词呢？在我们使用它的上下文中，它的意思是“简单而实用，而不是美丽”。 Neil(尼尔)Do you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as utilitarian?你认为用实用主义来形容你的 Polo 衫是公平的吗？ Dan(担)I prefer classic and timeless. Please.我更喜欢经典和永恒。请。 Neil(尼尔)But enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along.但这些玩笑已经够了。你知道的，我相信我们都应该和睦相处。 Dan(担)Oh, are you going to hug me again? To embrace me?哦，你又要拥抱我吗？拥抱我？ Neil(尼尔)Not this time, let’s stick with the metaphorical meaning – ‘to accept a new belief or idea’.不是这一次，让我们坚持隐喻的含义 —— “接受一个新的信念或想法”。 Dan(担)For example, I wasn’t sure about the new website design, but now I fully embrace it.例如，我对新网站设计不确定，但现在我完全接受了它。 Neil(尼尔)Very nice. And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together.很好。我接受您的建议，即同事们应该一起吃饭。 Dan(担)It looks like you’ve broadened your horizons.看起来你开阔了视野。 Neil(尼尔)Well, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons and taught me about new ways of life. How about you?当我在西班牙、日本、波兰和捷克共和国教英语时，它真的拓宽了我的视野，教会了我新的生活方式。你怎么样？ Dan(担)Yes, they say travel broadens the mind – it certainly broadened my horizons too.是的，他们说旅行可以开阔我的视野 —— 它当然也开阔了我的视野。 Neil(尼尔)Even better – why don’t we go travelling together – with the whole Learning English team?更棒的是 - 我们为什么不一起去旅行 - 与整个 Learning English 团队一起旅行呢？ Dan(担)Yeah! That would be wonderful for team spirit –the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia?是的！这对团队精神来说真是太棒了 —— 在一起的感觉很好。也许去柬埔寨？ Neil(尼尔)It certainly would.

I’m Dan… CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course… DanHow would you like to be a mermaid? CatherineA half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth. DanWell, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer. CatherineI suppose I will. Go on then. DanWhen did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineOk, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine? CatherineWell, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth. DanThey certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example? CatherineMany people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’. DanYes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913. CatherineThere you go! There’s no real evidence. DanWhat if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA? CatherineYou’re telling me fish tales, Dan DanOk. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain. Daniel Craig, mermanA lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident. CatherineSo it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan? DanA real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay. CatherineHang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks. DanThere you go then! CatherineBut there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like? DanWell, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much. Daniel Craig, mermanIt’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway. CatherineSo he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’. DanYes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’. CatherineWell, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question. DanI definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineAnd I said I think it was the 2000s DanAnd you have hit the nail on the head. Well done. CatherineThank you DanYou’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine? CatherineUS President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual? DanWell, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party. CatherineSpooky. DanThe next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’. CatherineNext up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan? DanOne Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine? CatherineTwo weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan? DanMy favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! CatherineAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course…我是 Catherine。在这个节目中，我们将讨论美人鱼，当然还会教你 6 个新的词汇项目…… Dan(担)How would you like to be a mermaid?你想成为美人鱼吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth.半人半鱼？嗯，Dan，我觉得这都是个神话。 Dan(担)Well, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.那么，你会发现本周的问题有点难以回答。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I suppose I will. Go on then.我想我会的。那就继续吧。 Dan(担)When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?最近一次据称目击美人鱼的事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Ok, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.好的，你说的 alleged，你的意思是 ‘说或相信是真的，但未经证实’。我不相信美人鱼，但我认为有很多人相信，所以我会说 c） 2000 年代。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。那么，凯瑟琳，你对美人鱼了解多少呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.嗯，美人鱼是一种外表与女性相似的生物，但美人鱼没有腿，而是有鱼的尾巴。雄性被称为人鱼，它们生活在海洋中。我认为他们是一个神话。 Dan(担)They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?他们肯定是神话般的。他们出现在来自世界各地的传说和故事中。故事中已知最早的可以追溯到公元前 1000 年左右的古亚述。你能想到一个更现代的例子吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’.很多人都熟悉迪斯尼的故事《小美人鱼》。 Dan(担)Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.是的。在成为动画电影之前，它是汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生 （Hans Christian Andersen） 创作的著名童话故事，于 1837 年首次出版。有趣的是，自 1913 年以来，丹麦哥本哈根一直矗立着小美人鱼的小铜像。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)There you go! There’s no real evidence.给你！没有真正的证据。 Dan(担)What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?如果我告诉你，最近有 200 多条美人鱼聚集在美国北卡罗来纳州的格林斯博罗，会怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re telling me fish tales, Dan你在给我讲鱼的故事，丹 Dan(担)Ok. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.好吧，我承认。他们不是真正的美人鱼。每个人都是穿着齐腰高的乳胶尾巴的正常人。他们相聚一堂，分享对水生神话的兴趣，拍摄水下照片和游泳。对于他们中的许多人来说，这也是一个收入来源！听听 Daniel Craig，五年人鱼，解释。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident.我们在这里参加的很多美人鱼都是专业的美人鱼。他们将在生日派对、社交活动、公司活动中娱乐。我偶然发现了美人鱼社区。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan?所以这也是一份工作！一个专业的人鱼。丹尼尔说，他是偶然发现的，或者说是“偶然发现的”。所以，这并不算数，不是吗 Dan？ Dan(担)A real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.一条真正的美人鱼？那是一壶不同的鱼，这是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。好吧，虽然我们没有确凿的证据，例如真正的美人鱼的照片，但已经有几次目击事件。最近的一次是 2009 年在海法湾。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.等一下，这敲响了警钟！那是在以色列，不是吗？据称，它出现在日落时分。显然，美人鱼在耍花招。 Dan(担)There you go then!那你去吧！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?但是，丹，没有理由相信这只是一个骗局，意思是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或有时是残忍”。好吧，无论真实与否，成为美人鱼可能会很有趣。我想知道那会是什么样子？ Dan(担)Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.嗯，我可以帮忙。让 Daniel Craig 解释一下他为什么这么喜欢它。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)It’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway.它只是宁静的。这是临时度假的理想场所。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’.所以他喜欢这里，因为它很宁静，意思是“平静祥和”。 Dan(担)Yes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’.是的，他说这是一个完美的度假胜地，是“一个你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.好吧，我仍然不相信美人鱼，但我确实相信，Dan，你问了我一个问题。 Dan(担)I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?我肯定是这样。我问，最近一次所谓的美人鱼目击事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said I think it was the 2000s我说我认为是 2000 年代 Dan(担)And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.而你已经一针见血了。干的好。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you谢谢 Dan(担)You’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?你是对的。那是 2000 年代。那是 2012 年在津巴布韦，水资源部长报告了这一事件。让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。我们的第一个词是据称。如果某事被指控，它就是 “说或相信是真的，但未被证明是真的”。你能想到最近的一个例子吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）声称报纸一直在刊登假新闻，但显然没有证据。而我们的下一个是偶然发现的。所以，如果你偶然发现了一些东西，你 “偶然遇到或发现它”。这是一个短语动词，你也可以说 come acounter。那么，Dan，你有没有偶然发现过什么不寻常的事情？ Dan(担)Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party.嗯，有一次我要去霍尔本参加一个派对，我完全迷路了。在我面前的地板上，我偶然发现了一张伦敦地图。它让我直接进入了派对。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Spooky.怪异。 Dan(担)The next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’.在那之后的下一个是不同的鱼缸。A different kettle of fish 是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。你也可以使用 ‘a horse of a different colour’ 这个短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Next up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?接下来，我们遇到了骗局。骗局是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或残忍”。丹，你上次做的骗局是什么？ Dan(担)One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine?有一年圣诞节，我把一个坏掉的灯泡装进盒子里，作为礼物送给了妈妈。我假装把它掉了下来，破碎的灯泡发出玻璃破碎的声音，她以为我打破了她的礼物。之后，我们听到了宁静的声音。Serene 的意思是“平静祥和”。名词是 serenity。你对宁静有什么看法，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday.

I’m Dan… CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course… DanHow would you like to be a mermaid? CatherineA half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth. DanWell, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer. CatherineI suppose I will. Go on then. DanWhen did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineOk, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine? CatherineWell, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth. DanThey certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example? CatherineMany people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’. DanYes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913. CatherineThere you go! There’s no real evidence. DanWhat if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA? CatherineYou’re telling me fish tales, Dan DanOk. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain. Daniel Craig, mermanA lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident. CatherineSo it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan? DanA real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay. CatherineHang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks. DanThere you go then! CatherineBut there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like? DanWell, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much. Daniel Craig, mermanIt’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway. CatherineSo he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’. DanYes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’. CatherineWell, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question. DanI definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineAnd I said I think it was the 2000s DanAnd you have hit the nail on the head. Well done. CatherineThank you DanYou’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine? CatherineUS President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual? DanWell, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party. CatherineSpooky. DanThe next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’. CatherineNext up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan? DanOne Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine? CatherineTwo weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan? DanMy favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! CatherineAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course…我是 Catherine。在这个节目中，我们将讨论美人鱼，当然还会教你 6 个新的词汇项目…… Dan(担)How would you like to be a mermaid?你想成为美人鱼吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth.半人半鱼？嗯，Dan，我觉得这都是个神话。 Dan(担)Well, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.那么，你会发现本周的问题有点难以回答。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I suppose I will. Go on then.我想我会的。那就继续吧。 Dan(担)When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?最近一次据称目击美人鱼的事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Ok, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.好的，你说的 alleged，你的意思是 ‘说或相信是真的，但未经证实’。我不相信美人鱼，但我认为有很多人相信，所以我会说 c） 2000 年代。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。那么，凯瑟琳，你对美人鱼了解多少呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.嗯，美人鱼是一种外表与女性相似的生物，但美人鱼没有腿，而是有鱼的尾巴。雄性被称为人鱼，它们生活在海洋中。我认为他们是一个神话。 Dan(担)They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?他们肯定是神话般的。他们出现在来自世界各地的传说和故事中。故事中已知最早的可以追溯到公元前 1000 年左右的古亚述。你能想到一个更现代的例子吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’.很多人都熟悉迪斯尼的故事《小美人鱼》。 Dan(担)Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.是的。在成为动画电影之前，它是汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生 （Hans Christian Andersen） 创作的著名童话故事，于 1837 年首次出版。有趣的是，自 1913 年以来，丹麦哥本哈根一直矗立着小美人鱼的小铜像。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)There you go! There’s no real evidence.给你！没有真正的证据。 Dan(担)What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?如果我告诉你，最近有 200 多条美人鱼聚集在美国北卡罗来纳州的格林斯博罗，会怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re telling me fish tales, Dan你在给我讲鱼的故事，丹 Dan(担)Ok. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.好吧，我承认。他们不是真正的美人鱼。每个人都是穿着齐腰高的乳胶尾巴的正常人。他们相聚一堂，分享对水生神话的兴趣，拍摄水下照片和游泳。对于他们中的许多人来说，这也是一个收入来源！听听 Daniel Craig，五年人鱼，解释。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident.我们在这里参加的很多美人鱼都是专业的美人鱼。他们将在生日派对、社交活动、公司活动中娱乐。我偶然发现了美人鱼社区。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan?所以这也是一份工作！一个专业的人鱼。丹尼尔说，他是偶然发现的，或者说是“偶然发现的”。所以，这并不算数，不是吗 Dan？ Dan(担)A real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.一条真正的美人鱼？那是一壶不同的鱼，这是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。好吧，虽然我们没有确凿的证据，例如真正的美人鱼的照片，但已经有几次目击事件。最近的一次是 2009 年在海法湾。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.等一下，这敲响了警钟！那是在以色列，不是吗？据称，它出现在日落时分。显然，美人鱼在耍花招。 Dan(担)There you go then!那你去吧！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?但是，丹，没有理由相信这只是一个骗局，意思是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或有时是残忍”。好吧，无论真实与否，成为美人鱼可能会很有趣。我想知道那会是什么样子？ Dan(担)Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.嗯，我可以帮忙。让 Daniel Craig 解释一下他为什么这么喜欢它。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)It’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway.它只是宁静的。这是临时度假的理想场所。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’.所以他喜欢这里，因为它很宁静，意思是“平静祥和”。 Dan(担)Yes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’.是的，他说这是一个完美的度假胜地，是“一个你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.好吧，我仍然不相信美人鱼，但我确实相信，Dan，你问了我一个问题。 Dan(担)I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?我肯定是这样。我问，最近一次所谓的美人鱼目击事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said I think it was the 2000s我说我认为是 2000 年代 Dan(担)And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.而你已经一针见血了。干的好。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you谢谢 Dan(担)You’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?你是对的。那是 2000 年代。那是 2012 年在津巴布韦，水资源部长报告了这一事件。让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。我们的第一个词是据称。如果某事被指控，它就是 “说或相信是真的，但未被证明是真的”。你能想到最近的一个例子吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）声称报纸一直在刊登假新闻，但显然没有证据。而我们的下一个是偶然发现的。所以，如果你偶然发现了一些东西，你 “偶然遇到或发现它”。这是一个短语动词，你也可以说 come acounter。那么，Dan，你有没有偶然发现过什么不寻常的事情？ Dan(担)Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party.嗯，有一次我要去霍尔本参加一个派对，我完全迷路了。在我面前的地板上，我偶然发现了一张伦敦地图。它让我直接进入了派对。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Spooky.怪异。 Dan(担)The next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’.在那之后的下一个是不同的鱼缸。A different kettle of fish 是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。你也可以使用 ‘a horse of a different colour’ 这个短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Next up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?接下来，我们遇到了骗局。骗局是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或残忍”。丹，你上次做的骗局是什么？ Dan(担)One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine?有一年圣诞节，我把一个坏掉的灯泡装进盒子里，作为礼物送给了妈妈。我假装把它掉了下来，破碎的灯泡发出玻璃破碎的声音，她以为我打破了她的礼物。之后，我们听到了宁静的声音。Serene 的意思是“平静祥和”。名词是 serenity。你对宁静有什么看法，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan?两个星期，躺在沙滩上，喝柠檬水，听着海浪的声音。瑰。最后我们终于逃脱了。逍遥游是一个非正式词，意思是“你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”，例如假期。那么，Dan，你最喜欢的度假胜地在哪里？ Dan(担)My favourite getaway is my yoga class.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course. DanCan we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I’ve got to shoot off to a party later. NeilShoot off meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it’s funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns. DanIs that so? I have a question about that for you. NeilFire away then. DanFire away, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? NeilI’m going to guess b) Iceland, just because I’ve never been there. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket? NeilIt’s got to be a gun. DanWell, in most countries in the world you’d be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon – which is a kind of blanket – and they wrap them up and restrain them, or prevent them from moving. NeilYou’re pulling my leg. DanNope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation: Anthony Berteaux, Japanese JournalistWhat most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it’s always to de-escalate it. NeilSo, they safely restrain the person and wait for the situation to de-escalate, or become less intense. DanUnless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons. NeilSurely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then? DanYou’d think so, but no. It seems that guns don’t really feature in crimes much in Japan. NeilWell, that’s astonishing. So do you think the criminals don’t carry guns because the police don’t carry guns or that the police don’t carry guns because the criminals don’t carry guns? DanWow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don’t know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society. Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed ViolenceThe American model has been militarise the police, but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society. And I’m very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals. NeilSo, America tends to militarise its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army… Dan…and that causes an arms race with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group. NeilHe also said that there’s not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful? DanWell, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked? NeilI think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland. DanWell, I’m sorry Neil, that’s not right. But, don’t shoot the messenger, OK? It’s Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685. NeilHow interesting. Now, let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. DanSure, we had shoot off. If you shoot off, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example? NeilIt’s a phrasal verb so it’s used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, he shot off to the hospital. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had fire away. Now, fire away is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question? DanI’d say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. Restrain. If you restrain someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might restrain yourself from doing something – for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to restrain your children from anything, Neil? NeilI have to restrain my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and restrain them. OK, de-escalate – If something de-escalates, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan? DanWell, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises escalated over a period of two weeks and de- escalated only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! Militarise. If something is militarised, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become militarised, Neil. NeilYes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service – that’s join the army for a couple of years – so they became militarised. Now, an arms race. An arms race is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan? DanThe most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an arms race to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! NeilAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论武装警察，当然也会教你六项新的词汇。 Dan(担)Can we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I’ve got to shoot off to a party later.我们今天能快点完成这件事吗，Neil？只是我得稍后去参加一个派对。 Neil(尼尔)Shoot off meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it’s funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns.Shoot off 意味着快速离开。我们当然可以。有趣的是，你应该提到射击，因为我们本周的主题是没有枪支的枪支管制。 Dan(担)Is that so? I have a question about that for you.是吗？我有一个问题要问你。 Neil(尼尔)Fire away then.然后开火。 Dan(担)Fire away, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan?fire away，允许某人提出问题或发言的表达式。那么，哪个国家的枪支管制法律是世界上最古老的呢？是 a） 美国，b） 冰岛还是 c） 日本？ Neil(尼尔)I’m going to guess b) Iceland, just because I’ve never been there.我猜 b） 冰岛，只是因为我从来没有去过那里。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。现在，想象一下这个场景。您是一名警察，被派去处理一起事件。当你到达现场时，你发现了一个危险的罪犯。你伸手去拿枪还是毯子？ Neil(尼尔)It’s got to be a gun.它必须是一把枪。 Dan(担)Well, in most countries in the world you’d be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon – which is a kind of blanket – and they wrap them up and restrain them, or prevent them from moving.嗯，在世界上大多数国家你都是对的，但在日本不是。尽管日本警察携带枪支，但几乎从不使用枪支。相反，他们依靠武术的组合，在许多情况下，当一个人有暴力行为时，他们会拿出被褥 —— 这是一种毯子 —— 然后把他们裹起来，束缚他们，或阻止他们移动。 Neil(尼尔)You’re pulling my leg.你在拉我的腿。 Dan(担)Nope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation:不！听听日本记者 Anthony Berteaux 描述这种情况： Anthony Berteaux, Japanese Journalist(AnthonyBerteaux，日本记者)What most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it’s always to de-escalate it.大多数日本警察会做的是弄来巨大的被褥，基本上把施暴或喝醉的人卷进一个小墨西哥卷饼里，把他们带回警察局，让他们冷静下来。对暴力的反应从来都不是暴力，而是总是缓和暴力。 Neil(尼尔)So, they safely restrain the person and wait for the situation to de-escalate, or become less intense.因此，他们安全地控制住这个人，并等待情况缓和或变得不那么激烈。 Dan(担)Unless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons.除非罪犯有枪，否则日本警察从不开枪。 Neil(尼尔)Surely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then?这肯定意味着罪犯总是占优势吗？ Dan(担)You’d think so, but no. It seems that guns don’t really feature in crimes much in Japan.你可能会这么认为，但不是。在日本，枪支似乎并不真正出现在犯罪中。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s astonishing. So do you think the criminals don’t carry guns because the police don’t carry guns or that the police don’t carry guns because the criminals don’t carry guns?嗯，这太令人惊讶了。那么，您认为罪犯不携带枪支是因为警察不携带枪支，还是因为罪犯不携带枪支而警察不携带枪支？ Dan(担)Wow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don’t know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society.哇，真让我头疼！好吧，我不知道，但请听听武装暴力行动组织执行主任伊恩·奥弗顿 （Iain Overton） 对社会武装警察的看法。 Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence(伊恩·奥弗顿（IainOverton），武装暴力行动组织执行主任)The American model has been militarise the police, but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society. And I’m very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals.美国的模式是将警察军事化，但我面临的挑战是，几乎没有证据表明警察更加军事化会带来一个更和平的社会。我非常担心，如果有太多警察在第一次犯罪时拔枪，那么会导致警察和罪犯之间的小型军备竞赛。 Neil(尼尔)So, America tends to militarise its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army…所以，美国倾向于将其警察军事化，以装备他们并把他们当作军队来使用…… Dan(担)…and that causes an arms race with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group.…这会导致与罪犯的军备竞赛，这是两个群体之间争夺比另一个群体拥有更多武器的竞争。 Neil(尼尔)He also said that there’s not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful?他还表示，武装警察与和平社会之间没有很强的联系。那么，这是否意味着日本社会更加和平呢？ Dan(担)Well, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked?好吧，那里仍然发生暴力犯罪，但罪犯往往携带其他武器，例如剑和刀，但至少这是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。现在，您还记得我问的测验问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)I think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland.我认为如此。你问我哪个国家的枪支管制法律是世界上最古老的？是 a） 美国，b） 冰岛还是 c） 日本？我说 b） 冰岛。 Dan(担)Well, I’m sorry Neil, that’s not right. But, don’t shoot the messenger, OK? It’s Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685.好吧，对不起，尼尔，这不对。但是，不要向信使开枪，好吗？日本于 1685 年实施了枪支管制法。 Neil(尼尔)How interesting. Now, let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme.真有趣。现在，让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。 Dan(担)Sure, we had shoot off. If you shoot off, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example?当然，我们已经开枪了。如果你开枪，那就意味着你匆忙离开某个地方。尼尔是什么类型的动词？您能给我们举个例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)It’s a phrasal verb so it’s used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, he shot off to the hospital. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had fire away. Now, fire away is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question?它是一个短语动词，因此在对话中使用，通常在非正式上下文中使用。举个例子，当他听说妻子生病时，他立即赶往医院。同义词可以是 dash off 或 run off。接下来我们把火烧走了。现在，fire away 是一个允许某人提出问题或发言的表达式。Dan，你能想到其他方式来表达同样的事情吗，如果我说，我可以问你一个问题吗？ Dan(担)I’d say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. Restrain. If you restrain someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might restrain yourself from doing something – for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to restrain your children from anything, Neil?我会说是的，当然，去吧，请这样做，或者一定要这样做。抑制。如果你约束某人，你就阻止他们移动。从另一种意义上说，你可能会克制自己做某事 —— 例如：吃巧克力！尼尔，你有没有不得不约束你的孩子做任何事情？ Neil(尼尔)I have to restrain my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and restrain them. OK, de-escalate – If something de-escalates, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan?我必须一直约束我的孩子，丹，否则他们会疯狂地打架。我必须把他们拉开并约束他们。好的，降级 – 如果某件事降级，它会变得不那么激烈。这通常用于冲突或争论的上下文中。丹，你能想出一个历史上的例子吗？ Dan(担)Well, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises escalated over a period of two weeks and de- escalated only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! Militarise. If something is militarised, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become militarised, Neil.嗯，在 1960 年代，古巴导弹危机在两周内升级，只有在外交谈判成功后才有所缓和。但它一度非常接近第三次世界大战！军事化。如果某物是军事化的，它就会像军队一样装备和使用。给我举个军事化的例子吧，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service – that’s join the army for a couple of years – so they became militarised. Now, an arms race. An arms race is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan?是的，当我在英国读书时，一些外国学生不得不回国参加国民服役 —— 也就是参军几年 —— 所以他们变得军事化了。现在，一场军备竞赛。军备竞赛是两组人之间为了获得比另一组人更多的武器而进行的比赛。有个例子吗，Dan？ Dan(担)The most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an arms race to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!最著名的例子是冷战。苏联和美国都卷入了一场军备竞赛，以尽可能多地储存核武器。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Neil(尼尔)And we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.我们也在社交媒体上，所以请务必在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上访问我们。 Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】to shoot offto leave somewhere in a hurry匆匆离开to leave somewhere quickly and suddenly.He shot off to catch the train.他赶紧跑着去赶火车。 fire awayan expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak.尽管问吧Go ahead and ask your questions or say what you want to say.Fire away, I’m all ears.尽管问，我洗耳恭听。 restrainprevent someone from moving阻止to prevent someone or something from doing something or from moving.Police struggled to restrain the angry protesters.警方努力控制住愤怒的抗议者。 de-escalatebecome less intense降级to make something less intense or serious.The situation de-escalated after a period of intense negotiations.经过一段时间的紧张谈判，局势有所缓和。 militariseto equip or use something or someone like an army军事化to equip or organize something or someone for military purposes.The government is accused of militarising the police force.政府被指控将警察部队军事化。 arms racea competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group军备竞赛a competition between countries to have more and better weapons than each other.The Cold War was characterized by a dangerous arms race between the US and the Soviet Union.冷战的特点是美国和苏联之间危险的军备竞赛。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】浪漫怎么会毁了爱情？","path":"/2017/02/16/wechat-2017-02-16/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing romance, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course. Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset? DanOh Neil, it’s all over! She broke up with me on Valentine’s Day! She said I wasn’t the one. NeilCheer up Dan, cheer up. It’s not your fault. DanNo? NeilYou can blame romanticism. DanRomanticism? What’s that? NeilRomanticism was a movement that started in Europe and spread worldwide. It influenced literature, art, poetry, music and the way people behaved. DanA movement meaning ‘a group of people working together to support an idea’? NeilYes. And that bring us on to this week’s question. When was the start of the romantic period? Was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18thth century or c) the end of the 18th century? DanWell, I honestly have no idea, so I’m going to go smack in the middle… the middle of the 18th century. NeilAnd we’ll find out later on in the show if you got the question right. Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend, let me take a wild guess… love at first sight, was it? DanWell… yes. What’s your point? NeilWell, it’s not your fault, Dan. That idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the zeitgeist, and many of these ideas still continue today. DanZeitgeist, the word comes from German and literally means ‘the spirit of the time’. NeilA lot of what we believe about love today – for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after - comes from the romantic period. DanBut, everyone loves a bit of romance! NeilWell, that’s true. However, it’s one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals. DanTrue, it might not be a realistic benchmark, and by that I mean ‘a standard from which other things are judged’. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be…and then we get disappointed by the real thing? NeilWell, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty, meaning ‘practical details’. Details like work, stress, children…all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life. DanNot to mention, the fact that everyone is flawed, or ‘imperfect’, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons. NeilExactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work. DanAnd if the relationship you are in isn’t as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you’re with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that’s true for everyone’s relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them. NeilWell, I asked these people about theirs… INSERTIs your partner 100% perfect for you? No. Not 100%. No, I don’t think that’s true. DanDoes that mean true love doesn’t exist? NeilNo. It just means that all relationships must be worked on and that perfection is impossible. But we should never give up trying. DanYou’re right! She wasn’t the one for me! I need to find my next Juliet. She’ll be just perfect! NeilOh Dan. You haven’t learnt anything! You’re just a hopeless romantic. Now, can you remember the quiz question? I asked you when the Romantic period originated? Was it a) th th th the beginning of the 18 century, b) the middle of the 18 century or c) the end of the 18 century? DanAnd I said: the middle of the 18th century. NeilWrong I’m afraid! It was towards the end of the 18th century. DanI have nothing good in my life at the moment. NeilShall we take a look at the vocabulary too? DanSure. The first word we had was: movement – a movement is a ‘group of people working together to support an idea’. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil? NeilThe environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the movement for equality – gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was zeitgeist – now, a zeitgeist literally means ‘the spirit of a particular time’. What would you say that the zeitgeist is these days, Dan? DanWell, I think there’s a focus on personal freedom. There’s environmental concern, and of course, let’s not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was benchmark – a benchmark is a ‘standard from which other things are judged’. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be? NeilWell, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the benchmark for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have: idealised – an idealised thing is an ‘often imagined, perfect version’ of something. Now, what three things would exist in an idealised world for you then, Dan? DanI would say, personal freedom, religious tolerance and free ice-cream for everybody on a daily basis. NeilBrilliant! OK! DanNext we have nitty-gritty – the nitty-gritty is the ‘important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing’. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the nitty-gritty of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples! NeilWell, you have to decide who’s going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food - some people don’t like this, some people don’t like that. You’ve got to get the flowers right. Oh, there’s so much to think about – makes you think that marriage might be flawed… and flawed – is a thing which is ‘imperfect in some way’. London’s a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan? DanWell, I think it’s flawed in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade – there’s never enough space on the carriages. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing romance, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course. Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset?我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论浪漫，当然也会教你 6 个新的词汇。现在，丹，你为什么看起来这么难过？ Dan(担)Oh Neil, it’s all over! She broke up with me on Valentine’s Day! She said I wasn’t the one.哦，尼尔，一切都结束了！她在情人节那天和我分手了！她说我不是那个人。 Neil(尼尔)Cheer up Dan, cheer up. It’s not your fault.振作起来，丹，振作起来。这不是你的错。 Dan(担)No?不？ Neil(尼尔)You can blame romanticism.你可以责怪浪漫主义。 Dan(担)Romanticism? What’s that?浪漫主义？什么？ Neil(尼尔)Romanticism was a movement that started in Europe and spread worldwide. It influenced literature, art, poetry, music and the way people behaved.浪漫主义是一场起源于欧洲并传播到全世界的运动。它影响了文学、艺术、诗歌、音乐和人们的行为方式。 Dan(担)A movement meaning ‘a group of people working together to support an idea’?一个运动的意思是“一群人一起努力支持一个想法”？ Neil(尼尔)Yes. And that bring us on to this week’s question. When was the start of the romantic period? Was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18thth century or c) the end of the 18th century?是的。这让我们进入了本周的问题。浪漫时期是从什么时候开始的？是 a） 18 世纪初，b） 18 世纪中叶还是 c） 18 世纪末？ Dan(担)Well, I honestly have no idea, so I’m going to go smack in the middle… the middle of the 18th century.好吧，老实说我不知道，所以我要去中间打……18 世纪中叶。 Neil(尼尔)And we’ll find out later on in the show if you got the question right. Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend, let me take a wild guess… love at first sight, was it?我们稍后会在节目中发现您是否回答正确。现在，回到你的前女友，让我大胆猜测一下……一见钟情，是吗？ Dan(担)Well… yes. What’s your point?井。。。是的。你的意思是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it’s not your fault, Dan. That idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the zeitgeist, and many of these ideas still continue today.好吧，这不是你的错，丹。这个想法很浪漫，我的意思是它起源于浪漫主义时代。这是时代精神的一部分，其中许多想法今天仍在继续。 Dan(担)Zeitgeist, the word comes from German and literally means ‘the spirit of the time’.Zeitgeist，这个词来自德语，字面意思是“时代精神”。 Neil(尼尔)A lot of what we believe about love today – for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after - comes from the romantic period.我们今天对爱情的很多信念 —— 例如，两个人会从此幸福生活的想法 —— 都来自浪漫时期。 Dan(担)But, everyone loves a bit of romance!但是，每个人都喜欢一点浪漫！ Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s true. However, it’s one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals.嗯，这是真的。然而，享受浪漫是一回事，但根据浪漫理想来评判你们的关系可能是危险的。 Dan(担)True, it might not be a realistic benchmark, and by that I mean ‘a standard from which other things are judged’. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be…and then we get disappointed by the real thing?诚然，它可能不是一个现实的基准，我的意思是“评判其他事物的标准”。所以我们从小就听着这些浪漫的故事长大，这让我们对一段关系的意义产生了一种观念……然后我们对真实的东西感到失望？ Neil(尼尔)Well, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty, meaning ‘practical details’. Details like work, stress, children…all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life.嗯，坦率地说，是的。浪漫的理想就是这样 —— 一段关系的理想化版本，或完美版本。但它往往忽略了细节，即“实际细节”。工作、压力、孩子等细节……我们在日常生活中必须处理的所有事情。 Dan(担)Not to mention, the fact that everyone is flawed, or ‘imperfect’, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons.更不用说，每个人都以自己的方式存在缺陷或“不完美”的事实。这意味着我们会因为各种原因而生气、喜怒无常或不安。 Neil(尼尔)Exactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work.完全！许多流行的爱情故事以人物聚在一起或结婚结束。但很少有人向我们展示如何让这个人长期保持特别。一段关系是一项艰苦的工作。 Dan(担)And if the relationship you are in isn’t as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you’re with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that’s true for everyone’s relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them.如果你的关系并不像故事所说的那么完美，那么也许你和错误的人在一起了，这可以解释为什么这么多婚姻以离婚告终。我想知道每个人的关系是否都是如此。幸运的是，我找到了一些有伴侣的人并询问了他们。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I asked these people about theirs…好吧，我问了这些人关于他们的…… INSERT(插入)Is your partner 100% perfect for you? No. Not 100%. No, I don’t think that’s true.您的伴侣 100% 适合您吗？不。不是 100%。不，我不认为这是真的。 Dan(担)Does that mean true love doesn’t exist?这是否意味着真爱不存在？ Neil(尼尔)No. It just means that all relationships must be worked on and that perfection is impossible. But we should never give up trying.不。它只是意味着所有的关系都必须努力，完美是不可能的。但我们永远不应该放弃尝试。 Dan(担)You’re right! She wasn’t the one for me! I need to find my next Juliet. She’ll be just perfect!你是对的！她不是适合我的那个人！我需要找到我的下一个朱丽叶。她会完美无缺！ Neil(尼尔)Oh Dan. You haven’t learnt anything! You’re just a hopeless romantic. Now, can you remember the quiz question? I asked you when the Romantic period originated? Was it a) th th th the beginning of the 18 century, b) the middle of the 18 century or c) the end of the 18 century?哦，丹。你什么都没学到！你只是一个无可救药的浪漫主义者。现在，您记得测验问题吗？我问你浪漫主义时期是什么时候起源的？是 a） 18 世纪初，b） 18 世纪中叶还是 c） 18 世纪末？ Dan(担)And I said: the middle of the 18th century.我说：18 世纪中叶。 Neil(尼尔)Wrong I’m afraid! It was towards the end of the 18th century.恐怕错了！那是在 18 世纪末。 Dan(担)I have nothing good in my life at the moment.我现在的生活没有什么好东西。 Neil(尼尔)Shall we take a look at the vocabulary too?我们也要看看这些词汇吗？ Dan(担)Sure. The first word we had was: movement – a movement is a ‘group of people working together to support an idea’. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil?确定。我们得到的第一个词是：运动 – 运动是“一群人共同努力支持一个想法”。Neil，你能想到任何现代的运动吗？ Neil(尼尔)The environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the movement for equality – gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was zeitgeist – now, a zeitgeist literally means ‘the spirit of a particular time’. What would you say that the zeitgeist is these days, Dan?目前，环保运动非常强大和受欢迎，平等运动也是如此 —— 例如性别平等。“我们得到的下一个词是 zeitgeist —— 现在，zeitgeist 的字面意思是”特定时代的精神”。Dan，你认为现在的时代精神是什么？ Dan(担)Well, I think there’s a focus on personal freedom. There’s environmental concern, and of course, let’s not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was benchmark – a benchmark is a ‘standard from which other things are judged’. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be?嗯，我认为人们关注的是个人自由。这里有环境问题，当然，我们不要忘记社交媒体的兴起。我们得到的下一个词是 benchmark – benchmark 是“评判其他事物的标准”。如果你在找新房子，Neil，你的基准是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the benchmark for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have: idealised – an idealised thing is an ‘often imagined, perfect version’ of something. Now, what three things would exist in an idealised world for you then, Dan?嗯，我现在的房子有一个花园，有我可以停车的地方，所以这将是新房子的基准。它至少必须有这个，甚至更多。接下来我们有：理想化 – 理想化的事物是某物的“经常想象的完美版本”。那么，Dan，在你的理想化世界中会存在哪三样东西呢？ Dan(担)I would say, personal freedom, religious tolerance and free ice-cream for everybody on a daily basis.我想说的是，个人自由、宗教宽容和每天为每个人提供免费的冰淇淋。 Neil(尼尔)Brilliant! OK!明！还行！ Dan(担)Next we have nitty-gritty – the nitty-gritty is the ‘important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing’. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the nitty-gritty of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples!接下来我们有了细节 —— 细节是“情况或事物中涉及的重要或实际细节”。现在，结婚应该是一件美妙的事情，但仪式的细节呢，尼尔。请给我们举几个例子！ Neil(尼尔)Well, you have to decide who’s going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food - some people don’t like this, some people don’t like that. You’ve got to get the flowers right. Oh, there’s so much to think about – makes you think that marriage might be flawed… and flawed – is a thing which is ‘imperfect in some way’. London’s a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan?嗯，你必须决定谁坐在谁旁边，邀请谁，食物 - 有些人不喜欢这个，有些人不喜欢那个。你得把花弄对。哦，有太多事情要考虑 – 让你觉得婚姻可能有缺陷……和 flawed – 是“在某种程度上不完美”的事物。伦敦是个很棒的城市，但你觉得怎么样，Dan？ Dan(担)Well, I think it’s flawed in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade – there’s never enough space on the carriages. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!嗯，我认为公共交通使用升级的方式是有缺陷的 —— 车厢上永远没有足够的空间。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Neil(尼尔)And we are on social media too.

I’m Catherine… NeilAnd I’m Neil. CatherineSo, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today? NeilHave you done your hair differently? CatherineNo. NeilIs that a new outfit? CatherineHonestly, Neil! NeilI give up. I don’t know what’s different about you. CatherineOK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you’ll have figured it out. Anyway, today we’re discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today’s quiz question, Neil? NeilI am. CatherineOK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum? NeilWell, I have no idea. But I’ll say a) the temporal lobe. CatherineOK and we’ll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let’s talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn’t work like that. It’s a reconstructive process. NeilA reconstructive process? CatherineYes. We reconstruct - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be distorted – or changed – for different reasons. Let’s listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College at the University of London, talking about this. Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College, University of LondonFrom all those TV dramas you’ve watched you’ll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don’t introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don’t distort their memory. NeilSo crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don’t contaminate it with their DNA. CatherineThat’s right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means ‘made impure through contact with an outside source’. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can’t get back to the original information. NeilNow, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness’s memory of what happened. CatherineAnd it isn’t only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you’re being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker’s face. And at knifepoint means ‘under threat of being stabbed’. NeilSo why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts? CatherineEyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New YorkFirst, I think it’s sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It’s disconcerting to think that we’re going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be – and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it. NeilSo we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it’s disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And disconcerting means… Catherine…it means ‘confusing and a bit upsetting’. NeilKaren Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness testimony – or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that’s true, Catherine? CatherineYes – and it’s the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate. NeilAre there any ways to improve accuracy? CatherineYes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response. NeilYes, I see. Well, you didn’t give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show. CatherineYes, that’s true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that… I’m wearing glasses, Neil. I’ve lost my contact lenses! NeilI don’t know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses. CatherineJust a bit, yes. So, now we’re running out of time, so let’s move onto the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum? NeilI said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right? CatherineYou were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer! NeilYes! CatherineThe main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area – is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area behind your ears. NeilFascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today… reconstruct distorted crime scene contaminated at knifepoint disconcerting testimony CatherineAnd that bring us to the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to join us again soon! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine…您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil.我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?那么，Neil，你注意到我今天有什么不同吗？ Neil(尼尔)Have you done your hair differently?你的头发设计有不同吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)No.不。 Neil(尼尔)Is that a new outfit?那是一套新衣服吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Honestly, Neil!老实说，尼尔！ Neil(尼尔)I give up. I don’t know what’s different about you.我放弃了。我不知道你有什么不同。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you’ll have figured it out. Anyway, today we’re discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today’s quiz question, Neil?还行。好吧，也许在节目结束时你会弄清楚。无论如何，今天我们讨论的是记忆以及我们是否能准确地记住事物。那么，尼尔，你准备好回答今天的测验问题了吗？ Neil(尼尔)I am.我是。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum?还行。那么，大脑的哪个部分有专门用于记住面孔的区域呢？是吗。。。a） 颞叶？b） 下丘脑？或 c） 小脑？ Neil(尼尔)Well, I have no idea. But I’ll say a) the temporal lobe.嗯，我不知道。但我要说的是 a） 颞叶。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK and we’ll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let’s talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn’t work like that. It’s a reconstructive process.好的，我们将在稍后的节目中找出您是否选择了正确的答案。但是，让我们更多地谈谈我们的记忆是如何欺骗我们的。我们倾向于认为记忆就像一个录像机，我们可以一遍又一遍地重播和回忆它最初发生的情况。但记忆不是那样工作的。这是一个重建的过程。 Neil(尼尔)A reconstructive process?重建过程？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes. We reconstruct - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be distorted – or changed – for different reasons. Let’s listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College at the University of London, talking about this.是的。我们重建或重建记忆，在此过程中，它们可能会因不同的原因而被扭曲或更改。让我们听听伦敦大学金史密斯学院 （Goldsmith’s College at the University of London） 退休心理学教授蒂姆·瓦伦丁 （Tim Valentine） 谈论这个问题。 Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College, University of London(蒂姆·瓦伦丁（TimValentine），伦敦大学金史密斯学院（Goldsmith’sCollege，UniversityofLondon）退休心理学教授)From all those TV dramas you’ve watched you’ll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don’t introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don’t distort their memory.从你看过的所有电视剧中，你会熟悉犯罪警察穿着纸制西装，遮住鞋子和头发的法医现场，以确保他们不会将自己的 DNA 或物理痕迹引入犯罪现场。因此，任何与证人互动的人都需要确保他们不会扭曲自己的记忆。 Neil(尼尔)So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don’t contaminate it with their DNA.因此，犯罪警察在犯罪现场穿着防护服，这样他们就不会用 DNA 污染它。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means ‘made impure through contact with an outside source’. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can’t get back to the original information.没错。犯罪现场是犯罪发生的地方。而 infected 的意思是“通过与外部来源接触而变得不纯”。因此，例如，如果警官在没有戴手套的情况下触摸某物，他们就会引入新信息。一旦发生这种情况，您将无法返回原始信息。 Neil(尼尔)Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness’s memory of what happened.现在，蒂姆·瓦伦丁 （Tim Valentine） 说，当警察与犯罪证人交谈时，他们也可能会引入新的信息。这可能会改变证人对所发生的事情的记忆。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And it isn’t only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you’re being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker’s face. And at knifepoint means ‘under threat of being stabbed’.而且，不仅仅是警察的审问会扭曲记忆。其他因素（如压力）会影响您准确回忆事件的能力。例如，如果您被持刀指着，您很可能专注于武器而不是攻击者的脸。而 at knifepoint 的意思是“受到被刺伤的威胁”。 Neil(尼尔)So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?那么，为什么我们如此重视目击者的陈述呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further.目击者的陈述在法庭上听起来非常有说服力 —— 但事实上，根据研究，它们往往不可靠。纽约 Innocence Project 的高级律师 Karen Newirth 进一步解释了这一点。 Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York(KarenNewirth，纽约InnocenceProject高级律师)First, I think it’s sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It’s disconcerting to think that we’re going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be – and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.首先，我认为人们想要相信记忆可以是准确的是很自然的。想到我们一生中都依赖我们的记忆，然后了解它们可能有多么错误 —— 以及它们有多频繁，这令人不安。其次，目击者的证词已经成为一项非常令人期待的刑事审判，因此陪审员们在某种程度上预料到它，寻找它，并倾向于相信它。 Neil(尼尔)So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it’s disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And disconcerting means…因此，我们愿意相信我们能够准确记住事物。得知记忆经常不准确，这令人不安。而令人不安的意思是…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)…it means ‘confusing and a bit upsetting’.…它的意思是“令人困惑和有点不安”。 Neil(尼尔)Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness testimony – or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that’s true, Catherine?Karen Newirth 还表示，人们期待在法庭上看到目击者的证词或口头陈述。你认为这是真的吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes – and it’s the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate.是的 - 这是在法庭上针对刑事被告提出的最常用的证据，尽管它们通常不准确。 Neil(尼尔)Are there any ways to improve accuracy?有什么方法可以提高准确性吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.是的，有。例如，在警察阵容中，您可以阻止目击者从发出指示的警官那里接收信息，这可能会影响他们的反应。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, I see. Well, you didn’t give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show.是的，我明白了。好吧，当你在节目开始时问你的外表有什么不同时，你没有透露任何东西。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, that’s true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that… I’m wearing glasses, Neil. I’ve lost my contact lenses!是的，这是真的，尼尔。但我现在可以向你透露……我戴着眼镜，Neil。我的隐形眼镜丢了！ Neil(尼尔)I don’t know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.我不知道我是怎么错过的。因为实际上你戴眼镜看起来确实完全不同。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Just a bit, yes. So, now we’re running out of time, so let’s move onto the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum?只是一点点，是的。所以，现在我们的时间不多了，所以让我们继续回答今天的测验问题。记得我问过：大脑的哪个部分有专门用于识别面孔的区域？是吗。。。a） 颞叶？b） 下丘脑？或 c） 小脑？ Neil(尼尔)I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?我说的是 a） 颞叶。我是对的吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!你确实是，尼尔！做得非常好，这是正确的答案！ Neil(尼尔)Yes!是的！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area – is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area behind your ears.大脑中专门用于识别面孔的主要部分 —— 称为梭形面区域 —— 位于颞叶，大致位于耳后区域。 Neil(尼尔)Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today… reconstruct distorted crime scene contaminated at knifepoint disconcerting testimony迷人！现在，这是我们今天学到的单词……重建被刀指着污染的扭曲犯罪现场令人不安的证词 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that bring us to the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Catherine… NeilAnd I’m Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning! CatherineNo, really? NeilYeah. CatherineWow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don’t know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say? NeilWell, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London – something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone. CatherineWhich is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil. NeilYes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking… if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don’t I – and other commuters in the city – do it more often? CatherineWell, that’s a good question, Neil, and maybe we’ll find some answers in the show, because today we’re talking about why cities make us so rude. And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin? NeilI don’t know, but I’m going to say a) melatonin. CatherineWell, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called ‘Talk to me London’ has created these ‘Tubechat’ badges that you can wear to show that you’re happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one! NeilYeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don’t know what might happen. CatherineThat’s true. Now, let’s listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places. Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UKWhen we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us – we’re just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We’re persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It’s a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we’re going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other. CatherineDr Elle Boag there. And hyper vigilance means being extremely watchful of what’s going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you’re just one person in a crowd of others and you just don’t know who might be dangerous. NeilYeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour. CatherineThat’s right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become insular – which means inward looking. NeilIt sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous – to blend in with the crowd – and not have to talk to people! CatherineWell, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic – which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can’t do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours. NeilAnd a nosey person shows too much interest in other people’s business. CatherineNow, it’s good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it’s not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting – it’s about efficiency – getting to work on time, getting things done. Let’s hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this. Thomas Farley, writer and broadcasterThe cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it’s a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don’t have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it’s not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose – it’s simply that people have a destination to be. NeilSo what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine? CatherineSuccess quotient means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients. NeilCities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine? CatherineI don’t think we hustle, Neil. Hustle means to work aggressively to make money. NeilWe do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And chitchat, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That’s what we do! CatherineWhat we do isn’t chitchat, Neil! It’s highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today’s quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin? NeilAnd it’s a) melatonin – I’m absolutely sure. CatherineSorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin – a hormone commonly known as the ‘love drug’. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment. NeilNow, here are the words we learned today: hyper vigilance insular claustrophobic nosey quotient hustle chitchat CatherineThat’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to join us again soon! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine…您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning!我是 Neil。你知道吗，凯瑟琳，今天早上有人在地铁上和我说话了！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)No, really?不，真的吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah.是的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Wow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don’t know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say?哇！我也许应该指出，在地铁上与你不认识的人交谈在伦敦是相当不寻常的行为！那么，尼尔，他们怎么说呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London – something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone.嗯，他们说今天是多么美好的一天，很高兴看到阳光明媚地照耀着伦敦 —— 类似这样。但实际上，聊天而不是皱着眉头坐在那里摆弄我的手机是件好事。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Which is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil.尼尔，你可能总是这样做来在公共交通工具上打发时间。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking… if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don’t I – and other commuters in the city – do it more often?是的，是的 - 我和其他成千上万的人。但这让我思考……如果在上班路上与人交谈让我感觉更好，那么我和城市中的其他通勤者为什么不更频繁地交谈呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, that’s a good question, Neil, and maybe we’ll find some answers in the show, because today we’re talking about why cities make us so rude. And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin?嗯，这是个好问题，Neil，也许我们会在节目中找到一些答案，因为今天我们要讨论的是为什么城市让我们如此粗鲁。我有一个问题要问你：当我们与某人进行积极的互动时，我们的身体会释放一种化学物质。但是这种化学物质叫什么名字呢？是吗。。。a） 褪黑激素？b） 催产素？或 c） 甲状腺素？ Neil(尼尔)I don’t know, but I’m going to say a) melatonin.我不知道，但我要说的是 a） 褪黑激素。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called ‘Talk to me London’ has created these ‘Tubechat’ badges that you can wear to show that you’re happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one!好吧，我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。但是你知道吗，Neil，一个名为 “Talk to me London” 的组织创造了这些 “Tubechat” 徽章，你可以佩戴这些徽章来表明你很乐意与陌生人交谈。也许你应该买一个！ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don’t know what might happen.是的，也许我应该这样做。但问题是，大城市的人们经常害怕与陌生人开始交谈，因为你不知道会发生什么。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s true. Now, let’s listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places.这是真的。现在，让我们听听英国伯明翰城市大学的社会心理学家 Elle Boag 博士的演讲。她同意人们可以将城市视为具有威胁性的地方。 Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK(ElleBoag博士，英国伯明翰城市大学社会心理学家)When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us – we’re just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We’re persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It’s a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we’re going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other.当我们走下地铁或走上拥挤的城市街道时，我们的大脑会对周围威胁的感知变得高度警惕 —— 我们只是一大群人中的一个小人物。这会导致孤立和防御的行为。我们一直在寻找周围的潜在威胁，这使得我们不再进行眼神交流，这将降低任何人打招呼的可能性。这是一种保护机制，我们可以在前往目的地的旅程中幸存下来，这使得我们听起来对彼此都非常粗鲁。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Dr Elle Boag there. And hyper vigilance means being extremely watchful of what’s going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you’re just one person in a crowd of others and you just don’t know who might be dangerous.Elle Boag 博士在那里。高度警惕意味着要非常警惕周围发生的事情。人们的行为可能不可预测，就像 Boag 博士所说，你只是一群人中的一个人，你只是不知道谁可能是危险的。 Neil(尼尔)Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.是的，我明白你的意思。事实上，我们一直在寻找潜在的威胁，嗯，它会影响我们的行为。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become insular – which means inward looking.没错。作为一种保护机制，我们避免与他人交谈或眼神交流。因此，我们变得狭隘 – 这意味着向内看。 Neil(尼尔)It sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous – to blend in with the crowd – and not have to talk to people!听起来很糟糕！但实际上，我认识一些人搬到伦敦，是为了保持匿名 —— 融入人群 —— 而不必与人交谈！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic – which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can’t do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours.好吧，如果你在一个小镇长大，它可能会让人感到幽闭恐惧症 —— 这意味着没有足够的空间来感到舒适。你知道，如果整个社区都不知道，你就不能做任何事情。你可能有爱管闲事的邻居。 Neil(尼尔)And a nosey person shows too much interest in other people’s business.而一个爱管闲事的人对别人的事情表现出太大的兴趣。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, it’s good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it’s not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting – it’s about efficiency – getting to work on time, getting things done. Let’s hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this.现在，最好指出生活在城市的人们有事情要做。阻止人们聊天的不一定是粗鲁 —— 这是关于效率的 —— 准时上班，完成工作。让我们听听作家、广播员、礼仪专家 Thomas Farley 的意见，以了解更多信息。 Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster(ThomasFarley，作家和广播员)The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it’s a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don’t have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it’s not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose – it’s simply that people have a destination to be.城市的生活成本更高，成功商数更高，这是一个你努力生存的地方，如果你不努力，我的意思是，从字面上和比喻上讲，你无法生存和繁荣。所以我们通常没有太多时间闲聊。我认为我们都需要注意，这不是故意的无视或故意粗鲁的人 —— 这只是人们有一个目的地。 Neil(尼尔)So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?那么，凯瑟琳，托马斯·法利 （Thomas Farley） 所说的成功商数是什么意思呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Success quotient means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients.成功商数是指相对于普通人，你在工作中取得成功的能力，托马斯·法利 （Thomas Farley） 说，在城市里，人们的成功商数更高。 Neil(尼尔)Cities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?城市也是竞争激烈的地方，因此人们必须努力生存。我们忙碌吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I don’t think we hustle, Neil. Hustle means to work aggressively to make money.我不认为我们很忙，Neil。Hustle 的意思是积极工作以赚钱。 Neil(尼尔)We do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And chitchat, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That’s what we do!不过，我们确实有足够的时间闲聊。顺便说一句，闲聊的意思是不重要的对话。这就是我们所做的！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)What we do isn’t chitchat, Neil! It’s highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today’s quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin?我们所做的不是闲聊，尼尔！它信息量很大，具有指导意义！现在，我认为是时候听听今天测验的答案了。你还记得吗，我问道：当我们与某人进行积极的互动时，我们的身体会释放一种化学物质。这种化学物质叫什么名字？是吗。。。a） 褪黑激素？b） 催产素？或 c） 甲状腺素？ Neil(尼尔)And it’s a) melatonin – I’m absolutely sure.它是 a） 褪黑激素 – 我绝对确定。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin – a hormone commonly known as the ‘love drug’. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment.不好意思！正确答案是 b） 催产素 – 一种通常被称为“爱情药物”的激素。它减少了恐惧，增加了人与人之间的信任，并唤起了满足感。 Neil(尼尔)Now, here are the words we learned today: hyper vigilance insular claustrophobic nosey quotient hustle chitchat现在，这是我们今天学到的单词： 高度警惕 孤立 幽闭恐惧症 爱管闲事 商数 喧嚣 闲聊 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

NeilWell, we’ll talk more about that later in the show, but I should say at this point that today we’re discussing genealogy – or the study of family history. And I think it’s pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme Who do you think you are, Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history? CatherineYeah, I’ve seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity – who was very proud of his working class London roots – or origins – discovered that he’s actually a direct descendent of an English king! NeilWell, that’s quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn’t anything exciting in your family history – no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet… CatherineWell, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there’s always something exciting or unexpected in anybody’s family history. And skeletons in the closet by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it’s time for today’s quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to decipher – or understand. So what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology? NeilWell, it must be a) Scriptography. CatherineAnd we’ll see if you’re right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity? NeilWell, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story – especially if it’s connected with our own family. And these days, it’s easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online. CatherineBBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he’s talking about his great-grandfather’s story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents! INSERTMike Williams, BBC presenter The Williamses are my father’s side and on my mother’s the Heino’s – it’s a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here – it’s a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father – the head of the household – Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family lore has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool. NeilWhat’s a census, Catherine? CatherineIt’s an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams’s great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland. NeilThe exciting event in Mike Williams’ history – passed down through family lore – which means ‘knowledge passed on from one generation to the next’ – is that his great-grandfather jumped ship. CatherineWhich means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so. NeilAnd he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories – sometimes without knowing it. CatherineActually that’s something that many people are fascinated by – and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars. NeilAnd then they come up with results saying you’re related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt… Remember I said that we were related? Well, let’s now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant. INSERTElse Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London There’s what you might call the ‘gateway ancestor’ – and the idea of history and genealogy is that’s normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known – in England it’s something like Edward III. And we’re all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that’s where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other. CatherineElse Churchill says it’s likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you’re related to Edward III is a waste of money. NeilYes, in the sense that it’s you and millions of other people. And in fact, we’re all related to each other somehow, via Edward III or someone else. CatherineAnd another popular finding for British people is to say that you’re descended from the Vikings, and again this is true for many people so it isn’t particularly meaningful. NeilIf you’re descended from a person or a group it means they are among your ancestors. CatherineNow, remember I asked: what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology? NeilI said a) Scriptography. And I’m pretty confident that’s the right answer. CatherineWell, Neil, you’re pretty confident but unfortunately it was wrong! The correct answer is b) Palaeography. Palaeography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts. NeilOh well, here are the words we learned: genealogy roots skeletons in the closet decipher census family lore descended from CatherineAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to join us again soon! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine…您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Do you realise, Catherine, that we are related to each other?我是 Neil。凯瑟琳，你意识到我们是彼此相关的吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Don’t be silly, Neil. I think I’d know if you were in my family.别傻了，尼尔。我想我会知道你是否在我家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll talk more about that later in the show, but I should say at this point that today we’re discussing genealogy – or the study of family history. And I think it’s pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme Who do you think you are, Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?好吧，我们将在节目后面详细讨论这个问题，但我想说的是，今天我们讨论的是家谱 —— 或者说家族史的研究。我认为这是非常有趣的东西。你有没有看过电视节目《你觉得你是谁，凯瑟琳》？你知道吗，名人在哪里了解他们的家族历史？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yeah, I’ve seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity – who was very proud of his working class London roots – or origins – discovered that he’s actually a direct descendent of an English king!是的，我见过几个。例如，一位名人 - 他对自己的工人阶级伦敦根源或出身感到非常自豪 - 发现他实际上是英国国王的直系后裔！ Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn’t anything exciting in your family history – no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet…嗯，这真是一个了不起的发现！但问题是，凯瑟琳，如果你的家族历史中没有任何令人兴奋的事情 —— 没有谜团，壁橱里没有骷髅 —— 该怎么办…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there’s always something exciting or unexpected in anybody’s family history. And skeletons in the closet by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it’s time for today’s quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to decipher – or understand. So what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology?好吧，我想如果你追溯得足够远，尼尔，任何人的家族历史中总会有一些令人兴奋或意想不到的事情。顺便说一句，壁橱里的骷髅意味着秘密！现在，我认为是时候回答今天的测验问题了。研究家族史通常涉及阅读旧文件，例如出生证明、结婚证和死亡证明，这些文件可能难以破译或理解。那么，古代笔迹研究的名称是什么呢？是吗。。。a） 剧本？b） 古文字学？或者 c） 抄写学？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it must be a) Scriptography.嗯，它必须是 a） 剧本学。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we’ll see if you’re right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity?我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。现在，你认为为什么大多数人都会查看他们的家谱，尼尔？只是好奇吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story – especially if it’s connected with our own family. And these days, it’s easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online.好吧，凯瑟琳，我们都喜欢一个好的悬疑故事 —— 尤其是当它与我们自己的家庭有关时。如今，在线研究很容易，因为许多旧的纸质文档已经数字化并且可以在线访问。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)BBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he’s talking about his great-grandfather’s story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents!BBC 主持人迈克·威廉姆斯 （Mike Williams） 调查了他自己的家族史。在这里，他谈论的是他曾祖父的故事。如果你仔细听，你可以听到他沙沙作响的真实纸质文件！ INSERT(插入)Mike Williams, BBC presenter The Williamses are my father’s side and on my mother’s the Heino’s – it’s a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here – it’s a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father – the head of the household – Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family lore has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool.Mike Williams，BBC 主持人 Williamses 是我父亲的一方，而我母亲是 Heino 一家 —— 我们认为这个名字来自芬兰。如果我在这里看这份文件 —— 它是 1911 年英格兰和威尔士人口普查的副本 —— 你可以看到我的祖父、儿子和他的父亲 —— 一家之主 —— 迈克尔·海诺，或者米歇尔·海诺，家族传说中，他跳槽并最终来到了利物浦。 Neil(尼尔)What’s a census, Catherine?什么是人口普查，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)It’s an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams’s great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland.这是对人口的官方统计。因此，迈克·威廉姆斯的曾祖父出现在 1911 年的英格兰和威尔士人口普查中，但由于他的姓氏，家人认为他可能最初来自芬兰。 Neil(尼尔)The exciting event in Mike Williams’ history – passed down through family lore – which means ‘knowledge passed on from one generation to the next’ – is that his great-grandfather jumped ship.迈克·威廉姆斯 （Mike Williams） 历史上激动人心的事件 —— 通过家族传说流传下来 —— 意思是“知识代代相传” —— 是他的曾祖父跳槽了。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Which means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so.这意味着他在未经允许的情况下离开了他正在工作的船。 Neil(尼尔)And he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories – sometimes without knowing it.他在英国开始了新的生活。我想相当多的人在他们的家族历史中都有移民故事 —— 有时他们并不知道。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Actually that’s something that many people are fascinated by – and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars.实际上，这是许多人着迷的事情 —— 而且现在公司以低至 100 美元的价格提供测试唾液中的 DNA 也变得更容易调查。 Neil(尼尔)And then they come up with results saying you’re related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt… Remember I said that we were related? Well, let’s now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant.然后他们得出的结果说你和亚历山大大帝或布拉德皮特有关系……还记得我说过我们是亲戚吗？好吧，现在让我们听听伦敦系谱学家协会的 Else Churchill 的演讲，他解释了我的意思。 INSERT(插入)Else Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London There’s what you might call the ‘gateway ancestor’ – and the idea of history and genealogy is that’s normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known – in England it’s something like Edward III. And we’re all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that’s where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other.Else Churchill，系谱学家协会，伦敦 你可以称之为“门户祖先” —— 历史和家谱学的概念通常是有据可查的人，他们的后代是众所周知的 —— 在英国，它就像爱德华三世。我们很可能都是爱德华三世的后裔。有皇室祖先是不是很好？嗯，数以百万计的人是爱德华三世的后裔，所以从这个意义上说，这可能就是联系所在。因此，很可能很多人彼此之间有很远的联系。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Else Churchill says it’s likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you’re related to Edward III is a waste of money.埃尔斯·丘吉尔说，我们数百万人很可能与像英格兰国王爱德华三世这样的门户祖先有远亲关系。这意味着所有与爱德华三世有关的人也彼此之间有远亲关系。所以看来，付给一家公司一百美元来透露你和爱德华三世有关系是浪费钱。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, in the sense that it’s you and millions of other people. And in fact, we’re all related to each other somehow, via Edward III or someone else.是的，从某种意义上说，这是您和数百万其他人。事实上，我们都以某种方式通过爱德华三世或其他人彼此联系在一起。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And another popular finding for British people is to say that you’re descended from the Vikings, and again this is true for many people so it isn’t particularly meaningful.英国人的另一个流行发现是说你是维京人的后裔，这对许多人来说都是如此，所以这并不是特别有意义。 Neil(尼尔)If you’re descended from a person or a group it means they are among your ancestors.如果你是某个人或某个群体的后裔，那就意味着他们是你的祖先。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, remember I asked: what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology?现在，记得我问过：古代笔迹研究的名字是什么？是吗。。。a） 剧本？b） 古文字学？或者 c） 抄写学？ Neil(尼尔)I said a) Scriptography.

Palaeography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.好吧，尼尔，你很有信心，但不幸的是，你错了！正确答案是 b） 古文字学。古文字学是对古代和历史笔迹的研究，包括破译、阅读和确定历史手稿年代的实践。 Neil(尼尔)Oh well, here are the words we learned: genealogy roots skeletons in the closet decipher census family lore descended from哦，好吧，这是我们学到的单词：家谱根源 壁橱里的骨骼破译了人口普查家族传说的后代 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

NeilWell, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach with a cool breeze. I don’t like when it’s too hot. AliceYes, true. Humans don’t cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today’s show is extremophiles – these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake. NeilThose do sound like pretty extreme conditions. AliceYes. The thing is, what sounds hostile – or unfriendly – to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn’t survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today’s quiz question, Neil? NeilI think so. AliceAlright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to geysers – or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air – which have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon? b) Death Valley National Park? Or c) Yellowstone? NeilThat’s easy - it has to be c) Yellowstone. AliceOK, well we’ll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants? NeilNo. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren’t they? AliceYes, that’s true. But remember, extremophiles are microorganisms – they’re really tiny. Let’s listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called ‘archaea’ – meaning ‘ancient ones’. The extremophiles belong to this group. INSERTIan Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say ‘that’s all wrong – there’s really only three major groups in life: there’s the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life’; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe. NeilSo botany is the study of plant life, and zoology is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain ‘archaea’, and ‘eukaryotes’, Alice. AliceArchaea are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. Eukaryote is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell– and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi. NeilBut why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi? AliceWell, Neil, it’s likely they’ve have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable – and that’s billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today. NeilAnd when something is thriving it means it’s doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice. AliceSome live in hydrothermal vents – holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there’s lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth’s crust and then flowing out through these holes. NeilI see… Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles? AliceWell, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water. NeilAnd how do they survive down there? AliceWell, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water. NeilThat sounds clever for a microbe – how did they figure that out? AliceIt isn’t a question of cleverness - it’s a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let’s hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London. INSERTNick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals. NeilSo, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom. AliceIndeed. And now it’s time for the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone? NeilAnd I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right. AliceYes, Neil, you are right - it’s Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone’s hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth. NeilVery interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today: extremophiles hostile geysers microorganisms botany zoology archaea eukaryote thriving hydrothermal vents AliceAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I don’t like when it’s too hot.嗯，对我来说，躺在热带海滩上棕榈树下的吊床上，微风拂面。我不喜欢太热的时候。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, true. Humans don’t cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today’s show is extremophiles – these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake.是的，确实如此。人类不能很好地应对极端温度，但有些物种可以。今天节目的主题是极端微生物 —— 这些微生物已经适应了生活在我们认为是极端条件下的微生物。例如，生活在接近沸腾的酸性水中或在南极湖底部结冰。 Neil(尼尔)Those do sound like pretty extreme conditions.这些听起来确实是相当极端的情况。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes. The thing is, what sounds hostile – or unfriendly – to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn’t survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today’s quiz question, Neil?是的。问题是，对我们来说听起来充满敌意或不友好的是极端微生物的完美环境，事实上，没有它们它们就无法生存。现在，尼尔，你有足够的勇气来面对今天的测验问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)I think so.我认为如此。 Alice(爱丽丝)Alright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to geysers – or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air – which have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon? b) Death Valley National Park?

But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants?好的，我们会在节目的后面看看你是否得到了正确的答案。但是，继续说下去，现在，尼尔，你知道极端微生物与其他动物和植物属于完全不同的生物群吗？ Neil(尼尔)No. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren’t they?不。我想象极端微生物会像昆虫一样，因为昆虫很坚韧，不是吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, that’s true. But remember, extremophiles are microorganisms – they’re really tiny. Let’s listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called ‘archaea’ – meaning ‘ancient ones’. The extremophiles belong to this group.是的，这是真的。但请记住，极端微生物是微生物 —— 它们真的很小。让我们听听伦敦伯贝克大学行星科学和天体生物学教授伊恩·克劳福德 （Ian Crawford） 的演讲。他告诉我们，在 1970 年代，一位名叫 Carl Woese 的科学家如何确定了一个新的生物王国，他称之为“古细菌” —— 意思是“古老的”。极端微生物属于这一组。 INSERT(插入)Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say ‘that’s all wrong – there’s really only three major groups in life: there’s the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life’; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe.伊恩·克劳福德（Ian Crawford），伦敦伯贝克大学行星科学和天体生物学教授嗯，古老的生命之树概念基本上是关于帝国，如果你愿意的话，植物、动物，以及我们可以看到的事物。我们非常重视大型生物以及植物学和动物学在生物学中的传统区别。它真正做的是说“这都是错误的 —— 生命中实际上只有三个主要群体：古细菌、细菌和真核生物，它们就是所有这些复杂的生命”；所以它有点把人类放在生命之树的一个小角落里，旁边是植物和其他任何东西。在成为宇宙的中心之后，它又一次压制了我们。 Neil(尼尔)So botany is the study of plant life, and zoology is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain ‘archaea’, and ‘eukaryotes’, Alice.所以植物学是对植物生命的研究，而动物学是对动物生命的研究。但也许你可以解释“古细菌”和“真核生物”，爱丽丝。 Alice(爱丽丝)Archaea are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. Eukaryote is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell– and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi.古细菌是一组单细胞微生物，类似于细菌，但与所有其他已知类型不同。真核生物是具有更大、更复杂的细胞类型的生物的科学术语 —— 该组包括所有动物、植物和真菌。 Neil(尼尔)But why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi?但为什么古细菌如此重要呢？为什么他们需要属于自己的整个生物领域，而我们人类却被植物和真菌挤在一个领域？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, Neil, it’s likely they’ve have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable – and that’s billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today.嗯，尼尔，自从地球变得宜居以来，它们很可能就一直生活在我们的星球上 —— 那是数十亿年。今天，它们仍然在各种不同的环境中生活和繁荣。 Neil(尼尔)And when something is thriving it means it’s doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice.当某样东西蓬勃发展时，意味着它做得很好！那么，告诉我们他们住在哪里，Alice。 Alice(爱丽丝)Some live in hydrothermal vents – holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there’s lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth’s crust and then flowing out through these holes.有些生活在热液喷口中，即海底数百米深的洞，那里有很大的压力，没有阳光。富含矿物质的过热水从地壳中流出，然后通过这些空洞流出。 Neil(尼尔)I see… Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles?明白了。。。那么，爱寒的极端微生物呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water.嗯，科学家们在南极洲数百米厚的冰盖下的隐藏湖泊中发现了它们。钻穿冰层到达水面需要几天时间。 Neil(尼尔)And how do they survive down there?他们又是如何在那儿生存的呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water.嗯，这些微生物已经找到了一种从水中的某些矿物质（如铁和硫）中获取能量的方法。 Neil(尼尔)That sounds clever for a microbe – how did they figure that out?对于微生物来说，这听起来很聪明 —— 他们是怎么弄清楚的呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)It isn’t a question of cleverness - it’s a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let’s hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London.这不是一个聪明的问题 —— 这是一个适应的问题。极端微生物对环境的适应能力极强，它们比更复杂的生命形式更早出现在地球上。让我们听听伦敦大学学院进化生物化学读者 Nick Lane 的演讲。 INSERT(插入)Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals.Nick Lane，伦敦大学学院进化生物化学读者真核细胞的起源，似乎发生过一次，大约花了 20 亿年才发生。然后，在细胞水平上出现了巨大的飞跃，但又过了十亿年，我们才看到动物。 Neil(尼尔)So, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom.所以，基本上，动物界比古宙界要新得多。 Alice(爱丽丝)Indeed. And now it’s time for the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone?事实上。现在是回答今天测验问题的时候了，Neil。我问：美国哪个国家公园是间歇泉的所在地，其中生活着极端微生物？是吗。。。a） 大峡谷，b） 死亡谷国家公园还是 c） 黄石公园？ Neil(尼尔)And I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right.我说 c） 黄石公园。我一定是对的。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, Neil, you are right - it’s Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone’s hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth.是的，Neil，你说得对 - 这是黄石国家公园。每年，科学家们都会在黄石公园的温泉中发现非凡的新微生物，对医学、农业和能源产生影响，并为地球上最早生命的形成提供线索。 Neil(尼尔)Very interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today: extremophiles hostile geysers microorganisms botany zoology archaea eukaryote thriving hydrothermal vents非常有趣。现在，以下是我们今天听到的词： 极端微生物 敌对间歇泉 微生物 植物学 动物学 古细菌 真核生物 繁荣的热液喷口 Alice(爱丽丝)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Neil… AliceAnd I’m Alice. So Neil, the subject of today’s show is superheroes! Who’s your favourite? NeilSpiderman. He’s cool and funny – and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers! AliceWell, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel. NeilI’ve never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes. AliceWell, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to. And they’re hungry for characters a little closer to home – or relevant to their own lives. NeilSo what’s Ms Marvel’s super power? AliceShe’s a shape shifter – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she’s also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim. NeilIt sounds good. But I think it must be time for today’s quiz question, Alice! AliceOK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster? NeilI’m going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man. AliceWell, we’ll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both contaminated – or poisoned – by radioactive substances that change their DNA. NeilWhat about Batman and Iron Man? They’re just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves. AliceGood point. There don’t seem to be any hard-and-fast – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it’s being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books. NeilThat’s true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often blur the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me. AliceLet’s hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London. INSERTJason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to. NeilSo publishers – like Marvel Comics – imbued – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can’t imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife! AliceAnd bickering means arguing about things that aren’t important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse – or varied – readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home. NeilI know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they’ve been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing. AliceWell, it isn’t. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the manga – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there. NeilReally? AliceYes. Let’s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga. INSERTDr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it’s one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority. NeilDr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK. AliceIt’s particularly interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan. NeilAnd do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman? AliceNo. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let’s go to today’s quiz question. I asked you: what’s the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster? NeilAnd I said Miles Morales. AliceAnd you were… wrong, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor’s hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel. NeilVery interesting. Now, let’s remind ourselves of the words we learned today: closer to home shape shifter contaminated hard and fast blur imbued bicker diverse manga autonomous AliceAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

So Neil, the subject of today’s show is superheroes! Who’s your favourite?我是 Alice。所以 Neil，今天节目的主题是超级英雄！你最喜欢谁？ Neil(尼尔)Spiderman. He’s cool and funny – and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers!蜘蛛侠。他很酷，很有趣 —— 他可以织网和从摩天大楼上跳下来！ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel.嗯，我最喜欢的超级英雄是惊奇女士。 Neil(尼尔)I’ve never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.我从来没有听说过她 —— 而且我有点像漫画超级英雄方面的专家。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to. And they’re hungry for characters a little closer to home – or relevant to their own lives.好吧，越来越多的来自不同种族背景的人对所有这些他们无法与之产生共鸣的白人男性超级英雄感到厌倦。他们渴望更贴近家庭或与他们自己的生活相关的角色。 Neil(尼尔)So what’s Ms Marvel’s super power?那么惊奇女士的超能力是什么呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)She’s a shape shifter – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she’s also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.她是一个变形者 —— 这意味着她可以改变形状并成为她想要的任何东西。但她也只是卡玛拉·汗（Kamala Khan），一个来自新泽西州的普通青少年，恰好是亚裔和穆斯林。 Neil(尼尔)It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today’s quiz question, Alice!听起来不错。但我认为今天一定是问答问题的时候了，Alice！ Alice(爱丽丝)OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster?好，就在这里。取代托尼·斯塔克饰演钢铁侠的新角色叫什么名字？是吗。。。a） 迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯？b） 里里·威廉姆斯？或者 c） 简·福斯特？ Neil(尼尔)I’m going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.我要说 a） 迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯，因为他听起来像个男人。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, we’ll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both contaminated – or poisoned – by radioactive substances that change their DNA.好吧，我们稍后会在节目中发现您是否回答正确。现在，我有另一个问题。获得超级英雄地位的规则是什么？超人是外星人，惊奇女士有外星基因，蜘蛛侠和绿巨人都被改变 DNA 的放射性物质污染或中毒。 Neil(尼尔)What about Batman and Iron Man? They’re just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.蝙蝠侠和钢铁侠呢？他们只是拥有大量金钱的普通人，利用技术为自己创造超能力。 Alice(爱丽丝)Good point. There don’t seem to be any hard-and-fast – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it’s being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books.说得好。似乎没有任何硬性规定或明确的规定。但这些特殊能力 —— 无论是能够飞行、改变形状还是织网 —— 它们都让角色在世界上做好事。这是所有漫画书的一个大主题。 Neil(尼尔)That’s true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often blur the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.这是真的。但时代变了，如今的漫画书经常模糊对与错的界限 —— 让事情变得不清楚。超级英雄并不总是做正确的事情，像你我一样与日常问题作斗争。 Alice(爱丽丝)Let’s hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London.让我们从伦敦大学学院政治地理学教授 Jason Ditmer 那里更多地了解不完美的超级英雄。 INSERT(插入)Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to.杰森·迪特默（Jason Ditmer），伦敦大学学院政治地理学教授他们 [漫威漫画] 为这些角色注入了真实的人类问题。所以彼得·帕克刚刚，有点……一个接一个的问题。神奇四侠是一个家庭，他们争吵和打架，里德和苏是一对，然后他们结婚了，这在超级英雄漫画中从来没有发生过。所以这些人的生活让其他人可以感同身受。 Neil(尼尔)So publishers – like Marvel Comics – imbued – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can’t imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife!因此，出版商 —— 比如漫威漫画 —— 将人性问题灌输或填充到他们的角色中。我无法想象像美国队长这样的角色会为小事担心 —— 或者和他的妻子争吵！ Alice(爱丽丝)And bickering means arguing about things that aren’t important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse – or varied – readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home.而争吵意味着为不重要的事情争论。嗯，就像你之前说的，时代在变化，Neil。如今，出版社希望吸引更多样化或多样化的读者群：青少年、女性、少数民族 —— 他们希望有与自己产生共鸣的超级英雄，面临从种族歧视到家庭争吵等问题。 Neil(尼尔)I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they’ve been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.我知道女性确实对超级英雄感兴趣，因为她们一直出现在电影和电视上，但漫画书的世界一直有点像男人。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, it isn’t. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the manga – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there.嗯，不是。女性阅读它们，在某些地方，女性在其中工作。例如，在日本，我们有漫画 —— 这些是成人和儿童的日本漫画书。而且，你猜怎么着 —— 那里有很强的女性插画家传统。 Neil(尼尔)Really?真？ Alice(爱丽丝)Yes. Let’s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.是的。现在让我们继续前进，听听伦敦城市大学（City University）的社会学家凯西·布里恩扎（Casey Brienza）博士谈论漫画。 INSERT(插入)Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it’s one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority.Casey Brienza 博士，伦敦城市大学社会学家在日本制作漫画真正有趣的事情之一是，它是女性可以拥有的少数自主职业之一。因此，日本有很多很多女性漫画家，她们为男性、女性、男孩和女孩写作。在美国和英国，女性漫画家无疑是少数。 Neil(尼尔)Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.Casey Brienza 博士在那里。所以她说，女性漫画家在日本很常见，但在美国和英国却是少数。 Alice(爱丽丝)It’s particularly interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan.特别有趣的是，成为一名艺术家是一个自主的职业–这意味着你可以自由地做出自己的决定–显然，这对日本女性来说并不常见。 Neil(尼尔)And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?你知道谁画了惊奇女士吗？是女性吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let’s go to today’s quiz question. I asked you: what’s the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams?

AliceAn autonomous – or independent and driverless – car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. I think they’re a great idea. NeilAnd navigate means’ to find the way to get to a place’. I’m not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall. AliceMaybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error, and human error means ‘the mistakes we make because we’re human’. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk – or distracted. NeilBehind the wheel: in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road. AliceThey are being irresponsible drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today’s show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300? b) 3,000? Or c) 30,000? NeilAnd I’m going to say b) 3,000. AliceWell, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil? NeilNo, I’m not a petrol head – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He’ll answer this question himself. Let’s listen. INSERTEddie Jordan, racing team owner When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I’m now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn’t want to drive and I always felt cheated because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience. NeilEddie Jordan there. And doing something flat out means ‘at maximum capacity’. Do you feel like a different person when you’re driving, Alice? AliceNo. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I’d love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn’t feel cheated of the pleasure of driving! NeilI agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I’m a bit of a backseat driver. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice. AliceWell just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn’t need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely. NeilBut can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions? AliceOverride in this context means ‘to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself’. Airline pilots do that, don’t they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing. NeilI would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to. AliceWell, let’s listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who’s experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained. INSERTBrian Fung, technology reporter Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable. And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that’s one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it’s how mundane it was. NeilBrian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and right off the bat means ‘immediately’. AliceBut he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars. NeilWell, that all sounds very nice, but I think I’d still prefer to be in the driving seat – and that means ‘in control of a situation’. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice. AliceWell, the future is likely to be all about automated transport – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won’t have a choice, Neil. NeilMaybe you’ll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun. AliceMaybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads. NeilI still need some convincing. And that brings us back to today’s quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice? AliceOf course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000? NeilAnd I said 3,000. AliceAnd unfortunately Neil that’s right! Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. That’s according to Annual Global Road Crash Statistics.

I think they’re a great idea.自动驾驶或独立无人驾驶汽车是指能够在无需人工输入的情况下感知环境并导航的车辆。我认为他们是个好主意。 Neil(尼尔)And navigate means’ to find the way to get to a place’. I’m not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.导航的意思是“找到到达某个地方的路”。我不确定我是否会相信计算机会驱动我。它可能会出错并撞到墙上。 Alice(爱丽丝)Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error, and human error means ‘the mistakes we make because we’re human’. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk – or distracted.也许吧，但实际上大多数车祸都涉及人为错误的因素，而人为错误是指“因为我们是人而犯的错误”。例如，在疲倦或醉酒或分心时开车的人。 Neil(尼尔)Behind the wheel: in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road.在方向盘后面：换句话说，控制一辆汽车。是的，我经常看到人们用手机或短信聊天，而不是看路。 Alice(爱丽丝)They are being irresponsible drivers, Neil.

Are you a petrol head, Neil?好吧，我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。你是汽油迷吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)No, I’m not a petrol head – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He’ll answer this question himself. Let’s listen.不，我不是一个汽油迷 —— 我是一个热爱汽车和驾驶的人。但我知道赛车队老板 Eddie Jordan 是。他喜欢开车的什么地方？他会自己回答这个问题。让我们倾听。 INSERT(插入)Eddie Jordan, racing team owner When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I’m now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn’t want to drive and I always felt cheated because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience.Eddie Jordan，赛车队老板当我坐上一辆车时，我感觉自己变了一个人，我觉得我现在掌控一切。我可以打开音乐，也可以关闭它。我可以做各种我感觉良好的不同事情。当我在 Jordan 团队全力以赴时，我确实有一名车手，他能够打电话、接电话、能够在车里工作，不是因为我不想开车，我总是觉得被骗了，因为那里有一位车手享受了我本应拥有的乐趣。所以当我坐上车时，它必须是一次有趣的经历。 Neil(尼尔)Eddie Jordan there. And doing something flat out means ‘at maximum capacity’. Do you feel like a different person when you’re driving, Alice?埃迪乔丹在那里。全力以赴意味着“以最大容量”。爱丽丝，当你开车时，你觉得自己变了一个人吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)No. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I’d love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn’t feel cheated of the pleasure of driving!不。而且 —— 与 Eddie Jordan 不同 —— 就此而言，我很想拥有一辆司机或无人驾驶汽车。它让你有时间做其他事情，比如完成一些工作。我当然不会觉得被驾驶的乐趣所欺骗！ Neil(尼尔)I agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I’m a bit of a backseat driver. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.我同意 Eddie Jordan 的观点。我会觉得有点被骗了。我不得不承认：我有点像后座司机。我坐在副驾驶座上，给司机一些不需要的建议。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn’t need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.好吧，Neil，想想看，在无人驾驶汽车中，你不需要给计算机建议，因为它会做出正确的决定，让你安全地到达目的地。 Neil(尼尔)But can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions?但是你能覆盖计算机吗？你知道，如果你觉得它做出了错误的决定？ Alice(爱丽丝)Override in this context means ‘to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself’. Airline pilots do that, don’t they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing.在此上下文中，Override 的意思是 “通过自己控制来停止自动作”。航空公司的飞行员就是这样做的，不是吗？他们在大部分旅程中都以自动驾驶仪飞行，但为了控制飞机的起飞和降落，他们超越了自动驾驶仪。 Neil(尼尔)I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.如果我愿意，如果我能收回对自动驾驶汽车的控制权，我会感到更快乐。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, let’s listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who’s experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained.好吧，现在让我们听听科技记者 Brian Fung 的演讲，他体验了在无人驾驶汽车中的感觉，没有方向盘、没有制动踏板、没有紧急制动、没有换档器。谷歌正在开发一款汽车，其中一切都将是独立的。 INSERT(插入)Brian Fung, technology reporter Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable. And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that’s one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it’s how mundane it was.Brian Fung，科技记者 嗯，你马上注意到的最重要的事情是，这辆车的加速可能比普通汽车更激进一点，刹车也比普通汽车更激进一点，但除此之外，你需要大约 10 秒才能适应。而且这辆车知道如何在红灯时停下来；它知道如何闯黄灯，可以检测行人并在停放的汽车周围导航。总而言之，感觉与普通的汽车驾驶体验非常相似。我认为这是它最令人惊讶和令人兴奋的事情之一 —— 它是多么平凡。 Neil(尼尔)Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and right off the bat means ‘immediately’.Brian Fung 说，他立即注意到 Google 汽车的加速和制动比普通汽车更激进 —— 马上就意味着“立即”。 Alice(爱丽丝)But he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars.但他也表示，他只花了 10 秒钟就适应了它并感到舒适，因为汽车可以适当地导航并响应不同的交通情况，包括行人和停放的汽车。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I’d still prefer to be in the driving seat – and that means ‘in control of a situation’. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice.嗯，这听起来很不错，但我想我仍然更喜欢坐在驾驶座上 —— 这意味着“掌控局势”。你可以坐那辆无人驾驶的车，去做你的工作吧，爱丽丝。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won’t have a choice, Neil.好吧，未来很可能都是关于自动化运输的 - 飞机、火车、公共汽车和汽车 - 你根本别无选择，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)Maybe you’ll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun.也许你会被允许租一辆可以自己驾驶的汽车，只是为了好玩。 Alice(爱丽丝)Maybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads.或。但我喜欢未来拥有安全无人驾驶道路的想法。 Neil(尼尔)I still need some convincing. And that brings us back to today’s quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice?我还需要一些说服力。这让我们回到了今天的测验问题。现在，您能告诉我们答案吗，爱丽丝？ Alice(爱丽丝)Of course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000?我当然可以！我问道：平均而言，全世界每天大约有多少人死于交通事故？是吗。。。a） 300，b） 3,000 还是 c） 30,000？ Neil(尼尔)And I said 3,000.我说 3,000 人。 Alice(爱丽丝)And unfortunately Neil that’s right! Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. That’s according to Annual Global Road Crash Statistics.不幸的是，尼尔，没错！每年有近 130 万人死于道路交通事故，平均每天有 3,287 人死亡。这是根据年度全球道路交通事故统计数据得出的。 Neil(尼尔)Now, here are the words we learned today: autonomous navigate human error behind the wheel petrol head flat out backseat driver override right off the bat in the driving seat现在，以下是我们今天学到的单词： 自主导航 方向盘后面的人为错误 汽油头 后座驾驶员立即在驾驶座上超控 Alice(爱丽丝)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.
