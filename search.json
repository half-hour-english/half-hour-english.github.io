Good to see you all.大家下午好。很高興見到大家。The thoughts and prayers of the entire White House remain with all of the Catholics around the world整個白宮的思想和祈禱與全世界所有天主教徒同在，who are mourning the death of Pope Francis.他們正在哀悼教皇方濟各的逝世。Pope Francis touched millions of lives and dedicated his life to serving the Catholic Church.教皇方濟各觸動了數百萬人的生命，並將自己的一生奉獻給天主教會。As a mark of respect for his memory, President Trump ordered flags to be flown at half-staff爲了表達對他的敬意，特朗普總統下令降半旗致哀，and he will be traveling to attend his funeral in Rome.他將前往羅馬參加他的葬禮。The President will depart from Washington on Friday morning and return to the United States on Saturday evening following the funeral service.總統將於週五早上離開華盛頓，並在葬禮儀式結束後於週六晚上返回美國。I can also confirm the dates of the President’s trip to the Middle East.我也可以確認總統中東之行的日期。He will travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13th until May 16th.他將於5月13日至5月16日訪問沙特阿拉伯、卡塔爾和阿拉伯聯合酋長國。And on Thursday of this week, President Trump will welcome the Norwegian Prime Minister at the White House for a working visit.本週四，特朗普總統將在白宮歡迎挪威首相進行工作訪問。The two leaders will discuss trade and regional security.兩位領導人將討論貿易和地區安全問題。This will be the 13th head of state visit of President Trump’s term already.這將已經是特朗普總統任期內的第13次國家元首訪問。At the border, President Trump continues to deliver on his promise to make America safe again.在邊境問題上，特朗普總統繼續兌現他讓美國再次安全的承諾。The Wall Street Journal captured the Trump effect in a recent article.《華爾街日報》在最近的一篇文章中捕捉到了特朗普效應。“Border crossings grind to a halt as Trump’s tough policies take hold.”“隨着特朗普強硬政策的實施，邊境過境活動陷於停頓。”U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded its lowest southwest border crossings in history in March,美國海關和邊境保護局記錄到三月份西南邊境過境人數創歷史新低，and we’re seeing the same successes at our northern border.我們在北部邊境也看到了同樣的成功。Here’s how the New York Post put it.《紐約郵報》是這樣報道的。“Northern border sector previously overrun by illegal migrants sees dramatic drop in crossings. We haven’t seen anyone since November.”“先前被非法移民淹沒的北部邊境地區過境人數急劇下降。自十一月以來我們沒見過任何人。”According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, just 54 illegal aliens were apprehended in the Swanton sector of our northern border,根據美國海關和邊境保護局的數據，which stretches more than 300 miles in March.三月份在我們北部邊境綿延超過300英里的斯旺頓地區僅逮捕了54名非法外國人。This is a drastic 95 percent drop from the more than a thousand border crossings that were caught in March 2024.這與2024年3月被捕的超過一千次邊境穿越相比，急劇下降了95%。This was a main hotspot area that recorded more than 80 percent of all apprehensions along the northern border during the 2024 fiscal year.在2024財年，這裏是一個主要熱點地區，記錄了北部邊境所有逮捕人數的80%以上。A new report from the Washington Times fully highlights the difference《華盛頓時報》的一篇新報道充分強調了in Joe Biden’s disgraceful approach to the border compared to President Trump’s.喬·拜登在邊境問題上可恥的做法與特朗普總統做法的不同之處。Under Trump, border catch and release has dropped 99.99% from the worst Biden month.在特朗普治下，邊境抓捕和釋放比拜登最糟糕的月份下降了99.99%。You can’t get much better than that. This statistic in particular is astounding.你不可能做得比這更好了。這個統計數據尤其驚人。Border Patrol agents caught and immediately released 189,604 illegal aliens into the United States in December 2023 at the height of the Biden border crisis.邊境巡邏人員在2023年12月，即拜登邊境危機最嚴重的時候，抓獲並立即釋放了189,604名非法外國人進入美國。But under President Trump, Border Patrol agents caught and released only 20 illegal aliens into the U.S. in the month of February.但在特朗普總統治下，邊境巡邏人員在二月份僅抓獲並釋放了20名非法外國人進入美國。Thanks to President Trump, operational control of the border is becoming a reality感謝特朗普總統，對邊境的有效控制正在成爲現實，and the administration’s historic enforcement measures are yielding huge results.並且本屆政府歷史性的執法措施正在產生巨大成果。Illegal aliens are finally getting the blunt message.非法外國人終於得到了明確的信息。If you cross the border illegally, you will be swiftly deported and never return to the United States of America.如果你非法越境，你將被迅速驅逐出境，並且永遠不得返回美利堅合衆國。Efforts to arrest the criminal illegal alien invaders are continuing to ramp up.逮捕犯罪的非法外來入侵者的努力正在繼續加強。ICE Chicago arrested a Mexican national convicted of predatory sexual assault of a child in Cook County, Illinois.芝加哥移民及海關執法局（ICE）逮捕了一名在伊利諾伊州庫克縣被判對兒童進行掠奪性性侵的墨西哥國民。This week, ICE Denver arrested a Mexican national convicted of sexual assault of a child in Houston County, Texas.本週，丹佛ICE逮捕了一名在德克薩斯州休斯頓縣被判對兒童進行性侵的墨西哥國民。ICE Miami arrested a Nicaraguan convicted of aggravated battery in Hillsborough County, Florida.邁阿密ICE逮捕了一名在佛羅里達州希爾斯伯勒縣被判嚴重毆擊罪的尼加拉瓜人。ICE Houston arrested a Salvadorian national convicted of attempted sexual assault of a child and escape in Dallas County, Texas.休斯頓ICE逮捕了一名在德克薩斯州達拉斯縣被判企圖性侵兒童和越獄罪的薩爾瓦多國民。And ICE Chicago arrested a Mexican national convicted of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor in Illinois.芝加哥ICE逮捕了一名在伊利諾伊州被判嚴重性虐待未成年人的墨西哥國民。Despite the Democrats’ insane objections, President Trump will continue to embolden law enforcement officers儘管民主黨人瘋狂反對，特朗普總統將繼續鼓勵執法人員to arrest dangerous illegal alien criminals and keep our communities safe.逮捕危險的非法外來罪犯並保障我們社區的安全。And also thanks to President Trump’s America First economic approach, investments continue to pour into our country.同樣，得益於特朗普總統的“美國優先”經濟方針，投資繼續涌入我們的國家。A Swiss Pharmaceuticals Company announced it will be investing $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, creating 12,000 new quality jobs.一家瑞士製藥公司宣佈將在未來五年內在美國投資500億美元，創造12,000個新的優質工作崗位。Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also agreed to pay Fujifilm Technologies more than $3 billion over the next decade再生元製藥公司也同意在未來十年內向富士膠片技術公司支付超過30億美元，to help manufacture its medicines in the United States.以幫助在美國生產其藥品。It’s a top priority for President Trump to ensure we are producing critical medicines and pharmaceutical drugs right here in America.確保我們在美國本土生產關鍵藥品和藥物是特朗普總統的首要任務。And that is exactly what we continue to see happen every day.而這正是我們每天繼續看到發生的事情。In other news, the Trump administration has announced we will put an end to Joe Biden’s illegal student loan bailout attempts.另外，特朗普政府已宣佈，我們將終止喬·拜登非法的學生貸款救助嘗試。No student loan has been referred to collections since March of 2020. That comes to an end.自2020年3月以來，沒有任何學生貸款被提交催收。這種情況即將結束。On May 5th, the Department of Education will resume involuntary collections for borrowers with defaulted federal student loans.5月5日，教育部將對拖欠聯邦學生貸款的借款人恢復強制催收。The student loan portfolio controlled by the federal government is nearly $1.6 trillion.聯邦政府控制的學生貸款組合接近1.6萬億美元。But fewer than four out of 10 borrowers are in repayment.但只有不到十分之四的借款人在還款。This is unsustainable, unfair, and a huge liability for American taxpayers.這是不可持續的、不公平的，對美國納稅人來說是一個巨大的負擔。Debt cannot be wiped away. It just ends up getting transferred to others.債務無法被抹去。它最終只是轉移給了其他人。So why should Americans who didn’t go to college or went to college and responsibly paid back their loans那麼，爲什麼沒有上大學，或者上了大學並負責任地償還了貸款的美國人，pay for the student loans of other Americans?要爲其他美國人的學生貸款買單呢？The Trump administration will never force taxpayers to pay student loan debts that don’t belong to them.特朗普政府絕不會強迫納稅人支付不屬於他們的學生貸款債務。Student loan borrowers need clarity, and we’re finally giving it to them.學生貸款借款人需要明確性，我們終於給予了他們。Borrowers will now be clearly expected to repay their loans,現在將明確要求借款人償還貸款，and those who default on their loan obligations will face involuntary collections.而那些拖欠貸款義務的人將面臨強制催收。The government can and will collect defaulted federal student loan debt by withholding money from borrowers’ tax refunds, federal pensions, and even their wages.政府能夠並且將會通過扣留借款人的退稅、聯邦養老金甚至工資來收回拖欠的聯邦學生貸款債務。America is $36 trillion in debt. We must get our fiscal house in order and restore common sense to our country.美國負債高達36萬億美元。我們必須整頓財政秩序，恢復國家的常識。If you take out a loan, you have to pay it back. It’s very simple.如果你借了貸款，你就必須償還。就這麼簡單。President Trump will not kick the can down the road anymore.特朗普總統不會再拖延問題。Before we open it up to questions today, I want to commend our pool photographer who is in the room with us today.在今天開始提問之前，我想表揚一下今天和我們一起在場的我們的攝影記者。ABC News photojournalist Melissa Young is retiring after 44 incredible years on the job, covering the White House.美國廣播公司新聞部的攝影記者梅麗莎·楊在工作了令人難以置信的44年後即將退休，她一直負責報道白宮。Melissa, congratulations. That’s the largest round of applause I’ve ever heard in this room.梅麗莎，恭喜你。這是我在這間屋子裏聽到的最熱烈的掌聲。So there’s something we can all agree on, and it’s that you’ve had an incredible career here covering the White House.所以，有一點我們都能達成共識，那就是你在這裏報道白宮的職業生涯非常精彩。So congratulations to you, and we hope you enjoy retirement. Sure you will.再次恭喜你，我們希望你享受退休生活。相信你會的。And everybody else in the room will be very jealous of you as you’re enjoying your rest.當你享受休息時，房間裏的其他人都會非常嫉妒你。All right, let’s get to it. We have an individual in our new media seat today. His name is Tim Pool.好了，我們開始吧。今天我們的新媒體席位上有位人士。他叫蒂姆·普爾。He’s a political commentator and a media entrepreneur with millions of followers, a very big platform.他是一位政治評論員和媒體企業家，擁有數百萬粉絲，平臺影響力很大。He currently hosts Timcast IRL, a daily news and discussions show,他目前主持每日新聞和討論節目 Timcast IRL，and The Culture War, a weekly podcast exploring cultural and political issues.以及每週探討文化和政治問題的播客 The Culture War。His programs feature in-depth conversations on topics such as free speech, censorship, identity politics, and societal change,他的節目就言論自由、審查制度、身份政治和社會變革等話題進行深入對話，often engaging with a diverse range of guests.經常與各種各樣的嘉賓互動。He’s in Washington today because we are also hosting a local media row across the street in the Eisenhower building,他今天在華盛頓，因爲我們也在街對面的艾森豪威爾大廈舉辦地方媒體活動，which is a testament to our commitment to bringing new voices into the White House to cover the President and this administration.這證明了我們致力於將新聲音引入白宮來報道總統和本屆政府。So Tim, why don’t you kick us off today?那麼，蒂姆，你今天來開個頭怎麼樣？Yes, many of these organizations that are represented in this room have marched in lockstep on false narratives是的，這個房間裏代表的許多組織都在虛假敘事上步調一致，such as the Very Fine People hoax, the Covington smear, and now what’s being called the Maryland Man hoax,例如“非常好的人”騙局、科溫頓誹謗案，以及現在被稱爲“馬里蘭男子”騙局的事件，where an MS-13 gang member adjudicated by two different judges, I believe, is just simply being referred to as a Maryland man over and over again.據我所知，一名經兩名不同法官裁定的MS-13幫派成員，卻被一再地簡稱爲馬里蘭男子。Now in an effort from the White House to expand access to new companies, you’ve created this new media seat,現在，白宮爲了擴大新公司的參與機會，設立了這個新媒體席位，so I’m wondering if you can comment on the fact that following this expansion, numerous outlets have disparaged the companies that you’ve had sit here as well as the reporters.所以我想知道，您能否評論一下，在這次擴展之後，許多媒體機構貶低了曾坐在這裏的公司及其記者這一事實。I’m wondering if you can comment on the unprofessional behavior as well as elaborate on whether there are any plans to expand access to new companies.我想知道您能否評論這種不專業的行爲，並詳細說明是否有任何計劃來擴大新公司的參與機會。Sure, well we certainly welcome diverse viewpoints in this room, which is one of the reasons we have you in here,當然，我們當然歡迎這個房間裏的不同觀點，這也是我們邀請你來的原因之一，and there are many new faces in this room in comparison to the previous administrations.與前幾屆政府相比，這個房間裏有很多新面孔。We want to welcome all viewpoints into this room.我們希望歡迎所有觀點進入這個房間。We welcome unbiased journalists who really care about the truth and the facts and the accuracy,我們歡迎那些真正關心真相、事實和準確性的、不偏不倚的記者，and you rightfully pointed out the Maryland man story,你正確地指出了“馬里蘭男子”的故事，which, when the Atlantic published it, I addressed from this podium on the very first day, saying, “This is wrong.”當《大西洋月刊》發表它時，我第一天就在這個講臺上指出，“這是錯誤的。”The press in this room has this story wrong,這個房間裏的媒體搞錯了這個故事，and we have seen more and more evidence come to light that we have had all along.我們已經看到越來越多我們一直掌握的證據浮出水面。We were always right, the president was always on the right side of this issue, to deport this illegal criminal from our community,我們一直是對的，總統在這個問題上一直站在正確的一邊，即把這個非法罪犯驅逐出我們的社區，and it is despicable to see the media continue to refer to this individual as someone who is just a peaceful man living his life in Maryland.看到媒體繼續將此人稱爲只是在馬里蘭過着平靜生活的人，這是卑鄙的。This was and always has been an illegal criminal, an MS-13 gang member, and a designated foreign terrorist,這個人過去是，而且一直是一個非法罪犯、一名MS-13幫派成員和一名指定的外國恐怖分子，and the administration maintains our position to deport these individuals from our community.本屆政府堅持將這些人驅逐出我們社區的立場。So thank you for being here, Tim. It’s great to see you. Thank you. Dasha, why don’t you kick us off?所以謝謝你來到這裏，蒂姆。很高興見到你。謝謝。達莎，你來開始吧？Thank you, Caroline. You’re welcome. I really appreciate it.謝謝你，卡羅琳。不客氣。我真的很感激。I have two questions, one on the Pentagon and another on the economy.我有兩個問題，一個關於五角大樓，另一個關於經濟。You said on Fox News that the entire Pentagon is working against Secretary Hegseth,你在福克斯新聞上說整個五角大樓都在反對赫格塞斯部長，but the people who were fired were Hegseth’s own guys, so how do you square that and what do you say to concerns that that’s bad management?但被解僱的人是赫格塞斯自己的人，那麼你如何解釋這一點？對於認爲這是管理不善的擔憂，你作何評論？They were Pentagon employees who leaked against their boss to news agencies in this room,他們是五角大樓的僱員，向這個房間裏的新聞機構泄露了對他們老闆不利的信息，and it’s been clear since day one from this administration that we are not going to tolerate individuals who leak to the mainstream media,本屆政府從第一天起就明確表示，我們不會容忍向主流媒體泄密的人，particularly when it comes to sensitive information,尤其是在涉及敏感信息的情況下，and the Secretary of Defense is doing a tremendous job, and he is bringing monumental change to the Pentagon,國防部長做得非常出色，他正在給五角大樓帶來巨大的變革，and there are a lot of people in this city who reject monumental change,這個城市裏有很多人拒絕巨大的變革，and I think, frankly, that’s why we’ve seen a smear campaign against the Secretary of Defense坦率地說，我認爲這就是爲什麼我們看到針對國防部長的抹黑運動，since the moment that President Trump announced his nomination before the United States Senate.自從特朗普總統在美國參議院宣佈他的提名那一刻起。Let me reiterate, the President stands strongly behind Secretary Hegseth讓我重申，總統堅定地支持赫格塞斯部長in the change that he is bringing to the Pentagon and the results that he’s achieved thus far speak for themselves.以及他爲五角大樓帶來的變革，他迄今取得的成果不言自明。Is there an FBI investigation into the leaks? The Secretary said that these people would be prosecuted, so is the FBI investigating?聯邦調查局是否對泄密事件展開了調查？部長說這些人將被起訴，那麼聯邦調查局正在調查嗎？You have to ask the FBI, you have to ask the Department of Justice on what they plan to do,你得去問聯邦調查局，你得去問司法部他們計劃怎麼做，but certainly we take leaks with the utmost seriousness across this administration.但可以肯定的是，本屆政府上下都極其嚴肅地對待泄密事件。You’ve seen people fired from the Department of Homeland Security. The President has made it clear it’s an unacceptable behavior.你已經看到有人被國土安全部解僱了。總統已經明確表示這是不可接受的行爲。On the economy, Caroline, Peter Navarro said that it’s perfectly possible to do 90 deals in 90 days.關於經濟問題，卡羅琳，彼得·納瓦羅說在90天內達成90項交易是完全可能的。We haven’t seen one just yet. How soon might we see a deal,我們至今還沒有看到一項交易。我們可能多快看到一項交易，and what evidence can you share that progress is being made in these trade negotiations?你有什麼證據可以分享，表明這些貿易談判正在取得進展？Sure. Well, I spoke to our entire trade team this morning. There is a lot of progress being made.當然。嗯，我今天早上和我們整個貿易團隊談過了。進展很大。We now have 18 proposals on paper that have been brought to the trade team.我們現在有18份書面提案已經提交給貿易團隊。Again, these are proposals on paper that countries have proposed to the Trump administration and to our government.再次強調，這些是各國向特朗普政府和我國政府提出的書面提案。You have Secretary Besant, Secretary Lutnick, Ambassador Greer, NEC Director Hassett, and Peter Navarro, the entire trade team,你有貝桑特部長、盧特尼克部長、格里爾大使、國家經濟委員會主任哈塞特和彼得·納瓦羅，整個貿易團隊，meeting with 34 countries this week alone.僅本週就會見了34個國家。We are moving at Trump speed to ensure these deals are made on behalf of the American worker and the American people.我們正以特朗普速度前進，以確保代表美國工人和美國人民達成這些協議。And just yesterday, it seemed to get a little bit lost in the news, and I think it’s a disservice to the American public that it did.就在昨天，這件事似乎在新聞中有點被忽略了，我認爲這對美國公衆是不公平的。The Vice President announced terms of reference for a trade deal with India. That is a big deal.副總統宣佈了與印度達成貿易協議的職權範圍。這是一件大事。We know when we look at the numbers, the monetary trade barriers and the non-monetary trade barriers from India,我們知道，當我們查看數據時，印度的貨幣貿易壁壘和非貨幣貿易壁壘，they have been ripping off the United States and American workers for a very long time.長期以來一直在敲詐美國和美國工人。So the fact that the Vice President with Prime Minister Modi on that trip in India announced these terms of reference,因此，副總統在那次印度之行中與莫迪總理一起宣佈了這些職權範圍，which is essentially a framework to move the ball forward to sign a good trade deal between our two nations,這實質上是推動我們兩國簽署良好貿易協議的框架，is great progress and it speaks to the work ethic and the real labor that’s being put into this effort by the President’s trade team.是巨大的進步，也體現了總統貿易團隊在此項工作中付出的職業道德和辛勤勞動。Sure. Go ahead.當然。請講。Do the proposals that you talk about, is that enough to extend the pauses on these reciprocal tariffs,你談到的那些提案，是否足以延長對這些互惠關稅的暫停，or does the President need to see, you know, these deals inked and signed to offer any sort of additional extension beyond the 90 days?或者總統是否需要看到這些協議正式簽署才能提供超過90天的任何額外延期？Well, look, ask me in July when the deadline hits. I know I’ll be answering those questions from all of you in this room.嗯，這樣吧，等到七月份截止日期到了再問我。我知道我會回答這個房間裏你們所有人的這些問題。There’s a lot of time left, and the President’s trade team is working again at Trump speed, as quickly as they can, to ensure that these deals can be made.還有很多時間，總統的貿易團隊再次以特朗普速度工作，盡其所能，確保這些協議能夠達成。Are any of those conversations yet with China happening?這些對話中有沒有與中國進行的？I actually do have something to share on that.關於這個我確實有信息可以分享。I asked the President about this before coming out here, and he wanted me to share with all of you我出來之前問過總統這個問題，他想讓我告訴大家，that we’re doing very well with respect to a potential trade deal with China.我們在與中國達成潛在貿易協議方面進展順利。As I mentioned, 18 proposals have now been received, and more than 100 countries around the world want to make a deal with the United States of America,正如我提到的，現已收到18份提案，全世界有100多個國家希望與美利堅合衆國達成協議，and the President and the administration are setting the stage for a deal with China.總統和本屆政府正在爲與中國達成協議奠定基礎。So we feel everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen, and the ball is moving in the right direction. Sure.所以我們覺得所有相關方都希望看到貿易協議達成，並且事情正朝着正確的方向發展。當然。Setting the stage for a deal with China, what does that mean? Has the President spoken directly with Xi?爲與中國達成協議奠定基礎，這是什麼意思？總統是否直接與習近平通話了？I don’t have anything to read out on a direct talk between the President and President Xi, but we will continue to keep you updated.關於總統與習主席之間的直接通話，我沒有任何信息可以公佈，但我們會繼續向你們提供最新情況。And Secretary Besant reportedly today told investors that this trade standoff with China that he expects will be de-escalating soon,據報道，貝桑特部長今天告訴投資者，他預計與中國的貿易僵局將很快緩和，because as he described it, reportedly the situation is unsustainable.因爲據他所說，據報道，目前的局勢是不可持續的。Is the President considering taking steps to de-escalate the situation?總統是否正在考慮採取措施緩和局勢？Again, I just read you words directly from the President of the United States. Those were moments ago. That’s where his head is at right now. Sure.再說一遍，我剛剛讀給你的是美國總統的原話。那是剛纔說的。這就是他現在的想法。當然。Caroline, I have two questions, one on immigration and one on China. First on immigration.卡羅琳，我有兩個問題，一個關於移民，一個關於中國。首先是移民問題。Roughly, how many illegal immigrants and aliens do we have in our country, and how many does the administration plan on deporting?粗略地說，我們國家有多少非法移民和外國人？政府計劃驅逐多少人？Sure. Well, you’d have to ask the Department of Homeland Security for a specific number,當然。嗯，具體的數字你得問國土安全部，but we suspect it’s definitely in the millions, perhaps upwards of 20 million people但我們懷疑肯定有數百萬，可能高達2000萬人，that were allowed into the country illegally by the previous administration.是前任政府允許非法進入這個國家的。And the President and his team are focused on deporting as many as we possibly can, and they are moving as quickly as possible.總統和他的團隊正集中精力盡可能多地驅逐出境，並且他們正在儘快行動。The President’s team has made it clear we need more funding from Congress to do more.總統的團隊已經明確表示我們需要國會提供更多資金來做更多工作。We need more ICE agents out on the ground doing this very important work.我們需要更多的ICE探員在實地執行這項非常重要的工作。And we also need rogue district court judges to stop acting as judicial activists我們還需要流氓地方法院法官停止扮演司法活動家的角色，trying to block the administration from deporting illegal criminals from our nation’s interior.試圖阻止政府從我們國家內部驅逐非法罪犯。The American public elected the President to do this, and he’s following through with that promise.美國公衆選舉總統來做這件事，他正在履行這一承諾。We have over a quarter million Chinese nationals in our country right now on student visas.我們國家現在有超過25萬持有學生簽證的中國公民。Does the administration believe there’s any national security concern政府是否認爲這超過25萬在我們國家的中國公民when it comes to those over a quarter million Chinese nationals in our country?會帶來任何國家安全方面的擔憂？Well, as you know, when it comes to foreign visas, the Secretary of State has the right to revoke visas嗯，如你所知，在外國簽證方面，國務卿有權撤銷of those who we feel are acting in an adversarial way to our foreign policy interests here in the United States.那些我們認爲其行爲對我們在美國的國家利益構成敵對的人的簽證。He has that authority according to the Immigration and Nationality Act.根據《移民和國籍法》，他擁有這項權力。So I would defer you to the State Department for any individual case.所以我建議你就任何個案去諮詢國務院。But they are looking at individuals who are given the privilege of being on a visa in our country.但他們正在審查那些獲得特權持有我國簽證的個人。And if they are acting, again, adversarially to our foreign policy interests, their visa can be revoked, and they should be aware of that.如果他們的行爲，再次強調，對我們的外交政策利益具有敵意，他們的簽證可能會被吊銷，他們應該意識到這一點。Sure. Go ahead. Yes, I’m calling on you. Thank you, Caroline.當然。請講。是的，我叫你了。謝謝你，卡羅琳。Over the last few weeks, several countries have warned their citizens about travel to the U.S.過去幾周，一些國家警告其公民謹慎前往美國旅行。and the Department of Commerce’s own stats show that from a lot of countries the number of visitors is falling.商務部自己的統計數據也顯示，來自許多國家的訪客數量正在下降。Is there any message for people that might be reconsidering business or tourism travel to the U.S.?對於那些可能重新考慮來美國進行商務或旅遊旅行的人，有什麼信息要傳達嗎？Where did you see that report? It, it’s just coming from the Department of Commerce.你在哪裏看到那份報告的？它，它就是來自商務部。Said what? It’s hard to hear you. Sorry. That visitors from a lot of countries have fallen in the last three months.說什麼？聽不太清。抱歉。是說過去三個月來自很多國家的訪客數量下降了。I’d have to look at that report to comment on the merits of it.我得看看那份報告才能評論其內容。I think most people around the world recognize the United States of America is a great place to do business. It’s a beautiful place to visit.我認爲世界上大多數人都認識到美利堅合衆國是做生意的好地方。也是旅遊的好去處。And they should certainly come here because it’s a much safer country than it was four years ago under the previous president. Libby, good to see you.他們當然應該來這裏，因爲現在的美國比四年前前任總統時期安全多了。利比，很高興見到你。Caroline, a question about this upcoming announcement from HHS to ban food dyes.卡羅琳，一個關於衛生與公衆服務部（HHS）即將宣佈禁止食用色素的問題。During the first week of the administration, the FDA announced that it’s pulling its plan to ban menthol cigarettes.在本屆政府第一週，食品藥品監督管理局（FDA）宣佈撤銷其禁止薄荷醇香菸的計劃。So two questions for you. How do you square a ban on menthol cigarettes being pulled and then announcing this ban on food dyes?所以問你兩個問題。你怎麼解釋撤銷薄荷醇香菸禁令，然後又宣佈這項食用色素禁令？And then how does the President feel about this upcoming ban that RFK is going to announce?然後總統對小羅伯特·肯尼迪（RFK）即將宣佈的這項禁令感覺如何？Sure. Well, look, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the President nominated him because he trusts him to make this country healthy again.當然。嗯，你看，衛生與公衆服務部部長，總統提名他，是因爲信任他能讓這個國家再次健康起來。It’s not just a slogan. It really is a movement that has broken ground across the country.這不僅僅是一個口號。這確實是一場在全國範圍內取得突破的運動。There are millions of people who believe in RFK Jr., Secretary Kennedy, and what he’s doing.有數百萬人民相信小羅伯特·肯尼迪，肯尼迪部長，以及他正在做的事情。I don’t want to get ahead of HHS with this historic announcement later and the details of it.我不想在HHS稍後發佈這個歷史性公告及其細節之前搶先發言。But obviously the Secretary feels that he has reason and evidence to announce the ban on artificial dyes later,但顯然，部長認爲他有理由和證據在稍後宣佈禁止人工色素，and I’ll let him speak to that this afternoon. Phil.我會讓他在今天下午對此發言。菲爾。The President started the process of reclassifying more than 50,000 federal employees as Schedule F.總統啓動了將超過5萬名聯邦僱員重新歸類爲F類的程序。We’ve already seen this process move through a number of government agencies.我們已經看到這個程序在多個政府機構中推進。I’m curious, should we expect mass firings or is this a case-by-case approach, a scalpel or a sledgehammer?我很好奇，我們應該預期大規模解僱嗎？還是這是一個逐案處理的方法，是手術刀還是大錘？Well, look, as you saw on Friday, the President put out a statement about it.嗯，你看，正如你週五看到的，總統就此發表了一份聲明。The Office of Personnel Management reclassified workers. They’re now called Schedule Policy&#x2F;Career.人事管理辦公室對工作人員進行了重新分類。他們現在被稱爲政策&#x2F;職業類（Schedule Policy&#x2F;Career）。And all the President is trying to do is ensure that federal workers are being held accountable for corrupt behavior.總統所做的一切是爲了確保聯邦工作人員對其腐敗行爲負責。If they are engaging in corruption as a government worker, they should no longer have their job. I think that’s pretty common sense.如果他們作爲政府工作人員從事腐敗活動，他們就不應該再擁有這份工作。我認爲這是很基本的常識。He also believes that bureaucrats should be acting in accordance with the will of the American public,他還認爲，官僚們應該按照美國公衆的意願行事，who duly elected this President, not just this President, but all future Presidents.是美國公衆正式選舉了這位總統，不僅僅是這位總統，也包括所有未來的總統。If you work for the government, you should be adhering to the will of the American public and advancing the administration’s goals and interests.如果你爲政府工作，你應該遵守美國公衆的意願，並推進政府的目標和利益。And if you are not doing that, then you should go find another job whose interests you align with.如果你沒有這樣做，那麼你應該去找另一份符合你利益的工作。So as for specific firings, I would defer you to the specific agencies.因此，關於具體的解僱情況，我會建議你諮詢具體的機構。But the President, in this move by the Office of Personnel Management, it will make it easier to get rid of rogue bureaucrats who are engaging in corruption.但是，總統通過人事管理辦公室的這一舉措，將更容易清除那些從事腐敗活動的流氓官僚。And then another quick question about Google. Real quick.然後還有一個關於谷歌的快速問題。很快。A federal court ruled last Thursday that Google’s dominance of online advertising and tech markets violated U.S. antitrust laws.一家聯邦法院上週四裁定，谷歌在在線廣告和技術市場的主導地位違反了美國反壟斷法。I know the President has spoken to a number of folks in big tech, and Google’s CEO was even at his inauguration.我知道總統與科技巨頭的一些人士談過話，谷歌的CEO甚至出席了他的就職典禮。I’m curious, what is the President’s reaction to that court ruling?我很好奇，總統對那項法院裁決有何反應？I’ll have to ask him, and I’ll get back to you, Phil. You’re welcome. John.我得問問他，然後回覆你，菲爾。不客氣。約翰。Thanks a lot, Caroline. Some economic questions for you.非常感謝，卡羅琳。有幾個經濟問題問你。Kevin Hassett has been a key economic advisor to the President in both of his terms. In 2022, he said that the independence of the Fed is super important.凱文·哈塞特在總統兩屆任期內都是關鍵的經濟顧問。2022年，他說美聯儲的獨立性極其重要。That’s a direct quote. Is that something that the President subscribes to? Does he still believe in the independence of the Federal Reserve?這是原話。總統是否認同這一點？他是否仍然相信美聯儲的獨立性？Look, I think the President has made his position on the Fed and on Powell quite clear.聽着，我認爲總統在美聯儲和鮑威爾問題上的立場已經相當明確。The President believes that they have been making moves and taking action in the name of politics, rather than in the name of what’s right for the American economy.總統認爲，他們一直在以政治的名義而不是以對美國經濟有利的名義採取行動。The President has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.總統有權表達他對美聯儲的不滿，他有權說他認爲利率應該更低。He believes Americans should be able to borrow money cheaper than they currently are right now.他認爲美國人應該能夠以比現在更便宜的價格借到錢。And I also spoke to Kevin Hassett about the Fed as well, and he has called into question the Fed’s independence我也和凱文·哈塞特談過美聯儲的問題，他質疑了美聯儲的獨立性，and whether they are actually doing things, again, in the best interest of the economy, or are they doing it for partisan reasons?以及他們是否真的是再次爲了經濟的最佳利益行事，還是出於黨派原因？The President wants to see interest rates lower. He has made that quite clear.總統希望看到利率降低。他已經說得很清楚了。We’ve also seen the dollar at multi-year lows versus the euro and other currencies around the world.我們也看到美元兌歐元和世界其他貨幣處於多年低點。Is it the administration’s policy for a strong dollar? How does it view the dollar versus other currencies around the world?政府的政策是支持強勢美元嗎？它如何看待美元相對於世界其他貨幣的地位？The President wants to see the dollar remain as the world’s reserve currency for our long-term fiscal stability and our economic growth. He’s been quite clear about that.總統希望看到美元爲了我們長期的財政穩定和經濟增長而繼續保持世界儲備貨幣的地位。他對此一直很明確。Sure. And then to the woman behind you, who I haven’t seen before, welcome. Go ahead, Mary.當然。然後請你後面的那位女士提問，我以前沒見過你，歡迎。請講，瑪麗。Earth Day and then the Supreme Court, if that’s okay. That’s right. It’s Earth Day. Yes. Happy Earth Day, everyone.地球日，然後是最高法院，如果可以的話。是的。今天是地球日。是的。大家地球日快樂。I saw the President truthing about the garbage pileup from China and the Pacific,我看到總統在Truth Social上發帖談論來自中國和太平洋的垃圾堆積問題，and then I believe Lee Zeldin is headed to San Diego to investigate the pile of sewage from Mexico.然後我相信李·澤爾丁正前往聖地亞哥調查來自墨西哥的污水堆積問題。Can you speak to what the White House has planned for Earth Day and anything in that arena?你能談談白宮爲地球日計劃了什麼以及在該領域有什麼安排嗎？Sure. I do have points from the EPA. Administrator Zeldin is doing a fantastic job,當然。我確實有環保局（EPA）提供的信息。澤爾丁局長工作做得非常出色，and they are always sharing their accomplishments with the White House, which we very much appreciate.他們總是與白宮分享他們的成就，對此我們非常感激。He will be traveling, I believe he’s in California today, for the sewage situation. Here you go.他將出行，我相信他今天在加利福尼亞，處理污水問題。給你信息。Administrator Zeldin met with his Mexican counterpart to discuss steps Mexico needs to take to ensure the water entering the United States is clean and safe,澤爾丁局長會見了他的墨西哥同行，討論墨西哥需要採取哪些步驟來確保進入美國的水是乾淨和安全的，and he’s holding a press conference in San Diego today with elected officials and local stakeholders on the Tijuana River sewage crisis.他今天正在聖地亞哥與當選官員和當地利益相關者就蒂華納河污水危機舉行新聞發佈會。I would also add from the President himself, he has always maintained he wants America to have the cleanest air and the cleanest water,我還要補充一點來自總統本人的信息，他一直堅持希望美國擁有最清潔的空氣和最清潔的水，and we want to do what’s right for our environment and for our Earth,我們希望爲我們的環境和地球做正確的事情，and a lot of that is making sure that we have clean and sustainable energy,其中很大一部分是確保我們擁有清潔和可持續的能源，and we know that we produce natural gas cleaner and more efficiently than any country in this world, and the President wants to see that continue.我們知道我們生產天然氣比世界上任何國家都更清潔、更高效，總統希望這種情況繼續下去。Thank you. And then on the Supreme Court, I know the Court is hearing a case dealing with parents謝謝。然後關於最高法院，我知道法院正在審理一個涉及家長的案件，who don’t want their kids having to read gender ideology books in schools.這些家長不希望他們的孩子在學校裏必須閱讀涉及性別意識形態的書籍。Can you comment on that case and what the Trump administration hopes to see come from that? Sure.你能評論一下這個案件以及特朗普政府希望從中看到什麼結果嗎？當然。We hope the Supreme Court will do the right thing, and the President has been very clear.我們希望最高法院會做正確的事情，總統已經非常明確。He stands on the side of parental rights, and he believes strongly that parents should have a greater say in their children’s education他站在家長權利一邊，他堅信家長應該在子女的教育中有更大的發言權，and the content, if you will, that children are being exposed to in our public school system.以及孩子們在我們公立學校系統中接觸到的內容（如果你願意這麼說的話）。Sure. Go ahead. Hi. I’m Carolina Lumetta with World News Group.當然。請講。你好。我是世界新聞集團的卡羅萊娜·盧梅塔。The administration ended some temporary protections for Afghans, including several hundred Christians who have been punished by the Taliban.政府終止了對阿富汗人的一些臨時保護措施，其中包括數百名受到塔利班懲罰的基督徒。Is the President considering any exceptions for Afghans who could face death or torture if they return to their home country?總統是否正在考慮爲那些返回祖國可能面臨死亡或酷刑的阿富汗人提供任何例外？So let’s just be clear about one thing. We didn’t end that proactively. It expired,那麼，我們先明確一點。我們並非主動結束該計劃。它到期了，and it’s because the previous administration illegally paroled hundreds of thousands of people into the country這是因爲前任政府非法地將數十萬人假釋進入這個國家，and then gave them temporary protective status, which again is a temporary status. It’s not a permanent status in this country.然後給予他們臨時保護身份，這再次強調，是一個臨時身份。這不是在這個國家的永久身份。And if there are individuals here who came in through the Biden administration who want to claim asylum, there is a legal process to do that.如果這裏有通過拜登政府進來並想申請庇護的人，有合法的程序可以做到這一點。Those cases will be adjudicated by a judge on a case-by-case basis.這些案件將由法官逐案裁決。We have a legal immigration process in this country for a reason, and all this administration is trying to do is effectuate that. Reagan.我們國家設立合法的移民程序是有原因的，本屆政府所做的就是執行它。里根。Thank you, Caroline. I have two questions for you on immigration.謝謝你，卡羅琳。我有兩個關於移民的問題問你。March deportation numbers were down slightly from the same time period last year.三月份的驅逐出境人數與去年同期相比略有下降。SCOTUS recently ordered a pause on deporting Chaldean Iraqi members with the Alien Enemies Act.最高法院（SCOTUS）最近下令暫停使用《外僑敵人法》驅逐迦勒底伊拉克成員。I’m curious what other tools the administration is looking at to boost those deportation numbers. Sure.我很好奇政府正在考慮使用哪些其他工具來提高驅逐人數。當然。Well, we are obviously complying with the court’s order. However, it was a temporary pause.嗯，我們顯然在遵守法院的命令。然而，那只是一個暫時的暫停。The Supreme Court basically said sit tight and they will follow up with an order,最高法院基本上是說原地待命，他們會隨後發佈命令，and we’re confident that the Supreme Court will rule on the side of law我們相信最高法院將依法裁決，and recognize the President absolutely has the executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our nation’s interior under the Alien Enemies Act.並承認總統絕對擁有根據《外僑敵人法》從我們國家內部驅逐外國恐怖分子的行政權力。We feel very strongly about that, and we’re confident the courts will side with the President and his executive authority.我們對此感覺非常強烈，並且相信法院會支持總統及其行政權力。As for deportations, we continue to deport illegal criminals under Title 8,至於驅逐出境，我們繼續根據《美國法典》第8條驅逐非法罪犯，which is an immigration authority given to our Border Patrol agents and the Department of Homeland Security to deport illegal criminals from this country,這是賦予我們邊境巡邏人員和國土安全部從這個國家驅逐非法罪犯的移民權力，and the administration continues to do that at record speed as quickly as they can with the resources that they have.本屆政府繼續以創紀錄的速度，利用現有資源儘快地這樣做。The DOJ recently dropped charges against the MS-13 leader in Woodbridge, Virginia with the idea that this will expedite the deportation process.司法部（DOJ）最近撤銷了對弗吉尼亞州伍德布里奇一名MS-13頭目的指控，意在加快驅逐程序。Does the administration plan to drop charges against other criminal illegals to speed along the deportation process?政府是否計劃撤銷對其他犯罪非法移民的指控以加快驅逐進程？You’d have to ask the Department of Justice. Obviously, that’s within their purview and I can’t speak for them.你得去問司法部。顯然，這在他們的職權範圍內，我不能替他們發言。However, it is our goal to deport as many illegal criminals and aliens from our country as we possibly can as quickly as we can. Jackie.然而，我們的目標是儘可能快地、儘可能多地將非法罪犯和外國人驅逐出我們的國家。傑基。Thank you, Caroline. We’ve heard so much about this Saudi trip planning and the President’s mentioned it himself before,謝謝你，卡羅琳。我們聽到了很多關於這次沙特之行計劃的消息，總統本人之前也提到過，but I don’t think we’ve ever heard on the record what he hopes to achieve in Saudi Arabia and what the purpose of the trip is. Sure.但我認爲我們從未公開聽說過他希望在沙特阿拉伯實現什麼目標以及這次訪問的目的是什麼。當然。Well, the President looks forward to this. It was supposed to be his first foreign visit,嗯，總統對此很期待。這本應是他的首次外訪，but of course now he is going to Rome this weekend to honor the Pope and attend the funeral.但當然，他現在本週末要去羅馬向教皇致敬並參加葬禮。The President looks to strengthen the ties between the United States and these countries that he will be visiting.總統希望加強美國與他將要訪問的這些國家之間的聯繫。He’ll be having many bilateral meetings and talks, and we look forward to the trip and hope to see many of you there.他將舉行許多雙邊會談和討論，我們期待這次訪問，並希望在那裏見到你們中的許多人。And the meetings in London this week, do they have any nexus with the plans in Saudi Arabia?本週在倫敦的會議是否與沙特阿拉伯的計劃有任何聯繫？I can’t speak to that. However, I do have an update on meetings when it comes to the Russia-Ukraine war.我不能對此發表評論。然而，關於俄烏戰爭的會議，我確實有最新消息。I was just in the Oval Office with the President and Steve Witkoff, and they wanted everybody to know that the negotiations continue.我剛纔在橢圓形辦公室和總統以及史蒂夫·威特科夫在一起，他們希望大家知道談判仍在繼續。We feel, again, we’re hopefully moving in the right direction,我們再次感到，我們有希望朝着正確的方向前進，and the Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will be heading to Russia again later this week to continue talks with Vladimir Putin.特使史蒂夫·威特科夫將於本週晚些時候再次前往俄羅斯，繼續與弗拉基米爾·普京會談。Is that why Rubio is not heading to London? Is he accompanying Witkoff to Moscow?這就是盧比奧不去倫敦的原因嗎？他是否陪同威特科夫去莫斯科？I can’t speak for the Secretary of State’s travel schedule. I’d defer you to the Department of State.我無法評論國務卿的旅行日程。我建議你諮詢國務院。And more broadly, just about the peace agreement, the talks that are ongoing, Secretary Rubio had said更廣泛地說，關於和平協議，正在進行的談判，盧比奧部長曾說過，that if things don’t go the right way, that the U.S. might need to take a step back.如果事情進展不順利，美國可能需要退後一步。What does stepping back look like? Does that mean a step back from brokering peace,退後一步是什麼樣子？是指退出斡旋和平嗎？or would that imply a broader withdrawal from U.S. support for Ukraine?還是意味着更廣泛地撤回美國對烏克蘭的支持？Look, I think it would be unwise for me to broadcast that from this podium.聽着，我認爲從這個講臺上公佈這一點是不明智的。Ultimately, that’s a decision for the President to make, but he’s made it very clear he wants to see peace,最終，這是總統要做的決定，但他已經非常明確地表示他希望看到和平，he wants to see this war end, and he wants to stop the killing on both sides of this war.他希望這場戰爭結束，他希望停止戰爭雙方的殺戮。And he’s been very clear about that for quite some time, and he has grown frustrated with both sides of this war, and he’s made that well known. Caroline. Thank you.他對此已經明確表示了相當長一段時間，他對戰爭雙方都感到越來越沮喪，並且他已廣爲人知這一點。卡羅琳。謝謝。Last week, the President talked about non-profit groups, specifically taking on CREW,上週，總統談到了非營利組織，特別是針對CREW（華盛頓責任與道德公民組織），and he hinted that there could be further actions taken against non-profits.他暗示可能會對非營利組織採取進一步行動。Does the White House have any plans for any sort of actions against NGOs, non-profits, or other similar groups?白宮是否有任何針對非政府組織（NGOs）、非營利組織或其他類似團體的行動計劃？Is any of that coming up? Is that being worked on at this time?這些計劃即將出臺嗎？目前正在進行中嗎？I’ll have to check in with our policy team and get back to you. Sure.我得和我們的政策團隊覈實一下再回復你。當然。Thank you, Caroline. Travis Gilmore with the Epoch Times.謝謝你，卡羅琳。《大紀元時報》的特拉維斯·吉爾摩。Are some colleges using taxpayer funds to further political agendas, and what is the administration’s response to Harvard’s lawsuit? Sure.是否有部分大學利用納稅人資金推進政治議程？政府對哈佛大學的訴訟有何迴應？當然。Well, the President has made it quite clear that it’s Harvard who has put themselves in the position to lose their own funding by not obeying federal law,嗯，總統已經非常明確地表示，是哈佛大學自己不遵守聯邦法律，才使自己處於失去資金的境地，and we expect all colleges and universities who are receiving taxpayer funds to abide by federal law.我們期望所有接受納稅人資金的高校都遵守聯邦法律。It’s quite simple, and the President made it clear he’s not going to tolerate violations of federal law.這很簡單，總統明確表示他不會容忍違反聯邦法律的行爲。He’s not going to tolerate illegal harassment and violence towards Jewish American students or students of any faith on our campuses across the country.他不會容忍在我們全國各地的校園裏針對猶太裔美國學生或任何信仰的學生的非法騷擾和暴力。And so we will be responding to the lawsuit in court, and again, it’s quite simple. If you want federal dollars, obey federal law.因此我們將在法庭上回應這起訴訟，再說一遍，這很簡單。如果你想要聯邦資金，就遵守聯邦法律。And just to quickly follow up on China, any response to reports that China is targeting U.S. trade allies快速跟進一下中國問題，對於有報道稱中國正在針對支持美國議程的美國貿易盟友with potential retaliatory measures for supporting U.S. agendas?採取潛在報復措施，有何迴應？I think the numbers and the sheer number of countries that have reached out to the United States我認爲那些聯繫美國、聯繫本屆政府and reached out to this administration to cut good trade deals speak for themselves.以達成良好貿易協議的國家數量本身就說明了問題。The entire world knows that they need the United States of America, and they want to do business here.全世界都知道他們需要美利堅合衆國，他們想在這裏做生意。And so we’ll stay focused on cutting good trade deals on behalf of the American worker. Stephanie. Thank you, Caroline.因此，我們將繼續專注於代表美國工人達成良好的貿易協議。斯蒂芬妮。謝謝你，卡羅琳。Can you give us any additional details from the President’s call with Netanyahu today?你能提供更多關於總統今天與內塔尼亞胡通話的細節嗎？Oh, I did speak to the President about it. It was a good call.哦，我確實和總統談過這件事了。這是一次很好的通話。They spoke particularly about Iran and the negotiations that are underway with Iran and the United States.他們特別談到了伊朗以及正在進行的與伊朗和美國的談判。And the President has made it very clear repeatedly, but I’ll reiterate,總統已經反覆明確表示，但我還是要重申，there is no daylight between the United States of America and the state of Israel. He stands strongly behind our ally.美利堅合衆國和以色列國之間沒有任何分歧。他堅定地支持我們的盟友。He’s made it quite clear when it comes to Iran that we want to see a deal, and Iran has a choice to make.在伊朗問題上，他已經非常明確地表示我們希望達成協議，伊朗需要做出選擇。But the President has also made it very clear, and he reiterated that in his call with Prime Minister Netanyahu today但總統也已經非常明確，並且在今天與內塔尼亞胡總理的通話中重申了這一點，about the need for Iran to never obtain a nuclear weapon.即伊朗絕不能獲得核武器的必要性。I do have one more bit of news that I would like to share with all of you. Just give me one second to find it.我還有一條消息想和大家分享。請給我一秒鐘找一下。And it’s in regards to the terrorist attack that took place in India earlier today.這是關於今天早些時候在印度發生的恐怖襲擊事件。The President has been briefed by the National Security Advisor, and he’s being kept up to speed as more facts are learned.總統已聽取國家安全顧問的簡報，並且隨着更多事實的瞭解，他會持續跟進最新情況。What we know already is dozens were killed and even more were injured in a brutal terrorist attack in a popular tourist location in South Kashmir.我們已經知道的是，在南克什米爾一個熱門旅遊地點發生了一起殘酷的恐怖襲擊，造成數十人死亡，更多人受傷。President Trump will be speaking with Prime Minister Modi as soon as he possibly can to express his heartfelt condolences for those lost.特朗普總統將盡快與莫迪總理通話，對遇難者表示誠摯的哀悼。And our prayers are with those injured and our nation’s support for our ally India.我們的祈禱與傷者同在，我們國家支持我們的盟友印度。These types of horrific events by terrorists are why those of us who work for peace and stability in the world continue our mission.恐怖分子製造的這類可怕事件正是我們這些爲世界和平與穩定而努力的人繼續我們使命的原因。So we’ll give you a readout of that call later this afternoon. There’s a lot of work to be had.所以我們會在今天下午晚些時候向你們通報那次通話的內容。還有很多工作要做。You may hear from the President later this afternoon as well, and we’ll see you all later.今天下午晚些時候你們可能也會聽到總統的消息，我們稍後再見。 【核心词汇 - B1_C2】 單詞 音標 詞性 釋義 等級 次數 Atlantic &#x2F;ətˈlæntɪk&#x2F;

There you are, Usha.這是我第一次來到我妻子父母的出生地，她當然就在前排那裏。你在這兒呢，烏莎。She’s a bit of a celebrity, it turns out, in India, I think more so than her husband.事實證明，她在印度有點像個名人，我想比她丈夫更是如此。But I haven’t been here long, but already I’ve been fortunate enough to visit the Akshardham Temple,但我來這裏不久，就已經有幸參觀了阿克薩達姆神廟（Akshardham Temple），did I pronounce that right, honey? I did okay? All right.我發音對了嗎，親愛的？還行？好的。With my family this morning, as a matter of fact,事實上，今天早上我和我的家人一起去了，and last night Prime Minister Modi welcomed me, Usha, and our three small children at his beautiful home.昨晚莫迪總理在他美麗的家中歡迎了我、烏莎和我們的三個小孩。I’ve been amazed by the ancient beauty of the architecture of India, by the richness of India’s history and traditions,我驚歎於印度建築的古老之美，驚歎於印度歷史和傳統的豐富多彩，but also by India’s laser-like focus on the future.也驚歎於印度對未來如同激光般精準的關注。And those things, I think this appreciation for history and tradition我認爲，這些東西，這種對歷史和傳統的欣賞and this focus on the future is very much something that I think animates this country in 2025.以及對未來的關注，正是我認爲在2025年賦予這個國家活力的東西。Now, in other countries I’ve visited, it sometimes feels like there’s a flatness, a sameness, a desire to just be like everyone else in the world.現在，在我訪問過的其他國家，有時會感覺那裏有一種扁平化、一種同質化，一種只想和世界上其他人一樣的渴望。But it’s different here. There’s a vitality to India, a sense of infinite possibility,但這裏不同。印度充滿活力，有一種無限可能的感覺，of new homes to be built, new skylines to be raised, and lives to be enriched.有新的家園待建，新的天際線待升，新的生活待豐富。And there’s a pride in being Indian, a feeling of excitement about the days that lie ahead.這裏有一種作爲印度人的自豪感，一種對未來日子的興奮感。Now, it’s a striking contrast with too many in the West, where some in our leadership class seem stricken by self-doubt and even fear of the future.這與西方許多人形成了鮮明對比，我們的一些領導層似乎被自我懷疑甚至對未來的恐懼所困擾。To them, humanity is always one bad decision away from catastrophe.對他們來說，人類總是一個錯誤的決定就會導致災難。“The world will soon end,” they tell us, “because we’re burning too much fuel or making too many things or having too many children.”“世界很快就要終結了，”他們告訴我們，“因爲我們燃燒了太多燃料，製造了太多東西，或者生了太多孩子。”And so, rather than invest in the future, they too often retreat from it.因此，他們往往不是投資未來，而是從中退縮。Some of them pass laws that force their nations to use less power.他們中的一些人通過法律迫使自己的國家減少能源使用。They cancel nuclear and other energy generation facilities,他們取消核能和其他能源生產設施，even as their choices, the choices of these leaders, lead to more dependence on foreign adversaries.即使他們的選擇，這些領導人的選擇，導致了對外國對手的更大依賴。Meanwhile, their message to their friends, to countries like India, is to tell them that they are not allowed to grow.與此同時，他們給朋友，像印度這樣的國家的信息是，告訴他們不允許發展。Well, President Trump rejects these failed ideas. He wants America to grow. He wants India to grow.嗯，特朗普總統拒絕這些失敗的想法。他希望美國發展。他希望印度發展。And he wants to build the future with our partners all over the globe.他希望與我們全球的夥伴共同建設未來。And when I look at this audience, or when I visit this incredible country over these last couple of days,當我看着這裏的觀衆，或者當我在過去幾天訪問這個不可思議的國家時，I see a people that will not be held back.我看到一個不會被阻礙的人民。Now, the most profound responsibility, I believe, that all of us have is not to ourselves,現在，我相信，我們所有人肩負的最深遠的責任，不是對我們自己，but to the next generation, to make sure we leave them with a better society than the one that our parents and our grandparents gave us.而是對下一代，確保我們留給他們一個比我們父母和祖父母給予我們的更好的社會。And this is the world that America seeks to create with you.這就是美國尋求與你們共同創造的世界。We want to build a bright new world, one that’s constantly innovating, one that’s helping people to form families,我們想建設一個光明的、不斷創新的新世界，一個幫助人們組建家庭的世界，making it easier to build, invest and trade together in pursuit of common goals.一個讓共同建設、投資和貿易以追求共同目標變得更容易的世界。Now, I believe that our nations have much to offer one another.現在，我相信我們兩國可以互相提供很多東西。And that’s why we come to you as partners looking to strengthen our relationship.這就是爲什麼我們作爲夥伴來到你們這裏，尋求加強我們的關係。Now, we’re not here to preach that you do things any one particular way.現在，我們不是來這裏說教你們要以某種特定的方式做事。Too often in the past, Washington approached Prime Minister Modi with an attitude of preachiness, or even one of condescension.過去，華盛頓方面常常以說教甚至居高臨下的態度對待莫迪總理。Prior administrations saw India as a source of low-cost labor, on the one hand,過去的政府一方面將印度視爲廉價勞動力的來源，even as they criticized the Prime Minister’s government, arguably the most popular in the democratic world.另一方面卻批評總理的政府，而這可以說是民主世界中最受歡迎的政府。And as I told Prime Minister Modi last night, he’s got approval ratings that would make me jealous.正如我昨晚告訴莫迪總理的，他的支持率會讓我嫉妒。But it wasn’t just India. This attitude captured too much of our economic relationship with the rest of the world.但這不僅僅是針對印度。這種態度過多地體現在我們與世界其他地區的經濟關係中。So we shipped countless jobs overseas and with them our capacity to make things, from furniture, appliances and even weapons of war.所以我們將無數的工作崗位轉移到海外，隨之而去的是我們的製造能力，從傢俱、家電甚至到戰爭武器。We traded hard power for soft power, because with economic integration, we were told, would also come peace through sameness.我們用硬實力換取軟實力，因爲我們被告知，經濟一體化也會帶來同質化帶來的和平。Over time, we’d all assume the same sort of bland, secular, universal values.隨着時間的推移，我們都會接受那種平淡、世俗、普世的價值觀。No matter where you lived, the world was flat after all.畢竟，無論你住在哪裏，世界是平的。That was the thesis and that was what they told us.那就是他們的論點，那就是他們告訴我們的。And when that thesis proved false, or at least incomplete, leaders in the West took it upon themselves to flatten it by any means necessary.而當這個論點被證明是錯誤的，或者至少是不完整的，西方的領導人就自作主張，不擇手段地將其“壓平”。But many people across the world, and I think your country counts among them, they did not want to be flattened.但世界上的許多人，我想貴國也在此列，他們不想被“壓平”。Many were proud of where they came from, their way of life, the kind of jobs they worked and the kind of jobs their parents worked before them.許多人爲他們的出身、他們的生活方式、他們所從事的工作以及他們父母之前所從事的工作感到自豪。And that very much includes people in my own country, the United States of America.這也非常包括我自己國家的人民，美利堅合衆國的人民。Now some of you are aware of my own background. I actually didn’t plan to talk about my background at all until last night at dinner,現在有些人知道我的背景。其實我根本沒打算談我的背景，直到昨晚晚宴時，while my children mostly behaved, we gave them an A- for behavior with the Prime Minister.我的孩子們大體上表現不錯，我們給他們在總理面前的表現打了 A-。The Prime Minister said, “I have one request. I want you to talk a little bit about your background.” And so I wanted to do that.總理說：“我有一個請求。我希望你稍微談談你的背景。” 所以我想這麼做。For those of you who don’t know anything about me, I wanted to talk about it.對於那些對我一無所知的人，我想談談這個。I come from, and I’m biased, the greatest state in the Union, the state of Ohio,我來自，我帶有偏見地說，聯邦中最偉大的州，俄亥俄州，a long-time manufacturing powerhouse in the United States of America.一個在美國長期以來的製造業重鎮。My home specifically is a place called Middletown.我的家鄉具體來說是一個叫做米德爾敦的地方。Now it’s not a massive city by any means, it’s not Jaipur, but it’s a decent-sized town and a place where people make things,它絕不是一個大城市，不是齋浦爾，但它是一個規模適中的城鎮，一個人們製造東西的地方，which has been a point of pride in Middletown for generations.這在米德爾敦幾代人以來都是一個值得驕傲的地方。It’s filled with families like my own, some of whom called us hillbillies,那裏充滿了像我家一樣的家庭，其中一些人稱我們爲“鄉巴佬”（hillbillies），Americans who came down from the surrounding hills and mountains of West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky他們是從西弗吉尼亞、田納西和肯塔基周圍的山區下來的美國人，to cities like Middletown in pursuit of the manufacturing jobs that were creating widespread prosperity for families all across America.來到像米德爾敦這樣的城市，追求那些曾爲全美家庭創造廣泛繁榮的製造業工作。They came to Middletown in search of what we call back home the American dream.他們來到米德爾敦，尋找我們家鄉所謂的美國夢。In Middletown, my parents raised me. My grandparents raised me.在米德爾敦，我的父母撫養了我。我的祖父母撫養了我。They taught us to work hard, they taught me to study hard, and they taught me to love God and my country and always be good to your own.他們教導我們要努力工作，教導我要努力學習，教導我要熱愛上帝和我的國家，並始終善待自己人。My granddad, who I called Papaw growing up, he typified that.我的外祖父，我從小叫他 Papaw，他就是典型的代表。Late into life, he worked as a steelmaker at the local mill, and I know India has a lot of those.直到晚年，他都在當地的鋼廠當鍊鋼工人，我知道印度有很多這樣的鋼廠。Papaw’s job gave him a good wage, stable hours, and a generous pension.Papaw 的工作給了他不錯的工資、穩定的工時和豐厚的養老金。All that allowed him to support not just him and my grandmother, but his own daughter and grandkids with him.所有這些讓他不僅能養活他和我的外祖母，還能養活他自己的女兒和外孫們。Now, by the time I came around, money was awfully tight, but he worked hard to make a good living for all of us.現在，到我出生的時候，錢已經非常緊張了，但他努力工作，爲我們所有人創造了好的生活。Now, I know Papaw and Mamaw were grateful for the way of life their country made possible.現在，我知道 Papaw 和 Mamaw 感激他們的國家使這種生活方式成爲可能。Their generation bore witness to the formation of America’s great middle class.他們那一代人見證了美國偉大的中產階級的形成。And by creating an economy centered around production, around workers who build things,通過創建一個以生產爲中心、以建設者爲中心、and around the value of their labor, our nation’s leaders then transformed their country and made thousands of little Middletowns possible.以勞動價值爲中心的經濟，我們國家的領導人隨後改變了他們的國家，使得成千上萬個小小的米德爾敦成爲可能。The government supported its labor force. We created incentives for productive industries to take root政府支持其勞動力。我們創造激勵措施讓生產性行業紮根，and struck good deals with international partners to sell the goods made in the United States of America.並與國際夥伴達成良好協議，銷售在美國製造的商品。But as America settled in to world-historic prosperity it generated,但隨着美國沉浸在其產生的世界歷史性的繁榮中，our leaders began to take that very prosperity and what created it for granted.我們的領導人開始將這種繁榮及其根源視爲理所當然。They forgot the importance of building, of supporting productive industry,他們忘記了建設的重要性，忘記了支持生產性行業的重要性，of striking fair deals, and of supporting our workers and their families.忘記了達成公平交易以及支持我們的工人及其家庭的重要性。And as time went on, we saw the consequences. In my hometown, factories left, jobs evaporated,隨着時間的推移，我們看到了後果。在我的家鄉，工廠離開了，工作消失了，and America’s Middletowns ceased to be the lifeblood of our nation’s economy.美國的米德爾敦們不再是我們國家經濟的命脈。And the United States, as it became transformed, those very people, the working class, the background of the United States of America,隨着美國的轉型，正是那些人，工人階級，美國的中堅力量，were dismissed as backwards for holding on to the values their people had held dear for generations.因爲堅守他們人民世代珍視的價值觀而被斥爲落後。Now, Middletown’s story is my story, but it’s hardly unusual in the United States of America.現在，米德爾敦的故事就是我的故事，但在美利堅合衆國，這並非罕見。There are tens of millions of Americans who over the last 20 or so years have woken up to what’s happening in our nation.在過去大約20年裏，有數千萬美國人已經意識到我們國家正在發生什麼。But I believe they woke up well before it’s too late.但我相信他們在爲時已晚之前就已經醒悟。Now, like you, we want to appreciate our history, our culture, our religion.現在，像你們一樣，我們想要珍視我們的歷史、我們的文化、我們的宗教。We want to do commerce and strike good deals with our friends.我們想要與朋友進行商業往來並達成好的協議。We want to found our vision of the future upon the proud recognition of our heritage, rather than self-loathing and fear.我們希望將我們對未來的願景建立在對我們遺產的自豪認知之上，而不是自我厭惡和恐懼。I work for a president who has long understood all of this,我爲一位長期以來一直理解這一切的總統工作，whether through fighting those who seek to erase American history or in support of fair trade deals abroad.無論是通過與那些試圖抹殺美國曆史的人作鬥爭，還是支持國外的公平貿易協議。He has been consistent on these issues for decades.幾十年來，他在這些問題上一直保持一致。And as a result, under the Trump administration, America now has a government that has learned from the mistakes of the past.因此，在特朗普政府的領導下，美國現在有了一個吸取了過去錯誤的教訓的政府。It’s why President Trump cares so deeply about protecting the manufacturing economy that is the lifeblood of American prosperity這就是爲什麼特朗普總統如此深切地關心保護作爲美國繁榮命脈的製造業經濟，and making sure America’s workers have opportunities for good jobs.並確保美國工人有機會獲得好工作。As we saw earlier this month, he will go to extraordinary lengths to protect and expand those opportunities for all Americans.正如我們本月早些時候看到的，他將不遺餘力地保護和擴大所有美國人的這些機會。And so today I come here with a simple message. Our administration seeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and of shared national interests.因此，今天我帶着一個簡單的信息來到這裏。我們的政府尋求基於公平和共同國家利益的貿易伙伴。We want to build relationships with our foreign partners who respect their workers,我們希望與尊重本國工人的外國夥伴建立關係，who don’t suppress their wages to boost exports, but respect the value of their labor.他們不壓低工資以促進出口，而是尊重其勞動價值。We want partners that are committed to working with America to build things,我們希望合作伙伴致力於與美國一起建設，not just allowing themselves to become a conduit for transshipping others’ goods.而不僅僅是讓自己成爲轉運他人貨物的渠道。And finally, we want to partner with people and countries who recognize the historic nature of the moment we’re in,最後，我們希望與認識到我們所處時刻的歷史性的人民和國家合作，of the need to come together and build something truly new,認識到需要團結起來，建設真正新事物，a system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair.一個平衡、開放、穩定和公平的全球貿易體系。Now, I want to be clear. America’s partners need not look exactly like America, nor must our governments do everything exactly the same way.現在，我想明確一點。美國的夥伴不必看起來完全像美國，我們的政府也不必完全以相同的方式做所有事情。But we should have some common goals, and I believe here in India we do, in both economics and in national security.但我們應該有一些共同的目標，我相信在印度這裏我們做到了，無論是在經濟還是國家安全方面。And that’s why we’re so excited. That’s why I’m so excited to be here today.這就是爲什麼我們如此興奮。這就是爲什麼我今天如此興奮地來到這裏。In India, America has a friend, and we seek to strengthen the warm bonds our great nations already share.在美國，印度是一位朋友，我們尋求加強我們偉大國家之間已經存在的溫暖紐帶。Now, critics have attacked my president, President Trump, for starting a trade war in an effort to bring back the jobs of the past,現在，批評者攻擊我的總統，特朗普總統，說他發動貿易戰是爲了帶回過去的就業崗位，but nothing could be further from the truth.但這與事實相去甚遠。He seeks to rebalance global trade so that America, with friends like India, can build a future worth having for all of our people together.他尋求重新平衡全球貿易，以便美國能與像印度這樣的朋友一起，爲我們所有的人民共同建設一個值得擁有的未來。And when President Trump and Prime Minister Modi announced in February that our countries aim to more than double our bilateral trade當特朗普總統和莫迪總理在二月份宣佈，我們兩國旨在將雙邊貿易額增加一倍以上，to $500 billion by the end of the decade,在本十年末達到5000億美元時，I know that both of them meant it. And I’m encouraged by everything our nations are doing to get us there.我知道他們兩人都是認真的。我對我們兩國爲實現這一目標所做的一切感到鼓舞。As many of you are aware, both of our governments are hard at work on a trade agreement built on shared priorities, like creating new jobs,正如你們許多人所知，我們兩國政府都在努力制定一項基於共同優先事項的貿易協定，例如創造新的就業機會，building durable supply chains, and achieving prosperity for our workers.建立持久的供應鏈，以及爲我們的工人實現繁榮。In our meeting yesterday, Prime Minister Modi and I made very good progress on all of those points.在昨天的會晤中，莫迪總理和我在所有這些方面都取得了非常好的進展。And we are especially excited to formally announce that America and India have officially finalized the terms of reference for the trade negotiation.我們特別興奮地正式宣佈，美國和印度已正式敲定貿易談判的職權範圍。I think this is a vital step. I believe this is a vital step toward realizing President Trump’s and Prime Minister Modi’s vision我認爲這是至關重要的一步。我相信這是實現特朗普總統和莫迪總理願景的關鍵一步，because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations.因爲它爲我們兩國達成最終協議設定了路線圖。I believe there is much that America and India can accomplish together.我相信美國和印度可以共同完成很多事情。And on that note, I want to talk about a few areas of collaboration today, how India and the United States can work together.關於這一點，我今天想談談幾個合作領域，即印度和美國如何能夠合作。First, perhaps most importantly, to protect our nations.首先，也許是最重要的，保護我們的國家。Second, to build great things. And finally, to innovate the cutting-edge technologies both our countries will need in the years to come.其次，建設偉大的事物。最後，創新我們兩國在未來幾年都將需要的前沿技術。Now, on defense, our countries already enjoy a close relationship, one of the closest relationships in the world.現在，在國防方面，我們兩國已經享有密切的關係，是世界上最密切的關係之一。America does more military exercises with India than we do with any other nation on Earth.美國與印度進行的軍事演習比我們與地球上任何其他國家都多。The U.S.-India Compact that President Trump and Prime Minister Modi announced in February特朗普總統和莫迪總理在二月份宣佈的美印契約will lay the foundation for even closer collaboration between our countries.將爲我們兩國之間更緊密的合作奠定基礎。From javelins to striker combat vehicles,從標槍導彈到斯崔克戰車，our nations will co-produce many of the munitions and equipment that we’ll need to deter foreign aggressors,我們兩國將共同生產許多我們需要用來威懾外國侵略者的彈藥和裝備，not because we seek war, but because we seek peace and we believe the best path to peace is through mutual strength.不是因爲我們尋求戰爭，而是因爲我們尋求和平，我們相信通往和平的最佳途徑是通過共同的力量。And the launching the Joint Autonomous Systems Industry Alliance以及啓動聯合自主系統產業聯盟will enable America and India to develop the most state-of-the-art maritime systems needed for victory.將使美國和印度能夠開發取得勝利所需的最先進的海上系統。It’s fitting that India this year is hosting the Quad Leaders Summit this fall.印度今年秋天主辦四方領導人峯會是恰當的。Our interests in a free, open, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific are in full alignment.我們在自由、開放、和平與繁榮的印太地區的利益是完全一致的。Both of us know that the region must remain safe from any hostile powers that seek to dominate it.我們雙方都知道，該地區必須保持安全，免受任何尋求主宰該地區的敵對勢力的威脅。Growing relations between our countries over the last decade過去十年我們兩國之間不斷髮展的關係are part of what led America to designate India a major defense partner, the first of that class.是美國將印度指定爲主要國防夥伴的部分原因，這是該類別中的第一個。This designation means that India now shares with the UAE a defense and technology infrastructure這一指定意味着印度現在與阿聯酋共享國防和技術基礎設施，and partnership with the United States on par with America’s closest allies and friends.以及與美國建立的夥伴關係，其水平與美國最親密的盟友和朋友相當。But we actually feel that India has much more to gain from its continued defense partnership with the United States,但我們實際上認爲，印度可以從其與美國的持續防務夥伴關係中獲得更多收益，and let me sketch that out a little bit.讓我稍微勾勒一下。We, of course, want to collaborate more. We want to work together more.我們當然希望加強合作。我們希望更多地共同努力。And we want your nation to buy more of our military equipment, which, of course, we believe is the best in class.我們希望貴國購買更多我們的軍事裝備，當然，我們相信這是同類中最好的。American fifth-generation F-35s, for example,例如，美國的第五代F-35戰鬥機，would give the Indian Air Force the ability to defend your airspace and protect your people like never before.將賦予印度空軍前所未有的保衛領空和保護人民的能力。And I’ve met a lot of great people from the Indian Air Force just in the last couple of days.在過去的幾天裏，我遇到了很多來自印度空軍的優秀人才。India, like America, wants to build, and that will mean that we have to produce more energy.印度和美國一樣，想要建設，這意味着我們必須生產更多的能源。It’s more energy production and more energy consumption.這意味着更多的能源生產和更多的能源消耗。And it’s one of the many reasons why I think our nations have so much to gain by strengthening our energy ties.這也是我認爲我們兩國可以通過加強能源聯繫而獲益良多的衆多原因之一。As President Trump is fond of saying, America has once again begun to drill, baby, drill.正如特朗普總統喜歡說的，美國再次開始“鑽探吧，寶貝，鑽探吧”（drill, baby, drill）。And we think that will accrue to the benefit of Americans, but it will also benefit India as well.我們認爲這將使美國人受益，但同樣也會使印度受益。Past administrations in the United States of America,美國過去的政府，I think motivated by a fear of the future, have tied our hands and restricted American investments in oil and natural gas production.我認爲是出於對未來的恐懼，束縛了我們的手腳，限制了美國在石油和天然氣生產方面的投資。This administration recognizes that cheap, dependable energy is an essential part of making things本屆政府認識到，廉價、可靠的能源是製造業的重要組成部分，and is an essential part of economic independence for both of our nations.也是我們兩國經濟獨立的重要組成部分。Of course, America is blessed with vast natural resources and an unusual capacity to generate energy.當然，美國擁有豐富的自然資源和非凡的能源生產能力。So much that we want to be able to sell it to our friends like India.如此之多，以至於我們希望能夠將其出售給我們像印度這樣的朋友。We believe your nation will benefit from American energy exports and expanding those exports.我們相信貴國將從美國的能源出口和擴大這些出口中受益。You’ll be able to build more, make more, and grow more, but at much lower energy costs.你們將能夠建造更多、製造更多、發展更多，而且能源成本要低得多。We also want to help India explore its own considerable natural resources, including its offshore natural gas reserves and critical mineral supplies.我們也想幫助印度勘探其自身可觀的自然資源，包括其海上天然氣儲量和關鍵礦產供應。We have the capacity and we have the desire to help.我們有能力，也有意願提供幫助。Moreover, we think energy co-production will help beat unfair competitors in other foreign markets.此外，我們認爲能源聯合生產將有助於在其他國外市場擊敗不公平的競爭對手。But India, we believe, can go a long way to enhance energy ties between our nations.但是印度，我們相信，可以在加強我們兩國能源聯繫方面大有作爲。And one suggestion I’d have is maybe consider dropping some of the non-tariff barriers for American access to the Indian market.我有一個建議是，也許可以考慮取消一些針對美國進入印度市場的非關稅壁壘。Now, I’ve talked about this, of course, with Prime Minister Modi.當然，我已經和莫迪總理談過這件事了。And look, President Trump and I know that Prime Minister Modi is a tough negotiator.看，特朗普總統和我知道莫迪總理是一位強硬的談判者。He drives a hard bargain. It’s one of the reasons why we respect him.他很會討價還價。這也是我們尊重他的原因之一。And we don’t blame Prime Minister Modi for fighting for India’s industry.我們不責怪莫迪總理爲印度的工業而戰。But we do blame American leaders of the past for failing to do the same for our workers.但我們確實責怪過去的美國領導人未能爲我們的工人做同樣的事情。And we believe that we can fix that to the mutual benefit of both the United States and India.我們相信我們可以解決這個問題，使美國和印度互惠互利。Let me give an example.讓我舉個例子。American ethanol, we believe made from the finest corn in the world, can play a tremendous role in enhancing our partnership.美國的乙醇，我們相信是用世界上最好的玉米制成的，可以在加強我們的夥伴關係方面發揮巨大作用。And I know our farmers would be delighted to support India’s energy security ambitions.我知道我們的農民會很高興支持印度的能源安全雄心。We welcome the Modi government’s budget announcement to amend India’s civil nuclear liability laws,我們歡迎莫迪政府在預算中宣佈修改印度的民用核責任法，which currently prevent U.S. producers from exporting small modular reactors and building larger U.S.-designed reactors in India.該法律目前阻止美國生產商出口小型模塊化反應堆並在印度建造更大的美國設計的反應堆。There’s much that we can create, much that we can do together.我們可以共同創造很多，共同做很多事情。We believe that American energy can help realize India’s nuclear power production goals, and this is very important, as well as its AI ambitions.我們相信美國的能源可以幫助實現印度的核電生產目標，這一點非常重要，同時也能助其實現人工智能的雄心。Because as the United States knows well and I know that India knows well, there is no AI future without energy security and energy dominance.因爲正如美國深知，我也知道印度深知，沒有能源安全和能源主導地位，就沒有人工智能的未來。And that brings me to my final point of collaboration.這就引出了我關於合作的最後一點。I believe that the technological collaboration between our countries is going to extend well beyond defense and energy.我相信我們兩國之間的技術合作將遠遠超出國防和能源領域。The U.S.-India Trust Initiative that President Trump and Prime Minister Modi have launched will be a cornerstone of the partnership in the future.特朗普總統和莫迪總理啓動的美印信任倡議將成爲未來夥伴關係的基石。It will build on billions of dollars of planned investments that American companies have already announced across India.它將建立在美國公司已宣佈在印度各地進行的數十億美元計劃投資的基礎上。In the years to come, we’re going to see data centers, pharmaceuticals, undersea cables在未來的歲月裏，我們將看到數據中心、藥品、海底電纜and countless other critical goods being developed and being built because of the American and Indian economic partnership.以及無數其他關鍵商品因爲美印經濟夥伴關係而被開發和建造。And I’ll say it again, I think that our nations have so much to gain by investing in one another,我再說一遍，我認爲我們兩國通過相互投資可以獲益良多，America investing in India and, of course, India investing in the United States of America.美國投資印度，當然，還有印度投資美利堅合衆國。And I know that Americans, our people, are excited about that prospect and that President Trump and I are looking forward to stronger ties.我知道美國人，我們的人民，對這個前景感到興奮，特朗普總統和我期待着更緊密的聯繫。Americans want further access to Indian markets. This is a great place to do business and we want to give our people more access to this country.美國人希望進一步進入印度市場。這是一個做生意的好地方，我們希望讓我們的人民更多地接觸這個國家。And Indians, we believe, will thrive from greater commerce in the United States.我們相信，印度人將從在美國的更大規模商業活動中蓬勃發展。This is very much a win-win partnership. It certainly will be far into the future.這在很大程度上是一個雙贏的夥伴關係。在遙遠的未來肯定也是如此。And as I know this audience knows better than most, neither Americans nor Indians are alone in looking to scale up their manufacturing capacity.正如我知道在座各位比大多數人更清楚的，無論是美國人還是印度人，在尋求擴大製造業能力方面都不是孤單的。The competition extends well beyond cheap consumer goods競爭遠遠超出了廉價消費品，and into munitions, energy, infrastructure and all sorts of other cutting edge technologies.延伸到了彈藥、能源、基礎設施和各種其他尖端技術領域。I believe that if our nations fail to keep pace,我相信，如果我們兩國不能跟上步伐，the consequences for the Indo-Pacific, but really the consequences for the entire world will be quite dire.對印太地區的後果，但實際上對整個世界的後果都將是相當可怕的。And this, again, is where India and the United States have so much to offer one another.這再次說明了印度和美國可以互相提供如此之多。We’ve got great hardware, the leading artificial intelligence hardware in the world.我們擁有出色的硬件，世界領先的人工智能硬件。You have one of the most exciting startup technology infrastructures anywhere in the world.你們擁有世界上任何地方最令人興奮的初創科技基礎設施之一。There’s a lot to be gained by working together.通過合作可以獲益良多。And this is why President Trump and I both welcome India’s leadership in a number of diplomatic organizations, but of course in the Quad.這就是爲什麼特朗普總統和我本人都歡迎印度在一些外交組織中發揮領導作用，當然也包括在四方安全對話（Quad）中。We believe a stronger India means greater economic prosperity, but also greater stability across the Indo-Pacific,我們相信一個更強大的印度意味着更大的經濟繁榮，同時也意味着整個印太地區更大的穩定，which is, of course, a shared goal for all of us in this room and is a shared goal for both of our countries.這當然是在座各位的共同目標，也是我們兩國的共同目標。Now, I want to close with one last story or maybe a couple of stories.現在，我想用最後一個故事或者幾個故事來結束。So, you know, my son Ewan is seven years old. He’s our firstborn son.所以，你們知道，我的兒子伊萬（Ewan）七歲了。他是我們的長子。And yesterday after we had dinner at the Prime Minister’s house, the food was so good and the Prime Minister was so kind to our three children昨天我們在總理家吃過晚飯後，食物非常美味，總理對我們的三個孩子非常友善，that Ewan came up to me afterwards and he said, “Dad, you know, I think maybe I could live in India.”以至於伊萬後來走到我面前說：“爸爸，你知道嗎，我想也許我可以住在印度。”And, but I think after about 90 minutes in the Jaipur sun today at the great palace, he suggested that maybe we should move to England.但是，我想今天在齋浦爾的烈日下，在宏偉的宮殿裏待了大約90分鐘後，他建議也許我們應該搬到英國去。So you take the good with the bad here.所以在這裏你要接受好的，也要接受壞的。But I want to talk about Prime Minister Modi because I think he’s a special person.但我想談談莫迪總理，因爲我認爲他是一個特別的人。I first met Prime Minister Modi at the AI Action Summit in February,我第一次見到莫迪總理是在二月份的人工智能行動峯會上，and we had a lot of important discussions on AI and other policies to prepare for.我們就人工智能和其他需要準備的政策進行了許多重要的討論。The Prime Minister also managed to figure out that my son Vivek was actually turning five years old on the trip.總理還設法瞭解到我的兒子維韋克（Vivek）在那次旅途中正好滿五歲。This was in Paris just a couple of months ago.這是幾個月前在巴黎發生的事。So think about this. Amid a huge international policy conference,所以想想看。在一場大型國際政策會議期間，he took the time to stop by where I was staying, wish our second son Vivek a happy birthday, and even bring him a gift.他抽出時間來到我住的地方，祝我們的次子維韋克生日快樂，甚至還給他帶了禮物。Usha and I were both genuinely touched by his graciousness.烏莎和我都由衷地被他的親切所感動。And we’ve been even more impressed by his warmth since we arrived in India.自從我們抵達印度以來，我們對他的熱情更是印象深刻。Now, it’s interesting. Some of you may know that when you’re a politician, your kids spend almost as much time in the limelight as you do.現在，這很有趣。你們有些人可能知道，當你是個政治家時，你的孩子幾乎和你一樣多地暴露在聚光燈下。And the great things about kids is they are brutally honest.而關於孩子們的偉大之處在於他們非常誠實。They’re brutally honest with everybody, whether you want them to be or not.他們對每個人都非常誠實，不管你願不願意。And our seven-year-old, our five-year-old, and then our three-year-old baby girl Mirabelle, it’s interesting.我們七歲的、五歲的，還有我們三歲的小女兒米拉貝爾（Mirabelle），這很有趣。They have only really been, they’ve only really attached themselves to.他們真的只，他們真的只依附於。They’ve only really liked, I should say. They’ve only really built a rapport with two world leaders.我應該說，他們真的只喜歡。他們真的只和兩位世界領導人建立了融洽的關係。The first, of course, is President Trump. He just has a certain energy about him.第一位當然是特朗普總統。他身上就是有某種能量。But Prime Minister Modi, it’s the exact same thing.但莫迪總理，完全是一樣的。Our kids just like him. And I think that because kids are such good, strong judges of character,我們的孩子們就是喜歡他。我認爲，因爲孩子們是如此優秀的、敏銳的性格判斷者，I just like Prime Minister Modi, too. And I think it’s a great foundation for the future of our relationship.我也就喜歡莫迪總理。我認爲這是我們未來關係的一個良好基礎。I could tell then, I could tell when Prime Minister Modi came over a couple of months ago, and I believe today that he is a serious leader那時我就能看出來，當莫迪總理幾個月前來訪時我就能看出來，而且我相信今天，他是一位認真的領導人，who has thought deeply about India’s future prosperity and security,他深入思考了印度的未來繁榮與安全，not just for the rest of his time in office, but over the next century.不僅僅是在他剩餘的任期內，而是着眼於下一個世紀。And I want to end by making a simple overarching point.我想以一個簡單的 overarching 觀點來結束。We are now officially one quarter into the 21st century, 25 years in, 75 years to go.我們現在正式進入了21世紀的四分之一，25年過去了，還有75年。And I really believe that the future of the 21st century is going to be determined by the strength of the United States-India partnership.我真的相信，21世紀的未來將由美印夥伴關係的強度來決定。I believe, thank you.我相信，謝謝你們。I believe that if India and the United States work together successfully, we are going to see a 21st century that is prosperous and peaceful.我相信，如果印度和美國成功合作，我們將看到一個繁榮與和平的21世紀。But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21st century could be a very dark time for all of humanity.但我也相信，如果我們未能成功合作，21世紀可能成爲全人類一個非常黑暗的時期。So I want to say, it’s clear to me, as it is to most observers, that President Trump, of course, intends to rebalance所以我想說，對我來說很清楚，對大多數觀察者來說也是如此，特朗普總統當然打算重新平衡America’s economic relationship with the rest of the world.美國與世界其他地區的經濟關係。That’s going to cause, fundamentally will cause profound changes within our borders and the United States,這將導致，根本上將導致我們邊境內和美國的深刻變化，but of course with other countries as well.當然也包括其他國家。But I believe that this rebalancing is going to produce great benefits for American workers.但我相信這種重新平衡將爲美國工人帶來巨大的利益。It’s going to produce great benefits for the people of India.它將爲印度人民帶來巨大的利益。And because our partnership is so important to the future of the world, I believe President Trump’s efforts,因爲我們的夥伴關係對世界的未來如此重要，我相信特朗普總統的努力，joined, of course, by the whole country of India and Prime Minister Modi,當然，還有整個印度國家和莫迪總理的共同參與，will make the 21st century the best century in human history.將使21世紀成爲人類歷史上最好的世紀。Let’s do it together. God bless you and thank you for having me.讓我們一起努力。上帝保佑你們，感謝你們邀請我。 【核心词汇 - B1_C2】 單詞 音標 詞性 釋義 等級 次數 able &#x2F;ˈeɪbl&#x2F; adjective 能夠；有能力的 B1 1 access &#x2F;ˈækses&#x2F; noun 進入；通道；使用權 B1 1

Trump campaigned on the promise to secure our homeland特朗普總統競選時承諾要保護我們的國土安全，and deport violent alien criminals from our communities.並將暴力外籍罪犯驅逐出我們的社區。That is why the American people overwhelmingly reelected him back to this office,這就是爲什麼美國人民以壓倒性優勢再次選舉他回到這個職位，and it’s why the American people defeated the Democrat Party in devastating fashion.也是爲什麼美國人民以毀滅性的方式擊敗了民主黨。Today we have officially learned Democrat officials still refuse to accept今天我們正式獲悉，民主黨官員仍然拒絕接受the will of the American people.美國人民的意願。Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen rushed to Dulles Airport this morning馬里蘭州民主黨參議員克里斯·範·霍倫今天早上趕往杜勒斯機場，to fly to El Salvador, potentially using taxpayer dollars飛往薩爾瓦多，可能會使用納稅人的錢，to demand the release of deported, illegal alien MS-13 terrorists.要求釋放被驅逐的非法外籍MS-13恐怖分子。The Democrats and the media in this room have continually and wrongly labeled在場的民主黨人和媒體一直錯誤地稱Kilmar Ebrego Garcia as a Maryland father.基爾馬·埃佈雷戈·加西亞爲馬里蘭州父親。There is no Maryland father.沒有馬里蘭州父親。Let me reiterate, Kilmar Ebrego Garcia is an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member,讓我重申，基爾馬·埃佈雷戈·加西亞是一個非法外籍、MS-13幫派成員，and foreign terrorist who was deported back to his home country.以及被驅逐回其祖國的外國恐怖分子。And when Kilmar Ebrego Garcia was originally arrested,當基爾馬·埃佈雷戈·加西亞最初被逮捕時，he was wearing a sweatshirt with rolls of money covering the ears, mouth, and eyes他穿着一件毛衫，上面有成卷的錢覆蓋着耳朵、嘴巴和眼睛，of presidents on various currency denominations.這些是各種貨幣面額上的總統頭像。This is a known MS-13 gang symbol of hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil.這是MS-13幫派的已知標誌，象徵不聽惡、不言惡、不見惡。Ebrego Garcia was also arrested with two other well-known members埃佈雷戈·加西亞還與另外兩名臭名昭著的of the vicious MS-13 gang.惡毒MS-13幫派成員一起被逮捕。And two separate judges found that Ebrego Garcia was a member of MS-13,兩名不同的法官認定埃佈雷戈·加西亞是MS-13的成員，and that finding has never been disputed.這一認定從未被爭議。And just this morning, it was revealed through Maryland court documents今天早上，通過馬里蘭州法院文件披露，that Ebrego Garcia’s wife petitioned for an order of protection against him埃佈雷戈·加西亞的妻子曾申請對他的人身保護令，for two instances of domestic violence in May of 2021.因2021年5月的兩起家庭暴力事件。And here is the order right here.這裏就是那份保護令。The court ordered that the respondent committed the following acts of abuse.法院裁定被告實施了以下虐待行爲。Once in May of 2021, assaults in any degree.2021年5月一次，任何程度的襲擊。And on May 4th of 2021, he punched and scratched his wife,2021年5月4日，他拳打併抓傷了他的妻子，ripped off her shirt, and grabbed and bruised her.撕下她的襯衫，抓住並使她瘀傷。This is from a court in Maryland.這是來自馬里蘭州法院的記錄。So not only are Democrats rushing to defend an illegal criminal foreign terrorist gang member,因此，民主黨人不僅急於爲一個非法的外國恐怖幫派成員辯護，but also an apparent woman beater.而且顯然還是一個虐待女性的傢伙。To set all of that aside, the basic fact that he was illegally inside our country撇開這一切，基本事實是他非法進入我們的國家，and had a lawful deportation order made him subject to removal並且有合法的驅逐令，使他必須被驅逐back to his home country of El Salvador.回到他的祖國薩爾瓦多。And if he ever ends up back in the United States,如果他再次回到美國，he would immediately be deported again.他將立即再次被驅逐。Nothing will change the fact that Ebrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father.沒有什麼能改變埃佈雷戈·加西亞永遠不會是馬里蘭州父親的事實。He will never live in the United States of America again.他將永遠不會再次在美國生活。And the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously美國最高法院一致裁定，that the president of the United States and the secretary of state美國總統和國務卿could not be compelled to forcibly retrieve this citizen of El Salvador,不能被強迫強行接回這個薩爾瓦多公民，who is currently locked up in a maximum security prison in his home country他目前被關押在祖國的最高安全級別監獄中，due to his MS-13 membership.因爲他是MS-13的成員。To remind the media and the Democrat Party,提醒媒體和民主黨，MS-13 are among the most vicious and dangerous individuals in this world.MS-13是這個世界上最爲惡毒和危險的個體之一。They pose a direct threat to the United States, El Salvador,他們對美國、薩爾瓦多and any other country who maintains basic law and order.以及任何維持基本法律和秩序的國家構成直接威脅。MS-13 rapes innocent girls and women, runs sex trafficking operations,MS-13強姦無辜的女孩和婦女，經營性交易，murders for sport, and terrorizes law-abiding people.爲娛樂而謀殺，恐嚇守法的人。That’s why El Salvador President Bukele made it clear this week這就是爲什麼薩爾瓦多總統布克爾本週明確表示that he will not be releasing this MS-13 gang member from his prison.他不會從監獄中釋放這個MS-13幫派成員。But that is not enough.但這還不夠。All of that is not enough to stop the Democrat Party from their lies.這一切不足以阻止民主黨散佈謊言。The number one issue they are focused on right now他們目前關注的首要問題is bringing back this illegal alien terrorist to America.是將這個非法外籍恐怖分子帶回美國。But where are the Democrats applauding the fact但民主黨人在哪裏爲這一事實鼓掌，that southern border crossings just hit a historic low?南部邊境過境人數剛剛達到歷史最低點？Where are the Democrats supporting our brave men and women of law enforcement民主黨人在哪裏支持我們勇敢的執法人員，who are putting their lives on the line every single day他們每天都在冒着生命危險to arrest the violent illegal alien invaders逮捕暴力的非法外籍入侵者，that the previous administration allowed into our country?這些是前任政府允許進入我們國家的人？And where are the Democrats when innocent Americans民主黨人在哪裏，當無辜的美國人are victimized by illegal criminals that Joe Biden let in?被喬·拜登放進來的非法罪犯傷害時？It’s appalling and sad that

the southwest border for the entire month of March 2025根據美國海關和邊境保護局的數據，2025 年 3 月整個月在西南邊境的邊境巡邏逮捕人數were lower than the first two days of March 2024 under Joe Biden.低於喬·拜登執政下 2024 年 3 月的前兩天。Incredible law enforcement officers are arresting violent illegal aliens from American communities every day.令人難以置信的執法人員每天都在美國社區逮捕暴力的非法外國人。Here are a few examples from the latest ICE report, which I received this morning.以下是我今天早上收到的最新 ICE 報告中的幾個例子。ICE Los Angeles arrested a 54-year-old citizen of Mexico convicted of rape by threat, sodomy with a person under 14 years, and kidnapping in San Jose, California.洛杉磯移民與海關執法局逮捕了一名 54 歲的墨西哥公民，他在加利福尼亞州聖何塞被判犯有威脅強姦罪、與 14 歲以下人士進行雞姦罪以及綁架罪。ICE Houston has arrested a 23-year-old citizen of Mexico convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child in

64 歲的洪都拉斯公民，他在加利福尼亞州洛杉磯縣被判犯有謀殺罪。ICE Chicago arrested a 49-year-old citizen of Guatemala convicted of assault and arson in Prince William County, Virginia, not far from here.芝加哥移民與海關執法局逮捕了一名 49 歲的危地馬拉公民，他在離此地不遠的弗吉尼亞州威廉王子縣被判犯有襲擊和縱火罪。ICE Denver arrested a 36-year-old citizen of Mexico who is registered as a sex offender and has been convicted of sexual assault of a child in Lake County,

and battery of a child under 14 in Boston, Massachusetts.以及兩項在馬薩諸塞州波士頓對 14 歲以下兒童進行猥褻攻擊和毆打的罪名。President Trump and our administration will not rest until every single violent, illegal alien is removed from our country.特朗普總統和我們的政府不會休息，直到每一個暴力的非法外國人被驅逐出我們的國家。The safety of the American people is too important to settle for anything less.美國人民的安全太重要了，絕不能有任何妥協。On that note, the Democrat and media outrage over the deportation of Abrego Garcia, an MS-13 El Salvadorian, an illegal alien criminal who is hiding in Maryland,關於這一點，民主黨和媒體對 Abrego Garcia 被驅逐出境的憤怒，他是一名 MS-13 薩爾瓦多人，一個藏匿在馬里蘭州的非法外籍罪犯，has been nothing short of despicable.簡直是卑鄙無恥。Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room, you would think we deported a candidate for Father of the Year.根據這個房間裏許多人的聳人聽聞的說法，你會以爲我們驅逐了一位年度父親獎的候選人。That’s because, unfortunately, many in this country care more about this quote-unquote Maryland father, an illegal alien MS-13 gang member,那是因爲，不幸的是，這個國家的許多人更關心這位所謂的“馬里蘭父親”，一個非法的 MS-13 幫派成員，than a Maryland mother and an American citizen who was brutally murdered at the hands of a different illegal alien.而不是一位馬里蘭州的母親和美國公民，她被另一名非法外國人殘忍殺害。Of course, I am referring to Rachel Morin.當然，我指的是雷切爾·莫林。And if you didn’t see yesterday, a Maryland jury found illegal alien Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez guilty of murdering Rachel Morin in August of 2023.如果你昨天沒看到，馬里蘭州的一個陪審團裁定非法外國人維克多·安東尼奧·馬丁內斯·埃爾南德斯於 2023 年 8 月謀殺雷切爾·莫林罪名成立。She was a 37-year-old mother of five who was jogging in an otherwise safe community northeast of Baltimore她是一位 37 歲的五個孩子的母親，當時正在巴爾的摩東北部一個原本安全的社區慢跑，when this monster ambushed, strangled, and beat her to death before stuffing her brutalized body in a tunnel drain.結果這個怪物伏擊、勒死並將她毆打致死，然後把她飽受摧殘的屍體塞進了一個隧道排水管。The Morin family finally got justice yesterday, but they will never get Rachel back.莫林一家昨天終於得到了正義，但他們永遠也無法讓雷切爾回來了。Our hearts go out to Rachel’s family, her five children, and her mother, Patty, who has suffered the unimaginable loss of her daughter.我們向雷切爾的家人、她的五個孩子以及她的母親帕蒂表示慰問，她承受了失去女兒的難以想象的痛苦。In case you missed it last week, President Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum以防你上週錯過了，特朗普總統簽署了一份國家安全總統備忘錄，directing federal agencies administering federal land on the border to make land available to the Defense Department in a new national defense area.指示管理邊境聯邦土地的聯邦機構將土地提供給國防部，用於一個新的國防區域。This followed the President’s Day One Executive Order, committing his administration to marshal all available resources and authorities在此之前，總統發佈了“第一天”行政命令，承諾其政府將調動所有可用資源和權力，to stop the unprecedented flood of illegal aliens into our country and to obtain complete operational control of the borders of the United States of America.以阻止前所未有的非法外國人涌入我們國家，並獲得對美利堅合衆國邊境的完全行動控制權。Once again, the President is fulfilling another key promise.總統再次履行了另一項關鍵承諾。This new national defense area spans more than 170 miles across our border in New Mexico,這個新的國防區域橫跨我們在新墨西哥州的邊境超過 170 英里，but in the coming weeks, this administration will add more than 90 miles in the state of Texas.但在未來幾周內，本屆政府將在德克薩斯州增加超過 90 英里。This national defense area will enhance our ability to detect, interdict, and prosecute the illegal aliens, criminal gangs, and terrorists這個國防區域將增強我們探測、攔截和起訴非法外國人、犯罪團伙和恐怖分子的能力，who were able to invade our country without consequence for the past four years under the Biden administration.這些人在過去四年拜登政府執政期間能夠毫無後果地入侵我們的國家。It will also bolster our defenses against fentanyl and other dangerous narcotics that have been poisoning our communities.它還將加強我們對芬太尼和其他一直毒害我們社區的危險麻醉品的防禦。With all of this work being done to make America great again, we continue to see a positive response from the American public.隨着所有這些讓美國再次偉大的工作正在進行，我們繼續看到美國公衆的積極反應。A brand new poll published from the Daily Mail and JL Partners this morning found that President Trump’s approval rating is at an all-time high.今天早上《每日郵報》和 JL Partners 發佈的一項全新民意調查發現，特朗普總統的支持率達到了歷史最高水平。That’s because the President is working tirelessly to keep his promises to the American people, as I just saw him doing today in the Oval Office.那是因爲總統正在不懈地努力履行他對美國人民的承諾，就像我今天在橢圓形辦公室看到他所做的那樣。We have a reporter in our new media seat today, Matthew Foldy, who is the editor-in-chief of the Washington Reporter.今天我們的新媒體席位上有一位記者，馬修·福爾迪，他是《華盛頓報道者》的主編。I like your boots, Matt.我喜歡你的靴子，馬特。Washington Reporter is a new, fast-growing outlet that breaks stories about legislation and interviews leaders in Congress and across the administration.《華盛頓報道者》是一家新興的、快速發展的媒體機構，報道有關立法的新聞，並採訪國會和整個政府的領導人。The publication’s readership includes the highest levels of business and government.該刊物的讀者羣包括商界和政界的最高層人士。And with that, please kick us off, Matt.那麼，請開始吧，馬特。And we’ve interviewed you as well.我們也採訪過你。So Caroline, thanks so much for having me here on behalf of our readership and the millions of Americans卡羅琳，非常感謝你邀請我來到這裏，我代表我們的讀者以及數百萬美國人，who I think appreciate what you’re doing with the new media seat here and making this a more accessible briefing room.我想他們很欣賞你在這裏設立新媒體席位所做的工作，讓這個簡報室變得更容易進入。I’m curious, with Harvard, we saw the Trump administration today announce it’s cutting around $2 billion in funds from Harvard我很好奇，關於哈佛大學，我們看到特朗普政府今天宣佈削減哈佛大學約 20 億美元的資金，because the campus has serious problems with violence and with anti-Semitism.因爲該校園存在嚴重的暴力和反猶太主義問題。We saw former President Obama side with Harvard, which rejected the Trump administration’s demands.我們看到前總統奧巴馬站在哈佛一邊，哈佛拒絕了特朗普政府的要求。I’m curious, where does the administration see this going with Harvard and with other colleges and universities in America我很好奇，政府認爲哈佛以及美國其他學院和大學的情況會如何發展，that are refusing to reform in the wake of the sort of craziness that we’ve seen take over some of them?這些學校在我們看到的那種瘋狂席捲其中一些之後拒絕改革？Thank you, Matt, for being here, and thanks for the question.謝謝你，馬特，感謝你來到這裏，也感謝你的提問。When it comes to Harvard, the President’s position on this is grounded in common sense.在哈佛問題上，總統的立場是基於常識的。In the basic principle that Jewish American students or students of any faith should not be illegally harassed and targeted on our nation’s college campuses.基於一個基本原則，即猶太裔美國學生或任何信仰的學生都不應在我國大學校園內受到非法騷擾和針對。And we unfortunately saw that illegal discrimination take place on the campus of Harvard.不幸的是，我們看到這種非法歧視發生在哈佛校園。There are countless examples to prove it, particularly with the stunning confession by then Harvard President Claudine Gay,有無數的例子可以證明這一點，尤其是當時哈佛校長克勞丁·蓋伊令人震驚的供述，who said that bullying and harassment depended on the context.她說欺凌和騷擾取決於具體情況。The President at that time made it clear to the American public he was not going to tolerate illegal harassment and anti-Semitism taking place in violation of federal law.當時的總統向美國公衆明確表示，他不會容忍違反聯邦法律的非法騷擾和反猶太主義行爲發生。So the President made it clear to Harvard, follow federal law, no longer break Title VI,所以總統向哈佛明確表示，遵守聯邦法律，不再違反第六章，which was passed by Congress to ensure no student can be discriminated against on the basis of race, and you will receive federal funding.該法案由國會通過，以確保沒有學生因種族而受到歧視，這樣你們就能獲得聯邦資助。Unfortunately, Harvard has not taken the President or the administration’s demands seriously.不幸的是，哈佛沒有認真對待總統或政府的要求。All the President is asking is this: don’t break federal law, and then you can have your federal funding.總統所要求的就是：不要違反聯邦法律，然後你就可以得到你的聯邦資助。I think the President is also raising a good question.我認爲總統也提出了一個好問題。More than $2 billion out the door to Harvard when they have a more than $50 billion endowment.給哈佛超過 20 億美元，而他們擁有超過 500 億美元的捐贈基金。Why are the American taxpayers subsidizing a university that has billions of dollars in the bank already?爲什麼美國納稅人要補貼一所銀行裏已經有數十億美元的大學？And we certainly should not be funding a place where such grave anti-Semitism exists.我們當然不應該資助一個存在如此嚴重反猶太主義的地方。I’m curious, you’ve just mentioned Rachel Morin.我很好奇，你剛纔提到了雷切爾·莫林。I’m a Maryland man and I think most Marylanders appreciate what you were saying today.我是馬里蘭人，我想大多數馬里蘭人都贊同你今天所說的話。You’ve seen Chris Van Hollen, who was Rachel Morin’s senator, basically threatening to fly to El Salvador你看到克里斯·範霍倫，他是雷切爾·莫林的參議員，基本上威脅要飛往薩爾瓦多，to press for the release of someone who was in America illegally.爲一個非法在美國的人的釋放施壓。Not as much from him about Rachel Morin’s horrific murder and the verdict that was, I think, rightly reached yesterday.而關於雷切爾·莫林的可怕謀殺案以及我認爲昨天正確達成的判決，他卻沒怎麼說。What does the administration think about the priorities we’re seeing from Senate Democrats政府對我們看到的參議院民主黨人的優先事項有何看法，in terms of illegal immigrants instead of the work that agencies like ICE and DHS are doing with the Trump administration?他們關注非法移民，而不是像 ICE 和 DHS 這樣的機構與特朗普政府正在做的工作？It’s mind-boggling, the priorities of the modern-day Democrat Party.現代民主黨的優先事項真是令人難以置信。I think it’s atrocious that you have Democrats in Congress on Capitol Hill who swear an oath to protect their constituents and to serve them in Washington, D.C.,我認爲這太殘忍了，國會山上的民主黨議員宣誓保護他們的選民並在華盛頓特區爲他們服務，spending more time defending illegal immigrant gang members than their own constituents and law-abiding American citizens like Rachel Morin.卻花費更多時間爲非法移民幫派成員辯護，而不是爲他們自己的選民和像雷切爾·莫林這樣守法的美國公民辯護。I saw the President personally on the campaign trail and I continue to see him in his role as President of the United States put American families first,我在競選活動中親眼看到總統，並繼續看到他作爲美國總統將美國家庭放在首位，reach out to the victims, the families of victims at the hands of illegal immigrant crime,接觸受害者，那些因非法移民犯罪而受害的家庭，and frankly the actions and the words of the Democrat Party prove they could not care less about the American public.坦率地說，民主黨的行動和言辭證明他們根本不關心美國公衆。Maybe if they did, they’d see a bit higher approval ratings right now.也許如果他們關心的話，他們現在的支持率會高一些。Thanks for being here with us today. Peter.感謝你今天和我們在一起。彼得。Thank you, Caroline.謝謝你，卡羅琳。To follow up on something that you just said, why do Ivy League schools get so much federal funding?接着你剛纔說的話題，爲什麼常春藤盟校能獲得如此多的聯邦資助？It’s a very good question and it’s a question the President has obviously raised in his discussions and negotiations這是一個很好的問題，總統顯然在他與哈佛、哥倫比亞以及許多其他常春藤盟校機構的with not just Harvard but also Columbia and many other Ivy League institutions.討論和談判中提出過這個問題。We have the anti-Semitism task force, which the President promised and delivered on.我們有反猶太主義特別工作組，這是總統承諾並兌現的。The anti-Semitism task force is across the government, representatives from various federal agencies who meet on a weekly basis反猶太主義特別工作組遍佈政府各部門，來自各個聯邦機構的代表每週開會，to discuss the question that you just raised.討論你剛纔提出的問題。I think a lot of Americans are wondering why their tax dollars are going to these universities我想很多美國人都在想，爲什麼他們的稅款會流向這些大學，when they are not only indoctrinating our nation’s students but also allowing such egregious, illegal behavior to occur.而這些大學不僅在給我們的學生灌輸思想，還允許如此惡劣、非法的行爲發生。To follow up on immigration, deporting American citizens to Central American prisons, is it legal or do you need to change the law to do it?接着談移民問題，將美國公民驅逐到中美洲監獄，這合法嗎？還是需要修改法律才能這樣做？Well it’s another question that the President has raised.嗯，這是總統提出的另一個問題。It’s a legal question that the President is looking into.這是一個總統正在研究的法律問題。He talked about this yesterday with his meeting with President Bukele in the Oval Office.他昨天在橢圓形辦公室與布克爾總統會面時談到了這個問題。He would only consider this, if legal, for Americans who are the most violent, egregious, repeat offenders of crime他只會在合法的情況下考慮對那些最暴力、最惡劣、屢次犯罪的美國人採取這種措施，who nobody in this room wants living in their communities.也就是這個房間裏沒人希望他們住在自己社區的人。Then there’s this CHNV thing.然後是這個 CHNV 的事情。President Biden let more than 530,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela into the U.S. with this CHNV program.拜登總統通過這個 CHNV 項目讓超過 53 萬來自古巴、海地、尼加拉瓜、委內瑞拉的人進入美國。He did it with the stroke of a pen and now a judge will not let President Trump undo it with the stroke of a pen.他大筆一揮就做到了，現在一個法官卻不允許特朗普總統大筆一揮來撤銷它。So are you guys going to give all 530,000 plus people individual deportation hearings or are you just going to try to deport them?那麼你們是打算給所有這 53 萬多人進行單獨的驅逐聽證會，還是就直接嘗試驅逐他們？I spoke to White House Counsel’s Office about this this morning because obviously another rogue district court judge我今天早上和白宮法律顧問辦公室談了這件事，因爲顯然又有一個流氓地方法院法官is trying to block the administration’s mass deportation efforts with this latest injunction.正試圖用這個最新的禁令來阻止政府的大規模驅逐行動。We will fight this in the court of law and we will ensure that every individual who illegally entered our country我們將在法庭上對此進行抗爭，我們將確保每一個非法進入我們國家的人，and was really taken advantage of by the previous administration because they abused the parole system in this country並且確實被前任政府利用的人，因爲他們濫用了這個國家的假釋制度，to fast-track what they called legal status for these illegal immigrants.來爲這些非法移民快速辦理他們所謂的合法身份。And they completely abused our legal system.他們完全濫用了我們的法律體系。Many of these paroled individuals were then given temporary protective status,許多這些被假釋的人隨後獲得了臨時保護身份，which the intention of that TPS was only supposed to be used in times of war or storm or destruction in the home countries of these migrants.而臨時保護身份（TPS）的初衷本應只在這些移民的母國發生戰爭、風暴或破壞時使用。It was completely abused.它被完全濫用了。These migrants came here for economic reasons and they illegally entered our country and the President is not going to tolerate that.這些移民是出於經濟原因來到這裏的，他們非法進入了我們的國家，總統不會容忍這種情況。And so we will continue to focus on deporting as many individuals as we can. Jennifer.因此，我們將繼續專注於盡可能多地驅逐個人。詹妮弗。One on tariffs and one on Russia.一個關於關稅，一個關於俄羅斯。Can you give us any sort of an update on which deals are in hand or are close? Which countries are reaching a deal on tariffs?你能告訴我們哪些協議已經達成或接近達成嗎？哪些國家正在就關稅達成協議？And then on Russia, can you give us an update on what the agreement was with Russia?然後關於俄羅斯，你能告訴我們與俄羅斯達成的協議是什麼嗎？The President yesterday said that he thinks we’ll be seeing some very good deals very soon.總統昨天說他認爲我們很快就會看到一些非常好的協議。Can you talk a little bit about what Russia agreed to?你能談談俄羅斯同意了什麼嗎？Sure.當然。I don’t want to get ahead of our United States Trade Representative and Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Treasury,我不想搶在美國貿易代表、商務部長和財政部長，all the great individuals who are working incredibly hard to cut these good trade deals.所有這些爲達成這些良好貿易協議而辛勤工作的偉大人物之前（宣佈消息）。And the President is deeply involved in this as well.總統也深入參與其中。He has made it clear to his trade team, he wants to personally sign off on all of these deals too.他已經向他的貿易團隊明確表示，他也希望親自簽署所有這些協議。And so I don’t want to get ahead of them on announcements.所以我不想在他們宣佈之前搶先發布消息。But obviously as you’ve heard from numerous administration officials, there have been many talks with countries.但顯然，正如你從許多政府官員那裏聽到的，我們已經與許多國家進行了多次會談。We’ve had more than 15 deals, pieces of paper put on the table, proposals that are actively being considered.我們已經有超過 15 項協議、擺在桌面上的文件、正在積極考慮的提案。And as we’ve said consistently, more than 75 countries have reached out. So there’s a lot of work to do.正如我們一直所說，已有超過 75 個國家與我們聯繫。所以還有很多工作要做。We very much understand that. But we do believe that we can announce some deals very soon.我們非常理解這一點。但我們確實相信很快就能宣佈一些協議。And then on Russia, can you say did Russia agree to anything with Special Envoy Steve Witkoff?然後關於俄羅斯，你能說俄羅斯是否與特使史蒂夫·威特科夫達成了任何協議？I don’t want to get ahead of those negotiations as well.我也不想在那些談判有結果之前透露信息。What I can tell you is that a productive conversation was had.我能告訴你的是進行了一次富有成效的對話。As the presidential envoy Steve Witkoff said last night, he believes that Russia wants to end this war, and the President believes that as well.正如總統特使史蒂夫·威特科夫昨晚所說，他相信俄羅斯希望結束這場戰爭，總統也相信這一點。There is incentive for Russia to end this war.俄羅斯有結束這場戰爭的動機。And perhaps that could be economic partnerships with the United States. But we need to see a ceasefire first.也許這可能是與美國的經濟夥伴關係。但我們首先需要看到停火。And the President and the presidential envoy Witkoff made that very clear to the Russians. Gabe.總統和總統特使威特科夫已經非常明確地向俄國人說明了這一點。蓋比。Thank you, Caroline.謝謝你，卡羅琳。And I also want to thank your press office for releasing that information that you cited up there regarding the ICE arrests over the last couple of days.我還要感謝你的新聞辦公室發佈了你剛纔引用的關於過去幾天 ICE 逮捕行動的信息。I have them right here, but what I might ask is why not release the same information for those who were deported to El Salvador?我這裏就有這些信息，但我想問的是，爲什麼不發佈關於那些被驅逐到薩爾瓦多的人的同樣信息呢？Well first of all, the information was released by the Department of Homeland Security.嗯，首先，這些信息是由國土安全部發布的。The individuals on the flights to El Salvador are foreign terrorists, and those are counter-terrorism operations.飛往薩爾瓦多的航班上的人是外國恐怖分子，那些是反恐行動。They are much different than the arrests and final orders of removal that you see on a day-to-day basis that law enforcement agents are conducting around the country.這與你日常看到的執法人員在全國範圍內進行的逮捕和最終驅逐令有很大不同。That information, to that detail, was not released by DHS?那些信息，具體到那種程度，不是由國土安全部發布的嗎？I just told you the reason.我剛纔告訴過你原因了。It was a counter-terrorism operation, a deportation of foreign terrorists, not illegal alien criminals who have been convicted of heinous crimes living in our American communities.這是一次反恐行動，驅逐的是外國恐怖分子，而不是那些在我們美國社區生活、被判犯有滔天罪行的非法外籍罪犯。Two different things. Foreign terrorists, illegal immigrant criminal.兩回事。外國恐怖分子，非法移民罪犯。Two different things, two different definitions. You should look them up. Christian, go ahead.兩回事，兩種不同的定義。你應該查一下。克里斯蒂安，請講。Yeah, thanks Caroline.是的，謝謝卡羅琳。Does the President support raising the corporate tax rate to pay for all these other tax cuts he wants to see move through Congress?總統是否支持提高公司稅率來支付他希望在國會通過的所有其他減稅措施？Look, I’ve seen this idea proposed. I’ve heard this idea discussed,聽着，我看到過這個提議。我聽到過這個想法被討論，but I don’t believe the President has made a determination on whether he supports it or not.但我不認爲總統已經決定是否支持它。And then secondly, do you have any information on the status of Eden Alexander?其次，你是否有關於伊登·亞歷山大狀況的任何信息？Hamas says they lost contact with the unit guarding him following an Israeli airstrike earlier today.哈馬斯稱，在今天早些時候以色列的一次空襲之後，他們與看守他的部隊失去了聯繫。I don’t have updates. I have not seen that report, but I can certainly check in with our National Security Council.我沒有最新消息。我沒有看到那份報告，但我肯定可以向我們的國家安全委員會覈實。I have spoken to the President about Eden Alexander, and he’s made it very clear to our national security team that finding him is a priority,我已經和總統談過伊登·亞歷山大的事，他已經非常明確地向我們的國家安全團隊表示，找到他是優先事項，but unfortunately I don’t have any updates to share.但不幸的是，我沒有任何最新消息可以分享。But it’s a very important matter, and certainly we can check in. Sure.但這是一個非常重要的問題，我們肯定會去核實。當然。Hi.嗨。Hi.嗨。How concerned is the President that a federal judge could hold a Trump administration official in contempt of court for defying deportation orders?總統有多擔心聯邦法官會因藐視驅逐令而判特朗普政府官員藐視法庭罪？We are complying with all court orders.我們正在遵守所有法院命令。So I see what you’re trying to do there with that question, but we’re very confident that every action taken by this administration is within the confines of the law,所以我明白你那個問題的意圖，但我們非常有信心，本屆政府採取的每一項行動都在法律允許的範圍內，and we continue to comply with the court’s orders, and you have seen that.我們繼續遵守法院的命令，這一點你已經看到了。And the President made that clear yesterday in the Oval Office with President Bukele. Sure.總統昨天在橢圓形辦公室與布克爾總統會面時也明確了這一點。當然。Thanks, Caroline.謝謝，卡羅琳。Could you, just going back to El Salvador, could you just explain to us a little bit more about the legal basis on which you may be able to send U.S. citizens to prison there?你能否，回到薩爾瓦多的話題，再向我們解釋一下，你們可能將美國公民送往那裏監獄的法律依據是什麼？I know you said that President Trump is looking at it, but can you explain to us a little bit more about how that might be possible?我知道你說過特朗普總統正在研究這個問題，但你能否再向我們解釋一下這怎麼可能實現？We’re looking at it, and when I have more for you to share, I certainly will. Sure.我們正在研究，當我有了更多可以分享的信息時，我一定會告訴你們。當然。Hi.嗨。Hey.嘿。Still going off the El Salvador questions.還是關於薩爾瓦多的問題。Yesterday in the Oval Office, administration officials made it very clear that El Salvador is responsible for Mr. Abrego Garcia,昨天在橢圓形辦公室，政府官員非常明確地表示薩爾瓦多對阿布雷戈·加西亞先生負責，yet El Salvador’s President said we are, we’re not going to do anything with him.但薩爾瓦多總統說我們不會對他採取任何行動。So my question is, who is responsible for this man and where he’s going to end up?所以我的問題是，誰對這個人負責，他最終會去哪裏？Well, no. First of all, President Bukele said that he is not going to smuggle a foreign terrorist back into the United States of America,嗯，不是的。首先，布克爾總統說了，他不會把一個外國恐怖分子偷運回美利堅合衆國，as many in this room in the Democrat Party seemingly want him to do.就像這個房間里民主黨的許多人似乎希望他做的那樣。Abrego Garcia was a foreign terrorist. He is an MS-13 gang member. He was engaged in human trafficking. He illegally came into our country.阿布雷戈·加西亞是一名外國恐怖分子。他是 MS-13 幫派成員。他參與了人口販賣。他非法進入了我們的國家。And so deporting him back to El Salvador was always going to be the end result.所以把他驅逐回薩爾瓦多一直都是最終的結果。There is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who is going to live a peaceful life in Maryland永遠不可能存在這樣一個世界：這個人能在馬里蘭州過上平靜的生活，because he is a foreign terrorist and an MS-13 gang member.因爲他是一個外國恐怖分子和 MS-13 幫派成員。Not only have we confirmed that, President Bukele yesterday in the Oval Office confirmed that as well.不僅我們證實了這一點，布克爾總統昨天在橢圓形辦公室也證實了這一點。So he went back to his home country where he will face consequences for his gang affiliation and his engagement in human trafficking.所以他回到了他的祖國，在那裏他將因其幫派關係和參與人口販賣而面臨後果。I’m not sure what is so difficult about this for everyone in the media to understand.我不確定爲什麼媒體中的每個人都這麼難理解這一點。And it’s appalling, truly appalling, that there has been so much time covering this alleged human trafficker and this gang member, MS-13 gang member.而且，花了這麼多時間報道這個所謂的人口販子和這個幫派成員，MS-13 幫派成員，這真是令人震驚，確實令人震驚。It’s truly striking to me. Karen.這真的讓我感到震驚。凱倫。Thank you, Caroline. The President was posting on Truth Social today about helping American farmers.謝謝你，卡羅琳。總統今天在 Truth Social 上發帖談論幫助美國農民。And last week in his Cabinet meeting he was talking about a plan to work with farmers, to retain workers who are in the U.S. illegally,上週在他的內閣會議上，他談到了一個與農民合作的計劃，以留住非法在美國的工人，provided that they leave and then come back through what he said would be a legal process.條件是他們先離開，然後通過他所說的合法程序回來。Can you give details on what that would look like, how many workers he’s talking about, how long a plan like that would take to implement,你能提供關於這個計劃具體細節嗎，比如它會是什麼樣子，他指的是多少工人，實施這樣的計劃需要多長時間，and the timeline for more details on getting this actually to implementation?以及獲得更多關於實際實施細節的時間表？I can check in with our immigration and our policy team and get you some more details on that, Karen.我可以和我們的移民和政策團隊覈實一下，然後給你提供更多細節，凱倫。And is he, is this something he wants to roll out soon? I mean, he was talking back and forth with Secretary Rawlins. Right.他是不是想盡快推出這個計劃？我的意思是，他當時在和羅林斯部長來回討論。是的。This is kind of imminent that he wants to do this.這看起來像是他馬上就要做的事情。Yeah, look, the President is in constant communication with all of his Cabinet Secretaries, particularly Secretary Rawlins,是的，聽着，總統一直與他所有的內閣部長保持溝通，特別是羅林斯部長，who has the backs of American farmers and ranchers.她支持美國的農民和牧場主。It’s something that he spoke about with her in the front of all the cameras in the Cabinet Room.這是他在內閣會議室裏當着所有攝像機和她談論過的事情。But I’ll check in with not only our immigration team, but also with USDA and we’ll get you an answer. Jonathan.但我不僅會和我們的移民團隊覈實，還會和美國農業部覈實，然後給你答覆。喬納森。Hi, Caroline. Hi. It’s good to see you in here. You too.嗨，卡羅琳。嗨。很高興在這裏見到你。你也是。The President has long said that it would be an abuse of power for a President to direct prosecutors to investigate him.總統長期以來一直表示，總統指示檢察官調查自己是濫用權力。Last week, President Trump explicitly directed the Justice Department to scrutinize Chris Krebs to see if it can find any evidence of criminal wrongdoing.上週，特朗普總統明確指示司法部審查克里斯·克雷布斯，看是否能找到任何犯罪行爲的證據。How is that not an abuse of power to direct the Justice Department to look into an individual, a named individual?指示司法部調查一個具體的、指名道姓的個人，這怎麼不算是濫用權力呢？Look, the President signed that executive order.聽着，總統簽署了那項行政命令。It’s the position of the President in this White House that it’s well within his authority to do it.這位總統在這個白宮的立場是，這樣做完全在他的權力範圍之內。Otherwise, he wouldn’t have signed it. And he signed it and that’s his policy. Jeff, how are you doing?否則，他就不會簽署它。他簽署了，這就是他的政策。傑夫，你好嗎？Fine, thanks. Thanks, Caroline. A follow-up on Harvard.很好，謝謝。謝謝，卡羅琳。一個關於哈佛的後續問題。The President floated on Truth Social the possibility of removing tax-exempt status.總統在 Truth Social 上提出了取消免稅地位的可能性。How serious is that threat, and are other universities being considered?這個威脅有多嚴重？是否也在考慮其他大學？And then a follow-up question on foreign policy.然後是一個關於外交政策的後續問題。Can you give us an update on what the President hopes to come from the next round of talks with Iran?你能告訴我們總統希望下一輪與伊朗的會談能取得什麼成果嗎？Sure. First, when it comes to Harvard, as I said, the President has been quite clear they must follow federal law.當然。首先，關於哈佛，正如我所說，總統已經非常明確地表示他們必須遵守聯邦法律。He also wants to see Harvard apologize, and Harvard should apologize for the egregious anti-Semitism that took place on their college campus against Jewish American students.他還希望看到哈佛道歉，哈佛應該爲在他們校園內發生的針對猶太裔美國學生的惡劣反猶太主義行爲道歉。There were reports from professors about discriminatory behavior against Jewish students.有教授報告稱存在針對猶太學生的歧視行爲。Of course, you had the former President of the university saying bullying and harassment depends on the context.當然，你們也聽到了該大學前校長說欺凌和騷擾取決於具體情況。You also had an encampment on Harvard Yard that we all saw play out before the cameras.你們還在哈佛園看到了一個營地，我們都在鏡頭前看到了這一切的發生。The university failed to impose formal discipline on any students for this anti-Semitic conduct,該大學未能對任何學生的這種反猶太行爲施加正式紀律處分，including the occupation of a campus building and the disruption of classes with bullhorns.包括佔領校園建築和用擴音器擾亂課堂。The President believes Harvard should apologize to its Jewish American students for allowing such egregious behavior.總統認爲哈佛應該爲其允許如此惡劣的行爲向其猶太裔美國學生道歉。As for the tax-exempt status, I would defer you to the IRS for any updates.至於免稅地位，我會建議你向國稅局瞭解最新情況。I do want to answer your question on Iran, of course.當然，我確實想回答你關於伊朗的問題。The maximum pressure campaign on Iran continues, but as you know, the President has made it clear對伊朗的最大壓力運動仍在繼續，但如你所知，總統已經明確表示，he wants to see dialogue and discussion with Iran while making his directive about Iran never being able to obtain a nuclear weapon quite clear.他希望與伊朗進行對話和討論，同時非常明確地指示伊朗永遠不能獲得核武器。And the President spoke to the Sultan of Oman today, who helped facilitate these talks. I have a readout for all of you.總統今天與幫助促成這些會談的阿曼蘇丹通了話。我爲你們準備了一份通話紀要。He held a call with the Sultan of Oman today, and he thanked him for hosting the first direct meeting between the United States and Iran他今天與阿曼蘇丹通了電話，感謝他主辦了美國和伊朗之間的首次直接會晤，and emphasized the need for Iran to end its nuclear program through negotiations.並強調伊朗需要通過談判結束其核計劃。The two leaders also discussed the United States’ ongoing operations against the Houthis兩國領導人還討論了美國正在進行的針對胡塞武裝的行動，and emphasized that the Houthis will pay a severe price until they end their attacks on maritime traffic in the Red Sea.並強調胡塞武裝將付出沉重代價，直到他們停止對紅海海上交通的襲擊。As you know, an additional negotiation between Steve Witkoff and Iran’s representative has been scheduled for Saturday.如你所知，史蒂夫·威特科夫與伊朗代表的另一場談判已安排在週六。And since these are ongoing negotiations, I have nothing more to add on that. Can I come on Iran? Sure.由於這些是正在進行的談判，我沒有更多要補充的了。我可以問關於伊朗的問題嗎？當然。Thank you, Caroline.謝謝你，卡羅琳。When you said that the President said that Iran will never have nuclear weapons,當你說總統說過伊朗永遠不會擁有核武器時，is the focus on dismantling the entire nuclear program or just restricting enriched uranium or the missile program?重點是拆除整個核計劃，還是僅僅限制濃縮鈾或導彈計劃？The President does not want to see Iran have a nuclear program. He does not want Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. He’s been very clear about this.總統不希望看到伊朗擁有核計劃。他不希望伊朗獲得核武器。他對此一直非常明確。Shelby. Shelby, you have a seat today. I know. Stole it. Glad to see it.謝爾比。謝爾比，你今天有座位了。我知道。偷來的。很高興看到。Two quick ones on TikTok. First, is the President expecting to extend the TikTok ban that’s now June 19th if China doesn’t come to the table in time?兩個關於 TikTok 的快問。首先，如果中國未能及時談判，總統是否期望延長目前定於 6 月 19 日到期的 TikTok 禁令？Well, June 19th is a long way away, obviously. I think it’s two months away. Two months is a long time.嗯，6 月 19 日顯然還有很長一段時間。我想還有兩個月。兩個月是很長的時間。And the Trump administration, as you have all seen, we work at Trump speed around here. We get a lot done. So definitely don’t want to get ahead.特朗普政府，正如你們都看到的，我們在這裏以特朗普速度工作。我們完成了很多事情。所以肯定不想操之過急。The Vice President continues to lead these negotiations and talks. The President is involved and they’re ongoing.副總統繼續領導這些談判和會談。總統也參與其中，並且談判正在進行中。And then the President previously said he’d consider reducing tariffs on China in order to get a TikTok deal done. Is that option still on the table?然後，總統先前表示他會考慮降低對中國的關稅以達成 TikTok 協議。這個選項還在考慮之中嗎？Look, the President has made his position on China quite clear, although I do have an additional statement that he just shared with me in the Oval Office.聽着，總統已經非常明確地表明瞭他對中國的立場，儘管我確實還有一份他剛剛在橢圓形辦公室與我分享的額外聲明。The ball is in China’s court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don’t have to make a deal with them.球現在在中國那邊。中國需要和我們達成協議。我們不必和他們達成協議。There’s no difference between China and any other country, except they are much larger.中國和其他任何國家沒有區別，只是他們更大。And China wants what we have, what every country wants, what we have, the American consumer. Or to put it another way, they need our money.中國想要我們擁有的東西，每個國家都想要我們擁有的東西，那就是美國消費者。或者換句話說，他們需要我們的錢。So the President, again, has made it quite clear that he’s open to a deal with China, but China needs to make a deal with the United States of America. Sure.所以，總統再次非常明確地表示，他對與中國達成協議持開放態度，但中國需要與美利堅合衆國達成協議。當然。On tariffs, yesterday in the Oval Office. Which outlet are you with? The Canadian Public Broadcaster. Oh, nice to see you. Thank you.關於關稅，昨天在橢圓形辦公室。你是哪個媒體的？加拿大公共廣播公司。哦，很高興見到你。謝謝。Yesterday in the Oval Office, President Trump suggested that there could be some help for automakers. I’m wondering what that looks like.昨天在橢圓形辦公室，特朗普總統暗示可能會對汽車製造商提供一些幫助。我想知道那會是什麼樣子。Is it tariff relief on the 25 percent tariffs that are in place right now or the new tariffs that are coming up in May on auto parts?是減免目前實施的 25% 關稅，還是減免即將在 5 月份對汽車零部件徵收的新關稅？And a second on Canada, if I may. Regarding President Trump’s tone when it comes to Canada-U.S. relations.如果可以的話，第二個問題關於加拿大。關於特朗普總統在加美關係上的語氣。Canadians have noticed it’s shifted a bit in the past few weeks.加拿大人注意到過去幾周他的語氣有所轉變。Ever since the election campaign started, he’s stopped talking about Canada becoming the 51st state, at least publicly. I’m wondering if that’s on purpose and why.自從競選活動開始以來，他至少在公開場合不再談論加拿大成爲第 51 個州。我想知道這是故意的嗎？爲什麼？I would reject the idea that the President’s position on Canada has shifted.我不同意總統對加拿大的立場已經改變的說法。Perhaps he just hasn’t been asked about Canada by questions from this group in the Oval Office, but they see him almost every day.也許只是橢圓形辦公室裏的這羣人沒有問他關於加拿大的問題，但他們幾乎每天都見到他。But the President still maintains his position on Canada.但總統仍然堅持他對加拿大的立場。The United States has been subsidizing Canada’s national defense, and he believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America.美國一直在補貼加拿大的國防開支，他相信加拿大人如果成爲美利堅合衆國的第 51 個州將大有裨益。As for autos and auto parts, I don’t have anything to read out for you there, but I think the point the President was making is flexibility,至於汽車和汽車零部件，我沒有什麼可以向你宣讀的，但我認爲總統想要表達的重點是靈活性，and he has flexibility when it comes to negotiations and talks.他在談判和會談方面具有靈活性。But ultimately, his goal in his fair trade deals that he is pursuing with many countries around the world is to put the American worker first.但最終，他在與世界許多國家尋求的公平貿易協議中的目標是將美國工人放在首位。And we had automakers and autoworkers here at the White House on Labor Day who believe in this President我們在勞動節邀請了汽車製造商和汽車工人來到白宮，他們相信這位總統and his negotiating ability to put them first and to bring those jobs back to the United States of America.以及他將他們放在首位並將這些工作帶回美利堅合衆國的談判能力。And the President’s been very clear about that in his conversations with the automakers as well. Diana, go ahead.總統在與汽車製造商的對話中也對此非常明確。戴安娜，請講。Thanks, Caroline. One on Ukraine and one on China.謝謝，卡羅琳。一個關於烏克蘭，一個關於中國。On Ukraine, this past weekend Zelenskyy offered an invitation to President Trump, extending an offer for him to visit Ukraine.關於烏克蘭，上週末澤連斯基向特朗普總統發出邀請，邀請他訪問烏克蘭。Just wondering if there’s any update on that. Has Trump seen that offer and what he’s thinking about?只是想知道是否有任何最新進展。特朗普看到那個邀請了嗎？他在想什麼？I don’t know. Actually, I haven’t talked to the President about that, or if he saw Zelenskyy’s offer, I’m sure he did.我不知道。實際上，我還沒有和總統談論過這件事，或者他是否看到了澤連斯基的邀請，我肯定他看到了。I haven’t spoken to him about it. I can ask him what he thinks.我還沒和他談過。我可以問問他怎麼想。I certainly don’t have any plans to share on a potential trip to Ukraine, though.不過，我當然沒有任何關於可能訪問烏克蘭的計劃可以分享。And then on China, this last week, Chinese officials were posting videos on social media sites depicting Trump, JD Vance, Elon Musk然後關於中國，上週，中國官員在社交媒體網站上發佈視頻，描繪特朗普、JD 萬斯、埃隆·馬斯克in AI-generated videos working in factories putting together Nike shoes and iPhones and products like that.在人工智能生成的視頻中，在工廠裏組裝耐克鞋、iPhone 和類似產品。Has the White House seen these videos? Do you guys have a response to that?白宮看到這些視頻了嗎？你們對此有何迴應？I have seen the videos. I’m not sure who made the videos or if we can verify the authenticity,我看到了這些視頻。我不確定是誰製作了這些視頻，也不確定我們是否能覈實其真實性，but whoever made it clearly does not see the potential of the American worker, the American workforce.但無論誰製作了它，顯然都沒有看到美國工人、美國勞動力的潛力。The President believes in the American people and he knows that we have the best, not only consumer base in the world, but also the best workforce in the world.總統相信美國人民，他知道我們擁有世界上最好的，不僅是消費者基礎，也是最好的勞動力。And that’s why he’s so focused on bringing investments home and shoring up our critical supply chains and bolstering our manufacturing here as well. Brett.這就是爲什麼他如此專注於將投資帶回國內，鞏固我們關鍵的供應鏈，並支持我們這裏的製造業。佈雷特。Thanks, Caroline. Would the President support a ban on members of Congress trading stocks?謝謝，卡羅琳。總統會支持禁止國會議員交易股票嗎？I’m certain that’s something the President would be interested in looking at and I can ask him if he would support such a bill. Sure. Yes.我確信這是總統會有興趣研究的事情，我可以問他是否會支持這樣的法案。當然。是的。I have a question about the President’s post from this morning on farmers. He asked farmers to be patient and just hold on.我有一個關於總統今天早上關於農民的帖子的疑問。他要求農民保持耐心，堅持住。But a lot of farmers that I’ve talked to in the last week or so have said, you know, they’re in the middle of spring planting season但我過去一週左右交談過的許多農民都說，你知道，他們正處於春耕季節，and that a trade war makes everything sort of up in the air. What would his message to them be?而貿易戰讓一切都懸而未決。他對他們有什麼信息要傳達？And also, is there anything specifically planned to provide relief like in President Trump’s last term? Yes.另外，是否有什麼具體的計劃來提供像特朗普總統上個任期那樣的救濟？是的。Well, relief is being considered. The Secretary of Agriculture, I know, has spoken to the President about that and, again, it’s being considered.嗯，正在考慮提供救濟。我知道農業部長已經和總統談過這件事，並且，再次強調，正在考慮中。And as for the President’s message to the farmers, he put it out himself. He could speak for himself much better than I can speak for him.至於總統給農民的信息，他自己已經發布了。他比我更能爲自己說話。And so I would just direct you to the statement he had telling the farmers again and reiterating his support for them and that he has their backs, which he certainly does.所以我只會引導你去看他再次告訴農民並重申他對他們的支持以及他支持他們的聲明，他確實是這樣做的。Kelly, in the back.凱利，在後面。Thanks, Caroline. Two questions.謝謝，卡羅琳。兩個問題。The first one, a Georgia man was just arrested over alleged threats to kill Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.第一個，一名佐治亞州男子剛剛因涉嫌威脅殺害國家情報總監圖爾西·加巴德而被捕。Reportedly, there is now increased security around the FBI Deputy Director.據報道，聯邦調查局副局長周圍現在的安保有所加強。Can you talk about the level of threats against various administration officials and then a second one on Biden?你能談談針對各級政府官員的威脅程度嗎？然後第二個問題關於拜登。I’m sorry to hear that. I had not seen that report.聽到這個消息我很難過。我沒有看到那份報告。It’s very unfortunate and obviously the White House, the President, and the entire administration condemn any threats of violence這非常不幸，顯然白宮、總統以及整個政府譴責任何針對against any administration officials or public officials on both sides of the aisle here in Washington, D.C.華盛頓特區兩黨任何政府官員或公職人員的暴力威脅。It shouldn’t be tolerated and we commend the local law enforcement agencies for arresting this individual.這是不能容忍的，我們讚揚當地執法機構逮捕了這個人。But former President Biden, he’s said to deliver his first major speech since leaving office tonight.但是前總統拜登，據說他今晚將發表離任以來的首次重要演講。He plans to talk about what I’m told will be Social Security under the current administration, closing of offices, longer wait times,他計劃談論我被告知的現任政府下的社會保障問題，辦公室關閉，等待時間更長，harder for seniors and people with disabilities to access their benefits. This is what Democrats have been saying today.老年人和殘疾人更難獲得他們的福利。這就是民主黨人今天一直在說的。I wanted to get the President’s response or if he plans to respond to this and get his comments on what Democrats are calling cuts to Social Security.我想了解總統的迴應，或者他是否計劃對此作出迴應，並聽取他對民主黨人所稱的削減社會保障的評論。My first reaction when seeing former President Biden was speaking tonight was I’m shocked that he is speaking at nighttime.當我看到前總統拜登今晚要講話時的第一反應是，我很震驚他竟然在晚上講話。I thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight.我以爲他的就寢時間比他今晚的演講早得多。I understand the topic of his speech will be Social Security.我瞭解到他演講的主題將是社會保障。Let me make it very clear ahead of former President Biden’s remarks.讓我在前總統拜登發表講話之前非常明確地說明。The President, this President, President Trump, is absolutely certain about protecting Social Security benefits總統，這位總統，特朗普總統，對於保護守法的、納稅的美國公民和老年人的社會保障福利是絕對確定的，for law-abiding, taxpaying American citizens and seniors who have paid into this program.他們已經向這個項目繳費。He will always protect that program. He campaigned on it. He protected it in his first term and he’s back again to continue protecting it.他將永遠保護那個項目。他以此爲競選綱領。他在第一個任期內保護了它，現在他又回來繼續保護它。On the topic of Social Security, I have some news before I let you all go.關於社會保障的話題，在讓大家離開之前我有一些消息。Later this afternoon, the President will be signing a Presidential Memorandum aimed at stopping illegal aliens and other ineligible people今天下午晚些時候，總統將簽署一份總統備忘錄，旨在阻止非法外國人和其他不符合資格的人from obtaining Social Security Act benefits.獲得社會保障法案的福利。The Memorandum will direct the administration to ensure ineligible aliens are not receiving funds from the Social Security Act programs.該備忘錄將指示政府確保不符合資格的外國人不會從社會保障法案項目中獲得資金。It will expand the Social Security Administration’s fraud prosecutor program to at least 50 U.S. Attorney’s Offices它將把社會保障局的欺詐檢察官項目擴大到至少 50 個美國檢察官辦公室，and establish a Medicare and Medicaid fraud prosecution program in 15 U.S. Attorney’s Offices.並在 15 個美國檢察官辦公室設立醫療保險和醫療補助欺詐起訴項目。The Memorandum will also require the Social Security Administration Inspector General to investigate earning reports for individuals aged 100 or older該備忘錄還將要求社會保障局監察長調查年齡在 100 歲或以上、社會保障記錄不匹配的個人的收入報告，with mismatched Social Security records to combat identity theft.以打擊身份盜竊。And the Memorandum will direct the Social Security Administration to consider whether to reinstate the use of civil monetary penalties該備忘錄還將指示社會保障局考慮是否恢復對參與社會保障欺詐的個人使用民事罰款，against individuals who engage in Social Security fraud, an effort that has been paused for several years.這項工作已經暫停了幾年。These taxpayer-funded benefits should be only for eligible taxpayers,這些由納稅人資助的福利應該只提供給符合資格的納稅人，and President Biden should think about what he did in his last term, which is allow tens of millions of illegal people into our country,而拜登總統應該想想他在上個任期做了什麼，那就是允許數千萬非法人口進入我們的國家，many of whom were fraudulently receiving these benefits.其中許多人都在欺詐性地領取這些福利。So you’ll hear from the President on that later, and we will see you later in the East Room.所以你們稍後會聽到總統關於此事的講話，我們稍後在東廳見。 【核心词汇 - B1_C2】 單詞 音標 詞性 釋義 等級 次數 Christian &#x2F;ˈkrɪstʃən&#x2F;

Good afternoon. How are we? Good. Good to see you all.大家好。下午好。大家都還好嗎？很好。很高興見到大家。 I want to start today by addressing the US Army soldiers.今天我想首先談談美國陸軍士兵的事情。 Who went missing while conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilized tactical vehicle in Lithuania in the early hours of March 25.他們於 3 月 25 日凌晨在立陶宛執行修理和拖曳一輛無法移動的戰術車輛任務時失蹤。 Tragically, three soldiers were found deceased in Lithuania yesterday. And it pains me to confirm that today, the fourth soldier was also found deceased.不幸的是，昨天在立陶宛發現了三名士兵的遺體。而我沉痛地確認，今天第四名士兵也被發現遇難。 The president, the secretary of defense, and the entire White House are praying for the victims’ friends and family during this unimaginable time.總統、國防部長以及整個白宮都在這個難以想象的時刻爲遇難者的朋友和家人祈禱。 This is another stark reminder of the selfless sacrifice of our brave military men and women who risk their lives around the world every day to keep us safe.這再次嚴酷地提醒我們，我們勇敢的男女軍人每天在世界各地冒着生命危險保護我們的安全，做出了無私的犧牲。 God bless them. On another note, at our southern border, there is more massive news.上帝保佑他們。另外，關於我們的南部邊境，有更重大的消息。 Southwest border crossings in March fell to the lowest level in American history.三月份西南邊境的過境人數降至美國曆史最低水平。 Down 94% from March of last year under President Biden, when 137,000 illegal aliens poured across our wide-open southern border.與去年拜登總統任期內三月份相比下降了 94%，當時有 137,000 名非法移民涌入我們大開的南部邊境。 Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, Border Patrol agents are now back to doing the jobs they signed up for, securing the border.得益於特朗普總統的領導，邊境巡邏人員現在重新開始從事他們簽約時的工作——保衛邊境。 Rather than serving as travel agents for illegal aliens. The Los Angeles Times captured the Trump effect on the border with a recent article.而不是充當非法移民的旅行社代理。《洛杉磯時報》最近的一篇文章捕捉到了特朗普對邊境的影響。 Their headline read, “California-Mexico border, once overwhelmed, is now nearly empty.”他們的標題寫道：“曾不堪重負的加州-墨西哥邊境，如今幾乎空無一人。” With so few migrants coming into the US, they wrote, “Shelters that once served migrants have completely closed.”他們寫道，由於進入美國的移民如此之少，“曾經服務於移民的收容所已經完全關閉。” Deportations of illegal aliens who threaten the safety of the American people are also continuing at a rapid pace.威脅美國人民安全的非法移民的驅逐行動也在迅速進行中。 Over the weekend, the United States military transferred a group of 17 violent criminals from the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 terrorist organizations to El Salvador.上週末，美國軍方將來自“特倫德阿拉瓜”和 MS-13 恐怖組織的 17 名暴力罪犯移交給了薩爾瓦多。 And an illegal alien who was released by the Biden administration into our country was just arrested in Georgia.一名被拜登政府釋放到我們國家的非法移民剛剛在佐治亞州被捕。 And charged with the horrific killing of Camelia Williams, a mother of five and grandmother.他被控可怕地殺害了卡米莉亞·威廉姆斯，她是一位五個孩子的母親和祖母。 The suspect has now been indicted on charges of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, rape, aggravated sexual battery, and necrophilia.該嫌疑人現已被起訴，罪名包括惡意謀殺、重罪謀殺、嚴重攻擊、強姦、嚴重性侵犯和戀屍癖。 Which for those who don’t know, necrophilia is a sexual obsession with a corpse.對於那些不知道的人來說，戀屍癖是對屍體的性迷戀。 This suspect was ordered to be removed in July 2023, but the Biden administration allowed him to stay.該嫌疑人於 2023 年 7 月被下令驅逐，但拜登政府允許他留下。 This case represents the ruthless murderers, rapists.這個案件代表了那些無情的殺人犯、強姦犯。 And pedophiles who Joe Biden and Democrats let into our country over the past four years through our southern border.以及喬·拜登和民主黨人在過去四年裏通過我們的南部邊境放進我們國家的戀童癖者。 They should have never been here in the first place. Keep this in mind the next time you see Democrats protesting future illegal alien removals from our country.他們一開始就不應該在這裏。下次你看到民主黨人抗議未來將非法移民從我們國家驅逐出去時，請記住這一點。 President Trump is focused on fulfilling his greatest obligation to keep the American people safe and to defend our country from violent invaders.特朗普總統專注於履行他最大的義務，即保護美國人民的安全，保衛我們的國家免受暴力入侵者的侵害。 Looking ahead to tomorrow, April 2nd, 2025, will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history.展望明天，2025 年 4 月 2 日，將作爲現代美國曆史上最重要的日子之一載入史冊。 Our country has been one of the most open economies in the world, and we have the consumer base hands down, the best consumer base.我們的國家一直是世界上最開放的經濟體之一，而且我們擁有無可爭議的最佳消費羣體。 But too many foreign countries have their markets closed to our exports. This is fundamentally unfair.但太多外國的市場對我們的出口關閉。這根本上是不公平的。 The lack of reciprocity contributes to our large and persistent annual trade deficit that’s gutted our industries and hollowed out key workforces.缺乏互惠導致了我們巨大且持續的年度貿易逆差，這掏空了我們的產業，並導致關鍵勞動力流失。 But those days of America, beginning tomorrow, being ripped off are over.但是，從明天開始，美國被敲竹槓的日子結束了。 American workers and businesses will be put first under President Trump, just as he promised on the campaign trail.在特朗普總統的領導下，美國工人和企業將得到優先考慮，正如他在競選期間所承諾的那樣。 The president’s historic action tomorrow will improve American competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our massive trade deficits.總統明天採取的歷史性行動將提高美國在各個工業領域的競爭力，減少我們巨大的貿易逆差。 And ultimately protect our economic and national security. President Trump’s economic vision is rooted in common sense.並最終保護我們的經濟和國家安全。特朗普總統的經濟願景植根於常識。 America will offer companies the lowest taxes, energy costs, regulations.美國將爲公司提供最低的稅收、能源成本和法規。 If they make their products right here in the United States and hire American workers for the job.前提是他們在美國本土生產產品並僱用美國工人。 It’s simple. If you make your product in America, you will pay no tariffs.這很簡單。如果你在美國生產產品，你將無需支付任何關稅。 We have already seen a number of the largest companies in the world respond to this economic approach.我們已經看到世界上一些最大的公司對這種經濟策略做出了迴應。 For example, Project Stargate, led by Japan-based SoftBank and US-based OpenAI, and Oracle.例如，由日本軟銀和美國 OpenAI 及甲骨文領導的“星際之門”項目。 Announced a $500 billion private investment in the United States-based artificial intelligence infrastructure.宣佈在美國本土的人工智能基礎設施上投資 5000 億美元。 Apple announced a $500 billion investment in US manufacturing in training.蘋果公司宣佈在美國製造業和培訓方面投資 5000 億美元。 Nvidia announced it will invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next four years in US-based manufacturing.英偉達宣佈未來四年將在美國本土製造業投資數千億美元。 And the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company, TSMC, announced a $100 billion investment in US-based chips in manufacturing.臺灣半導體制造公司（臺積電）宣佈在美國本土芯片製造領域投資 1000 億美元。 These are just a few of the investment announcements that have already been made.這些只是已經宣佈的投資中的一小部分。 And it is clear that President Trump’s America First approach has already working.很明顯，特朗普總統的“美國優先”方針已經奏效。 In our new media seat today is Mark Halprith, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Two-Way.今天在我們新媒體席位上的是“Two-Way”的聯合創始人兼主編馬克·哈爾普林。 A new live video platform that builds communities around interactive conversations with leaders and content creators from every subject area.這是一個新的直播視頻平臺，通過與各領域領導者和內容創作者的互動對話來建立社羣。 Mark and his colleagues welcome all voices into discussions that are spirited but respectful.馬克和他的同事歡迎所有聲音參與到熱烈而相互尊重的討論中。 They have over 37.5 million video views, over 3.6 million watch time hours since the platform began just last year.自去年平臺啓動以來，他們已擁有超過 3750 萬的視頻觀看次數和超過 360 萬小時的觀看時長。 This is new media in its truest sense, allowing the people to ask questions, make comments.這是真正意義上的新媒體，允許人們提問、發表評論。 And be an active part of engagement on the most important issues facing the country and our world.並積極參與到關於國家和世界面臨的最重要問題的互動中來。 With that, Mark, please kick us off, and welcome to the briefing room. Thank you, Caroline. Appreciate it.那麼，馬克，請你開始提問吧，歡迎來到簡報室。謝謝你，卡羅琳。非常感謝。 I would ask you a question about tariffs and then one from one of the members of our community about education.我想問你一個關於關稅的問題，然後是一個來自我們社羣成員關於教育的問題。 It’s perceived by some that companies or countries, if they change their policies either before tomorrow or after tomorrow.有些人認爲，如果公司或國家在明天之前或之後改變政策。 Can have the president alter what he’s planning for that country or that sector. Is that a possibility?總統可能會改變他對該國或該行業的計劃。這有可能嗎？ And if so, what factors the president consider in making those changes?如果可能，總統在做出這些改變時會考慮哪些因素？ Well, the ultimate change for these companies in these countries, Mark, will happen when they decide to do business in the United States of America.嗯，馬克，對於這些國家的這些公司來說，最終的改變將發生在他們決定在美國做生意的時候。 And as I just laid out, they will face no tariffs at all if these companies choose to invest here in the United States.正如我剛纔闡述的，如果這些公司選擇在美國投資，它們將完全不會面臨任何關稅。 And to move their production and their manufacturing here to the United States as well.並將他們的生產和製造也轉移到美國。 As for tomorrow, the president will be addressing the decades of unfair trade practices that have ripped our country off and American workers off.至於明天，總統將處理幾十年來敲詐我們國家和美國工人的不公平貿易行爲。 It has hollowed out our middle class. It has destroyed our heartland.它掏空了我們的中產階級。它摧毀了我們的腹地。 And the president is focused on reshifting our global economy to ensure that America is once again the manufacturing superpower of the world.總統正致力於調整我們的全球經濟，以確保美國再次成爲世界製造業超級大國。 So if they do something today or later in the week that’s a pledge for future activity, would that be good enough potentially to alter the policy?那麼，如果他們今天或本週晚些時候做出未來行動的承諾，這是否可能足以改變政策？ Again, the president has been looking at the very unfair trade practices of the past.再說一次，總統一直在審視過去非常不公平的貿易行爲。 Certainly, the president is always up to take a phone call, always up for a good negotiation.當然，總統總是願意接電話，總是樂於進行好的談判。 But he is very much focused on fixing the wrongs of the past and showing that American workers have a fair shake.但他非常專注於糾正過去的錯誤，並確保美國工人獲得公平的機會。 So if someone calls after tomorrow and says, hey, I’m ready to make a change, he’d be open to that?那麼，如果有人在明天之後打電話說，嘿，我準備做出改變，他會對此持開放態度嗎？ The president is always open to taking calls. OK. A question from one of our community members, Katie Reeds, is a school teacher in Wisconsin.總統總是願意接聽電話。好的。一個來自我們社羣成員凱蒂·里茲的問題，她是威斯康星州的一名學校教師。 She’s taught K-3 in public, independent private, and private schools. And here’s what she wanted me to ask you.她曾在公立、獨立私立和私立學校教授 K-3 年級。她想讓我問你的是這個。 She says, I see the elimination of the Department of Education as an excellent first step in the improvement of our school system.她說，“我認爲取消教育部是改善我們學校系統的絕佳第一步。” Do you see any further role the federal government can take beyond this.您認爲聯邦政府在此之外還能扮演什麼進一步的角色嗎？ Possibly in promoting the expansion of voucher programs or reducing the influence that teachers’ unions hold over our schools?比如可能在推動教育券計劃的擴展或減少教師工會對我們學校的影響力方面？ Well, first of all, I want to thank Katie for her service to our country and our nation’s children.嗯，首先，我要感謝凱蒂爲我們國家和我們國家的孩子們所做的服務。 Being a teacher is the most noble profession that we believe one can have.我們認爲，教師是人們可以擁有的最高尚的職業。 And the president said in his remarks when he signed the executive order to dismantle the Department of Education that he loves our teachers.總統在簽署解散教育部的行政命令時曾表示，他熱愛我們的教師。 And in part, this order is to empower our teachers to have greater decision making in the classroom.在某種程度上，這項命令是爲了賦予我們的教師在課堂上擁有更大的決策權。 Nobody knows our nation’s children and our students better than our teachers who are with them every single day.沒有人比每天和孩子們在一起的老師更瞭解我們國家的孩子和學生。 As for the federal government’s role to get to the heart of Katie’s question, the president has made it clear to Lyndon McMahon.至於聯邦政府的角色，回到凱蒂問題的核心，總統已經向林登·麥克馬洪明確表示。 That we need to find other places within our federal government for critical programs regarding education.我們需要在聯邦政府內部爲關鍵的教育相關項目尋找其他安置之處。 Pell grants, Title IX, lawsuits, et cetera, civil rights lawsuits.佩爾助學金、教育法修正案第九條、訴訟等等，公民權利訴訟。 All of that are critical functions, special needs programs, nutrition programs.所有這些都是關鍵功能，特殊需求項目、營養項目。 But there are other places throughout the federal bureaucracy where those things can happen in work.但在整個聯邦官僚機構中，還有其他地方可以完成這些工作。 The Department of Education has been a very bloated bureaucracy. We spent trillions of dollars on this department. And for what?教育部一直是一個非常臃腫的官僚機構。我們在這個部門上花費了數萬億美元。結果呢？ Our children are worse off as far as education goes today than they were when this department originated. And that’s very concerning to the president.就教育而言，我們的孩子今天的情況比這個部門成立時還要糟糕。這讓總統非常擔憂。 On two issues she cited are those of priorities for the president, school education choice vouchers and diminishing the role of teachers.關於她提到的兩個問題——學校教育選擇券和削弱教師（工會）的作用，這些是總統的優先事項嗎？ The president is very supportive of both of those things, particularly when it comes to school choice.總統非常支持這兩件事，特別是在學校選擇方面。 He has said that school choice is the civil rights issue of our time. And he wants every child, regardless of zip code, socioeconomic status.他曾說過，學校選擇是我們這個時代的民權問題。他希望每個孩子，無論其郵政編碼、社會經濟地位如何。 How much money their parents have, to be able to go to the school of their choosing that best suits their educational needs.無論其父母有多少錢，都能去選擇最適合他們教育需求的學校。 And he is going to empower state and local leaders to make those decisions on behalf of our nation’s children. Thanks for being here, Mark.他將授權州和地方領導人代表我們國家的孩子們做出這些決定。感謝你的到來，馬克。 Jeff. Just changing subjects for one second.傑夫。稍微換個話題。 The administration has expressed a complete confidence in how all the deportation flights to El Salvador were conducted.政府已表示對所有飛往薩爾瓦多的驅逐航班的執行方式完全有信心。 But now that the administration has conceded that there was an error of one Salvadorian national, will there be any reviews conducted?但既然政府承認在一名薩爾瓦多國民的問題上存在錯誤，是否會進行任何審查？ And does the president express any thoughts on the one error that was disclosed in court last night?總統對昨晚在法庭上披露的這一個錯誤有什麼看法嗎？ Well, first of all, the error that you are referring to was a clerical error. It was an administrative error.嗯，首先，你提到的錯誤是一個文書錯誤。這是一個行政錯誤。 The administration maintains the position that this individual who was deported to El Salvador.政府堅持認爲，這名被驅逐到薩爾瓦多的個人。 And will not be returning to our country was a member of the brutal and vicious MS-13 gang. That is fact number one.並且不會返回我們國家，是殘暴兇狠的 MS-13 黑幫成員。這是事實一。 Fact number two, we also have credible intelligence proving that this individual was involved in human trafficking.事實二，我們也有可靠的情報證明此人蔘與了人口販賣。 And fact number three, this individual was a member, actually a leader, of the brutal MS-13 gang.事實三，此人是殘暴的 MS-13 黑幫的成員，實際上是一名頭目。 Which this president has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.本屆總統已將該組織指定爲外國恐怖組織。 Fact number four is that foreign terrorists do not have legal protections in the United States of America anymore.事實四是，外國恐怖分子在美國不再享有法律保護。 And it is within the president’s executive authority and power to deport these heinous individuals from American communities.將這些令人髮指的個人從美國社區驅逐出去，屬於總統的行政權力和權限範圍。 It is a promise he campaigned on. It is a promise he is keeping. And every single person in this room should be grateful for that.這是他在競選時做出的承諾。這是他正在履行的承諾。這個房間裏的每一個人都應該對此心存感激。 Considering especially MS-13 is very prevalent and prominent here in the District of Columbia, in Maryland and in Virginia,特別是考慮到 MS-13 在哥倫比亞特區、馬里蘭州和弗吉尼亞州非常猖獗和突出， And the president, the attorney general.總統、司法部長。 Everyone who has been involved in these operations is focused on eradicating these criminals and terrorists from our communities.所有參與這些行動的人都致力於從我們的社區中清除這些罪犯和恐怖分子。 The vice president said he was a convicted member of MS-13. What evidence is there to back that up? There’s a lot of evidence.副總統說他是 MS-13 的定罪成員。有什麼證據支持這一點？有很多證據。 In the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have that evidence, and I saw it this morning. Steve.國土安全部和移民與海關執法局（ICE）掌握着這些證據，我今天早上看到了。史蒂夫。 Has the president fully made up his mind on the level of tariffs to impose tomorrow? We keep hearing about a 20% flat rate.總統是否已完全決定明天要徵收的關稅水平？我們一直聽說會是 20% 的統一稅率。 The president said last night he has made a decision and a determination.總統昨晚表示他已經做出了決定和決斷。 I was with him in the Oval Office earlier, and he is going to announce that decision tomorrow. I don’t want to get ahead of the president.我早些時候在橢圓形辦公室和他在一起，他將在明天宣佈這個決定。我不想搶在總統前面宣佈。 This is obviously a very big day.這顯然是非常重要的一天。 He is with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker.他現在正和他的貿易和關稅團隊在一起，完善方案，以確保這對美國人民和美國工人來說是一個完美的協議。 And you will all find out in about 24 hours from now. And are the car tariffs going to go into effect on April 3rd as scheduled?大約 24 小時後你們都會知道。汽車關稅會按計劃在 4 月 3 日生效嗎？ Correct. Yes, they will. Okay. And last thing, would you like to respond to the Chinese military drills around Taiwan? Yes, I would.是的。它們會的。好的。最後一件事，您想回應中國在臺灣周邊的軍事演習嗎？是的，我想回應。 As a matter of fact, the National Security Council briefed me on this this morning.事實上，國家安全委員會今天早上向我簡報了此事。 And they said that the president is emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait.他們說總統正在強調維護臺灣海峽和平的重要性。 Encouraging the peaceful resolution of these cross-strait issues.鼓勵和平解決這些兩岸問題。 Reiterating our opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.重申我們反對任何以武力或脅迫方式單方面改變現狀的企圖。 That is directly from the national security advisor. Just for you, Steve Holland of Reuters.這是直接來自國家安全顧問的話。專門說給你聽的，路透社的史蒂夫·霍蘭德。 Monica. Thank you so much, Caroline.莫妮卡。非常感謝，卡羅琳。 Elon Musk this week revealed that Doge found that the Biden administration issued over 2 million Social Security numbers to illegal aliens.埃隆·馬斯克本週透露，Doge 發現拜登政府向非法移民發放了超過 200 萬個社會保障號碼。 Found 20 million dead people marked as a lot in the Social Security system.發現社會保障系統中有 2000 萬已故人士被標記爲在世。（注：原文爲 marked as a lot，可能指標記爲“大量存在”或活着，此處按後者理解） Has the White House confirmed these numbers with Elon, and is the White House looking into correcting this?白宮是否與埃隆確認了這些數字？白宮是否正在調查並糾正這個問題？ I’m not sure about those specific numbers that Mr. Musk cited. I can tell you what the Social Security administration has said themselves.我不確定馬斯克先生引用的那些具體數字。我可以告訴你社會保障局自己是怎麼說的。 According to an inspector general’s report that was conducted last year showing there was nearly $80 billion worth of fraud in this program.根據去年進行的一份監察長報告顯示，該計劃中存在近 800 億美元的欺詐。 We know for a fact there are individuals who should not be receiving benefits on the Social Security roles.我們確切知道，社會保障名單上有一些不應領取福利的個人。 And this administration is focused on cleaning out the waste, fraud, and abuse in every agency, but particularly in Social Security.本屆政府專注於清理每個機構的浪費、欺詐和濫用，尤其是在社會保障方面。 To make it stronger for our tax-paying, law-abiding citizens who deserve these entitlements and programs.爲了讓那些應得這些福利和計劃的納稅守法公民的社保體系更加穩固。 Because you did bring up Doge, I do want to tout the incredible efforts that have been made at the Environmental Protection Agency.因爲你提到了 Doge（可能是指調查或某個人&#x2F;組織），我確實想宣傳一下環境保護局（EPA）所做的令人難以置信的努力。 Administrator Lee Zeldin is just doing a tremendous job. Just yesterday and today, it will be going into effect.局長李·澤爾丁的工作做得非常出色。就在昨天和今天，它將開始生效。 He announced that taxpayers will be saved $8 million in annual lease costs by moving staff out of the 323,000 square feet of space.他宣佈，通過將員工遷出目前環保局佔用的 323,000 平方英尺完全不必要的空間，每年將爲納稅人節省 800 萬美元的租賃成本。 That the EPA currently occupies, which is completely unnecessary. Yesterday, Administrator Zeldin also announced he will be shutting down a museum.環保局目前佔用的空間是完全不必要的。昨天，澤爾丁局長還宣佈他將關閉一個博物館。 That the Biden administration built to tell a selective story about the EPA’s history and climate change.該博物館是拜登政府建造的，用來講述一個經過挑選的關於環保局歷史和氣候變化的故事。 It was a real pat on the back to President Biden. And guess how much American taxpayers paid for it?這對拜登總統來說真是一種自我吹捧。猜猜美國納稅人爲它付了多少錢？ $4 million for this museum that I think only 1,000 visitors saw last year alone, and it would cost American taxpayers $600,000 per year to operate this museum.這個博物館耗資 400 萬美元，據我所知去年一年只有 1000 名遊客參觀，而且每年運營這個博物館要花費美國納稅人 60 萬美元。 Well, it’s not going to exist anymore. We’re going to save taxpayers those critical funds, and Administrator Zeldin is very proud to announce that.嗯，它將不復存在了。我們將爲納稅人節省下這些關鍵資金，澤爾丁局長非常自豪地宣佈了這一點。 And just at EPA alone and the cuts that they have made, they’ve saved taxpayers more than $22 billion in wasteful grants and spending.僅在環保局，通過他們所做的削減，就爲納稅人節省了超過 220 億美元的浪費性撥款和開支。 Peter. Thank you, Caroline. When the President goes down to Florida on the weekends, does he ever hear from, there are so many retired folks down in Florida.彼得。謝謝你，卡羅琳。當總統週末去佛羅里達時，他是否曾聽取過，佛羅里達有很多退休人士。 Does he ever hear from any retired Americans who are stressed about these wild swings in the stock market because of the tariff uncertainty.他是否曾聽取過那些因關稅不確定性而對股市劇烈波動感到壓力的退休美國人的意見？ And they’re sitting there on fixed income or living off of 401(k) and they don’t know how much money is going to be left?他們靠固定收入或 401(k) 退休金生活，不知道還剩下多少錢？ Well, certainly, they are legitimate concerns, and the President takes those concerns very seriously, and he’s addressing them every single day.嗯，當然，這些是合理的擔憂，總統非常重視這些擔憂，並且他每天都在處理這些問題。 And tomorrow’s announcement is to protect future generations. The senior citizens you mentioned.明天的宣佈是爲了保護子孫後代。你提到的老年人。 It’s for their kids and their grandkids to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream.這是爲了他們的孩子和孫子，確保在美國有工作機會，讓他們的孩子能夠實現美國夢。 Just like they presumably did. And as for their worries about their 401(k)s, their Social Security, I just addressed Social Security.就像他們（老年人）大概曾經做到的那樣。至於他們對 401(k) 和社會保障的擔憂，我剛剛談到了社會保障。 This President is always going to protect it for our tax-paying senior citizens.這位總統將始終爲我們納稅的老年公民保護它。 As for their 401(k)s, look at what President Trump did for you in his first term.至於他們的 401(k)，看看特朗普總統在他的第一個任期內爲你們做了什麼。 He is working on implementing that economic formula every single day by lowering inflation, lowering energy prices, massive deregulatory efforts.他每天都在努力實施那個經濟方案，通過降低通貨膨脹、降低能源價格、大規模放松管制。 While simultaneously effectively implementing tariffs, and they’ll hear more about that announcement tomorrow.同時有效地實施關稅，他們明天會聽到更多關於這個宣佈的消息。 And you said that the President, right now, is with the trade and tariff team. They are very confident that this is all going to work.你說總統現在正和貿易和關稅團隊在一起。他們非常有信心這一切都會奏效。 Yes. But what if they’re wrong? They’re not going to be wrong. It is going to work.是的。但如果他們錯了怎麼辦？他們不會錯的。它會奏效的。 The President has a brilliant team of advisors who have been studying these issues for decades.總統擁有一支出色的顧問團隊，他們研究這些問題已有數十年。 And we are focused on restoring the golden age of America and making America a manufacturing superpower.我們專注於恢復美國的黃金時代，讓美國成爲製造業超級大國。 And again, Peter, I would point you to the investments that have already trickled into this country.再說一次，彼得，我會讓你看看那些已經涌入這個國家的投資。 And the President hasn’t even made his tariff announcement yet tomorrow.而總統甚至還沒有在明天宣佈他的關稅計劃。 There have been billions of dollars in private investments from around the world pouring into American communities.已經有來自世界各地的數十億美元私人投資涌入美國社區。 What does that look like for those watching at home, for the people you mentioned, worried about their own economic circumstances?對於那些在家觀看的人，對於你提到的那些擔心自己經濟狀況的人來說，這意味着什麼？ It means more jobs in your communities, which means more money, more investments, more money in your pocket.這意味着你們社區有更多的工作崗位，意味着更多的錢，更多的投資，你口袋裏有更多的錢。 That’s what the President is committed to.這就是總統所致力於的。 And I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the President’s commitment to tax cuts, which we are counting on Congress to do, especially on Social Security.如果我不提及總統對減稅的承諾，那將是我的疏忽，我們指望國會這樣做，特別是在社會保障方面。 And one more. Sure. Are the special elections today a referendum on the President?還有一個問題。當然。今天的特別選舉是對總統的全民公投嗎？ I think the, first of all, as you know, I’m a government employee now, so I’m not very much allowed to comment on elections that are taking place.我認爲，首先，如你所知，我現在是政府僱員，所以我不太被允許評論正在進行的選舉。 That’s something to get used to, having just been on the campaign trail for quite some time.剛在競選活動中待了相當長一段時間，這是需要適應的事情。 But the President is the leader of the America First movement and the MAGA movement.但總統是“美國優先”運動和“讓美國再次偉大”（MAGA）運動的領導者。 And that was made very clear on November the 5th, when he received nearly 80 million votes.這一點在 11 月 5 日已經非常清楚了，當時他獲得了近 8000 萬張選票。 I could also say that it is the constitutional right of every law-abiding American in these places where these elections are being held to vote.我還可以說，在這些舉行選舉的地方，投票是每個守法美國人的憲法權利。 And every American should exercise their constitutional rights. Sure. Thanks, Carolyn. A few questions about this deportation case.每個美國人都應該行使他們的憲法權利。當然。謝謝，卡羅琳。關於這個驅逐案有幾個問題。 First, I wanted to clarify something that you said to Jeff a few minutes ago. You said you’d seen evidence that this man was a convicted gang member.首先，我想澄清你幾分鐘前對傑夫說的一些話。你說你看到了證據表明這個人是被定罪的幫派成員。 In what court was he convicted and for what? This individual was an MS-13 ringleader. This individual was also engaged in human trafficking.他在哪個法庭被定罪？罪名是什麼？這個人是 MS-13 的頭目。這個人也參與了人口販賣。 And I’m glad you brought up this point again, because I would like to point out that if you just saw the headline from the insane.我很高興你再次提出這一點，因爲我想指出，如果你只看到那個瘋狂的、 Failing Atlantic magazine this morning, you would think this individual was Father of the Year, living in Maryland, living a peaceful life.失敗的《大西洋月刊》今天早上的標題，你會認爲這個人是年度模範父親，住在馬里蘭州，過着平靜的生活。 When that couldn’t be further from the truth. They didn’t even mention in the title of that article.而這與事實相去甚遠。他們甚至在那篇文章的標題中都沒有提到。 Or even in the first paragraph, that this individual is an illegal criminal who broke our nation’s immigration laws.甚至在第一段中也沒有提到，這個人是一個違反了我們國家移民法的非法罪犯。 He is a leader in the brutal MS-13 gang, and he is involved in human trafficking. And now MS-13 is a designated foreign terrorist organization.他是殘暴的 MS-13 黑幫的頭目，並且參與了人口販賣。現在 MS-13 是一個指定的外國恐怖組織。 Foreign terrorists have no legal protections in the United States of America.外國恐怖分子在美國沒有法律保護。 And this administration is going to continue to deport foreign terrorists and illegal criminals from our nation’s interior.本屆政府將繼續從我們國家內部驅逐外國恐怖分子和非法罪犯。 But a judge ordered that he should remain in this country. So are you saying that it is okay to ignore a judge’s ruling if you don’t like it?但是一位法官命令他應該留在這個國家。所以你的意思是，如果你不喜歡法官的裁決就可以無視它嗎？ Who does that judge work for? It was an immigration judge who works for the Department of Justice at the direction of the Attorney General of the United States.那位法官爲誰工作？那是一位移民法官，他在美國司法部長的指導下爲司法部工作。 Whose name is Pam Bondi, who has committed to eradicating MS-13 from our nation’s interior. And let me tell you why we’ve made this commitment.這位司法部長的名字是帕姆·邦迪，她致力於從我們國家內部根除 MS-13。讓我告訴你我們爲什麼做出這個承諾。 MS-13, may I remind each and every one of you, is a brutal and vicious gang. They raped and strangled a 20-year-old autistic woman to death in Maryland.MS-13，請允許我提醒你們每一個人，是一個殘暴兇狠的幫派。他們在馬里蘭州強姦並勒死了一名 20 歲的自閉症婦女。 They hacked four people to death with machetes in a park on Long Island.他們在長島的一個公園裏用砍刀砍死了四個人。 They have kidnapped, sexually tortured, and shot a teenage girl in Texas after she insulted them, allegedly.據稱，他們在德克薩斯州綁架、性虐待並槍殺了一名侮辱他們的少女。 Killed and mutilated a 17-year-old girl in Virginia, stabbing him 16 times and cutting off his hands.在弗吉尼亞州殺害並肢解了一名 17 歲女孩，刺了他 16 刀並砍掉了他的手。（注：原文此處性別用詞似乎有誤，應爲男孩或女孩其中之一） They beheaded and cut out the heart of a man in Washington, D.C. They raped and murdered a 13-year-old girl in California.他們在華盛頓特區將一名男子斬首並挖出心臟。他們在加利福尼亞州強姦並謀殺了一名 13 歲的女孩。 They sex trafficked a slew of young girls, including one who was just 12 years old.他們性販運了大量年輕女孩，其中包括一名年僅 12 歲的女孩。 Raped an 11-year-old girl in Brooklyn while her brother was in the room.在布魯克林強姦了一名 11 歲的女孩，當時她的兄弟就在房間裏。 Sex trafficked a 13-year-old in Maryland in Virginia, miles away from this White House, even beating her 26 times on her backside with a baseball bat.在距離白宮僅幾英里的馬里蘭州和弗吉尼亞州性販運了一名 13 歲的女孩，甚至用棒球棒打了她背部 26 次。 Pressured homeless New Yorkers to undergo unnecessary surgeries such as spinal fusion in order to bolster their fraudulent lawsuits.迫使紐約無家可歸者接受不必要的手術，如脊柱融合術，以支持他們的欺詐性訴訟。 These are vicious criminals. This is a vicious gang.這些是兇惡的罪犯。這是一個兇惡的幫派。 And I wish that the media would spend just a second of the same time you have spent trying to litigate each and every individual of this gang.我希望媒體能花哪怕一秒鐘的時間，就像你們花時間試圖爲這個幫派的每一個成員辯護一樣， Who has been deported from our country as the innocent Americans whose lives have been lost at the hands of these brutal criminals.去關注那些因這些殘暴罪犯而喪生的無辜美國人，而這些罪犯已被驅逐出境。 We maintain our position and very strongly so. Jennifer. One more on the tariffs. Can you say what the latest thinking is on the start date?我們堅持我們的立場，並且非常堅定。詹妮弗。再問一個關於關稅的問題。你能說說關於生效日期的最新想法嗎？ I know you were just in the Oval. Are they all going to take effect this week on the reciprocal tariffs?我知道你剛在橢圓形辦公室。關於互惠關稅，它們都會在本週生效嗎？ And whenever they start, is that enough time for companies and everyone involved to adjust to that start date?無論何時開始，這是否足夠讓公司和所有相關方適應那個生效日期？ My understanding is that the tariff announcement will come tomorrow. They will be effective immediately.我的理解是關稅公告將在明天發佈。它們將立即生效。 And the President has been teasing this for quite some time, as you know. He’s talked a lot about April 2nd as Liberation Day in America.如你所知，總統已經預告這件事有一段時間了。他多次提到 4 月 2 日是美國的解放日。 It would be taking place today, if not for April Fool’s Day. But tomorrow will be the day, and he’s been talking about it for a while.如果不是因爲愚人節，它本該在今天發生。但明天就是那一天，他已經談論了一段時間了。 And as a result, you’ve seen these companies make commitments to investing right here in the United States.結果是，你已經看到這些公司承諾在美國本土投資。 Jasmine. Thank you so much.賈斯敏。非常感謝。 I wonder, back on tariffs, what, if any, market indicators is the White House looking for to see if this tariff’s plan is successful down the line?我想知道，回到關稅問題上，白宮正在關注哪些市場指標（如果有的話）來判斷這個關稅計劃未來是否成功？ Well, look, the President has been asked and answered this question about the stock market and whether he’s watching it.嗯，看，總統已經被問到並回答了關於股市以及他是否關注股市的問題。 And I’ve said and he has said, the market is a snapshot in time.我和他都說過，市場只是某個時間點的快照。 Yesterday, Dow futures were up, and there’s been a lot of talk about the market, and it was up yesterday.昨天，道瓊斯指數期貨上漲了，關於市場的討論很多，昨天市場是上漲的。 So, look, the President wants to ensure that all Americans make out well, particularly Main Street.所以，看，總統希望確保所有美國人都能過得好，特別是普通民衆（Main Street）。 That’s the focus of these tariffs. But as I’ve said repeatedly, just like they did in, just like they were in his first term, Wall Street will be just fine.這就是這些關稅的重點。但正如我反覆說過的，就像在他的第一個任期內一樣，華爾街會沒事的。 Shelby. Thanks. A bipartisan pair of senators sent a letter to the President today.謝爾比。謝謝。今天，兩位跨黨派參議員致信總統。 Arguing that the recent strikes in Yemen are emboldening the Houthis and saying that Congress has not authorized war against them.信中認爲最近在也門的打擊行動正在助長鬍塞武裝的氣焰，並指出國會尚未授權對他們開戰。 Is the administration planning to consult with Congress at some point or going forward regarding the strikes and any response on the letter?政府是否計劃在某個時候或未來就這些打擊行動以及對信件的任何迴應與國會進行磋商？ Well, I would absolutely reject Congress’s claims. Who made those claims in Congress? Senator Jeff Merkley and Rand Paul.嗯，我絕對會駁斥國會的說法。國會中是誰提出的這些主張？參議員傑夫·默克利和蘭德·保羅。 Okay. Well, I would absolutely reject those claims. These Houthi strikes have been incredibly successful.好的。嗯，我絕對會駁斥那些說法。這些針對胡塞武裝的打擊非常成功。 Last time I was at this podium, there were more than 100 successful strikes. There have now been over 200 successful strikes against the Houthis.上次我站在這裏時，已經有超過 100 次成功的打擊。現在已經對胡塞武裝進行了超過 200 次成功的打擊。 Iran is incredibly weakened as a result of these attacks, and we have seen they’ve taken out Houthi leaders.伊朗因這些襲擊而被極大地削弱了，我們看到他們已經除掉了胡塞武裝的領導人。 They’ve taken out critical members who were launching strikes on naval ships and on commercial vessels.他們除掉了那些對海軍艦艇和商業船隻發動襲擊的關鍵成員。 And this operation will not stop until the freedom of navigation in this region is restored.這項行動將不會停止，直到該地區的航行自由得到恢復。 Which is a critical principle, and this President stands behind our Defense Department, who’s doing a tremendous job.這是一個關鍵原則，本屆總統支持我們做得非常出色的國防部。 And are they going to, is the White House going to confer with Congress going forward on this?他們是否會，白宮未來是否會就此事與國會協商？ I would have to ask our team here at the White House, but the President is well within his authority, as is the Secretary of Defense.我得問問我們在白宮的團隊，但總統完全有權這樣做，國防部長也是。 Again, these are defensive strikes. The Houthis have been launching attacks on U.S. naval vessels and commercial ships for quite some time.再次強調，這些是防禦性打擊。胡塞武裝對美國海軍艦艇和商船發動襲擊已經有相當長一段時間了。 Go ahead. Caroline, this is, the pause on the Canadian and Mexican tariffs, the Fentanyl tariffs, that’s set to expire tomorrow.請講。卡羅琳，這是關於暫停對加拿大和墨西哥徵收的關稅，即芬太尼關稅，該暫停措施定於明天到期。 Is the President considering extending that pause? Look, I will let the President speak on the specifics of the tariffs tomorrow.總統是否考慮延長暫停期？看，關於關稅的具體細節，我會讓總統明天來講。 But as for Fentanyl, we have seen this has certainly caused a national security crisis here in the United States.但就芬太尼而言，我們看到這確實在美國引發了一場國家安全危機。 Fentanyl continues to be the number-one killer of young people in this country, and the President is very much focused on that.芬太尼仍然是這個國家年輕人的頭號殺手，總統對此非常關注。 Deanna. Thank you, Caroline. The President really, absolutely signed an executive order on making D.C. safe and beautiful.迪安娜。謝謝你，卡羅琳。總統確實簽署了一項關於讓華盛頓特區安全和美麗的行政命令。 On the campaign trail, he talked about making New York great again. Does he have any plans on establishing a similar task force?在競選期間，他談到要讓紐約再次偉大。他是否有計劃成立類似的工作組？ Has he been pressuring Governor Hockel in any way in his conversations about New York and lowering crime?在他關於紐約和降低犯罪率的談話中，他是否以任何方式向霍赫爾州長施壓？ Well, he has been in correspondence with Governor Hockel quite a bit on the issue of crime, also on the issue of congestion pricing.嗯，他在犯罪問題上，以及在擁堵費問題上，與霍赫爾州長有過相當多的通信。 And so many other issues that are facing New Yorkers. He wants New York to clean up their streets, just as he does here in Washington, D.C.以及紐約人面臨的許多其他問題。他希望紐約清理他們的街道，就像他在華盛頓特區所做的那樣。 He also speaks to Mayor Adams, as well.他也和亞當斯市長交談。 So he’s engaged with state and local leaders across the entire country to ensure they’re doing their part to help American citizens in each and every state.所以他與全國各地的州和地方領導人接觸，確保他們儘自己的一份力量來幫助每個州的美國公民。 Regardless of if it’s a red state or a blue state. A question on Russia.無論那是紅州還是藍州。一個關於俄羅斯的問題。 Yesterday, the Russian government said that their new goal is 160,000 conscripts for the war.昨天，俄羅斯政府表示他們的新目標是爲戰爭徵召 16 萬名士兵。 Has the President seen that number, and does he have any response given his recent conversations on peace talks?總統是否看到了這個數字？鑑於他最近關於和平談判的對話，他是否有任何迴應？ Well, I can tell you what the President said last night, and that is he is frustrated with leaders on both sides of this war.嗯，我可以告訴你總統昨晚說了什麼，那就是他對這場戰爭雙方的領導人都感到沮喪。 He wants this war to end. There are men that are dying on both sides, and it’s been going on for far too long.他希望這場戰爭結束。雙方都有人在死去，而且戰爭持續太久了。 Our team continues to be engaged with the Russians as we are with the Ukrainians.我們的團隊繼續與俄羅斯人接觸，就像我們與烏克蘭人接觸一樣。 And the President continues to be very, very much engaged on this topic every single day. Caroline. Caroline. Caroline. Sure. Caroline. Sure.總統每天都持續非常、非常深入地參與這個話題。卡羅琳。卡羅琳。卡羅琳。當然。卡羅琳。當然。 The President said over the weekend that he couldn’t care less if prices went up on foreign cars because people buy more American cars.總統週末表示，他一點也不在乎外國汽車價格上漲，因爲人們會購買更多的美國汽車。 There’s been consensus from a lot of economists that these tariffs could raise prices on other goods as well.許多經濟學家已達成共識，認爲這些關稅也可能提高其他商品的價格。 Is the President comfortable with Americans on Main Street paying more because of these tariffs?總統是否對普通美國人因這些關稅而支付更多感到安心？ The President is doing everything he can, and this entire administration is doing everything we can to bring down the cost of living in this country.總統正在盡其所能，本屆政府也在盡一切努力降低這個國家的生活成本。 An inflation mess that was fueled by the previous administration’s reckless spending overburdened some regulations.這是一個由上屆政府魯莽支出和過度監管助長的通脹爛攤子。 That this administration is focused on slashing every single day. I just read you a statistic just from the Environmental Protection Agency alone.本屆政府正專注於每天削減這些（支出和監管）。我剛纔給你讀了一個僅來自環境保護局的統計數據。 We’re saving taxpayers money that’s ultimately gonna drive down inflation.我們正在爲納稅人省錢，這最終將降低通貨膨脹。 And we’re unleashing the might of our energy industry, which will bring down prices as well.我們正在釋放我們能源產業的力量，這也會降低價格。 To the heart of your question, because this is very important to the American people, you should trust what this President did for you in his first term.回到你問題的核心，因爲這對美國人民非常重要，你應該相信這位總統在他的第一個任期內爲你所做的事情。 He effectively utilized tariffs while driving down inflation. It was a record low, 1.4% when he left office, and he’s focused on getting back to that.他有效地利用了關稅，同時降低了通貨膨脹。他離任時通脹率是創紀錄的低點 1.4%，他正致力於回到那個水平。 It’s unfortunate the previous administration left us in this mess. Sure. Last question.不幸的是，上屆政府給我們留下了這個爛攤子。當然。最後一個問題。 Representative Annapallina Luna left the Freedom Caucus over there.衆議員安娜保利娜·盧納退出了那邊的自由核心小組。 Lacked support for her bill that would allow new parents to proxy vote around 12 weeks around the birth of their baby. Does the President support that bill?原因是她提出的允許新生兒父母在嬰兒出生前後約 12 周內進行代理投票的法案缺乏支持。總統支持這項法案嗎？ I’m not sure. I haven’t actually talked to the President about that bill, but I certainly can and can get a take on if he supports it or not.我不確定。我實際上沒有和總統談過那項法案，但我當然可以去問問，瞭解他是否支持。 Thank you. And one more. The D.C. Circuit ruled last week that the President can fire or hold over Biden appointees of independent agencies.謝謝。還有一個問題。哥倫比亞特區巡迴法院上週裁定，總統可以解僱或留任獨立機構中由拜登任命的人員。 Will this ruling empower President Trump to dismiss more federal employees?這項裁決是否會賦予特朗普總統解僱更多聯邦僱員的權力？ Well, the President has given the responsibility to his Cabinet Secretaries to hire and fire at their respective agencies, and they reserve that right.嗯，總統已將人事任免權賦予了他的內閣部長們，在各自的機構內，他們保留這項權利。 You saw the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced more layoffs today.你看到衛生與公衆服務部部長今天宣佈了更多的裁員。 This is all part of the administration’s effort for a mass reduction in force in the federal bureaucracy here in Washington, D.C., to save American taxpayers’ money.這都是政府努力大規模裁減華盛頓特區聯邦官僚機構的一部分，目的是爲美國納稅人省錢。 As for agencies within the President’s executive authority, the President retains that right.至於在總統行政權力範圍內的機構，總統保留這項權利。 And we’ve seen there have been bureaucrats at some of these agencies that have been trying to act independent.我們已經看到，在其中一些機構中，有些官僚試圖獨立行事。 They need to remember who they work for. It’s the executive of the executive branch. You look at the United States Institute of Peace, for example.他們需要記住他們爲誰工作。是行政部門的行政首長。比如，看看美國和平研究所。 There was a little bit of a standoff with bureaucrats over there who didn’t want to realize who they work for, and that is Donald Trump.那裏的官僚們有點僵持，他們不想意識到他們爲誰工作，那就是唐納德·特朗普。 And President Trump is focused on streamlining these agencies to save American taxpayers’ money, and he has every right to do that.特朗普總統專注於精簡這些機構以節省美國納稅人的錢，他完全有權這樣做。 Caroline. Caroline. Sure. Go ahead. Thanks, Carmen.卡羅琳。卡羅琳。當然。請講。謝謝，卡門。 In Gaza, the bodies of 15 rescuers have been found in their sort of ambulances where they were apparently killed by Israeli forces.在加沙，15 名救援人員的屍體在他們的救護車內被發現，他們顯然是被以色列軍隊殺害的。 Just wondering if the White House is gonna be calling on Israel to investigate that.只是想知道白宮是否會呼籲以色列對此進行調查。 And to try and avoid similar casualties involving the rest of the workers in the future.並試圖在未來避免涉及其他救援人員的類似傷亡。 Well, as for the specific situation you just mentioned, I’ll talk to the President about it and our national security team.嗯，關於你剛纔提到的具體情況，我會和總統以及我們的國家安全團隊談談。 What I can tell you is what I’ve spoken with the President on. He very much remains committed to backing Israel.我可以告訴你的是我和總統談過的內容。他仍然非常致力於支持以色列。 And it was only because of this President and his team’s leadership that we had a temporary ceasefire in Gaza that we were able to bring many hostages home.正是因爲這位總統和他團隊的領導，我們纔在加沙實現了臨時停火，能夠將許多人質帶回家。 And the President made it very clear to Hamas, “You get the hostages out, all of them, or there will be hell to pay.”總統已經非常明確地告訴哈馬斯：“把人質交出來，全部交出來，否則將付出慘重代價。” And Hamas is certainly witnessing what it feels like for all hell to be paid, and the President supports Israel’s right to defend itself.哈馬斯肯定正在體會付出慘重代價是什麼感覺，總統支持以色列的自衛權。 So, has he progressed at all on a ceasefire at the moment as far as the President’s concerned?那麼，就總統而言，目前在停火問題上是否有任何進展？ The President and his team continue to be engaged on this every single day.總統和他的團隊每天都在持續處理這個問題。 Sure. Thank you, Caroline. Go ahead, Tam. So, I’m just wondering, related to that, if you have an approximate date for the President’s first foreign trip.當然。謝謝你，卡羅琳。請講，塔姆。所以，我只是想知道，與此相關，您是否有總統首次出國訪問的大致日期？ I think there was a little confusion yesterday about what month he was talking about, and then, will he need a ceasefire to be in place or closer.我想昨天關於他談論的是哪個月份有點混亂，然後，他是否需要停火到位或接近停火。 Either in Gaza or in Ukraine, before that takes place? The President will be heading to Saudi Arabia in May.無論是在加沙還是烏克蘭，在他出訪之前？總統將於五月前往沙特阿拉伯。 As for specific dates and details, we will be reading those out to you as soon as we possibly can.至於具體日期和細節，我們會盡快向你們公佈。 I know our teams are working on the details of that trip.我知道我們的團隊正在處理那次訪問的細節。 And then, again, as for a ceasefire, the President’s made it clear that’s what he wants to see in Russia and Ukraine.然後，再次強調，關於停火，總統已經明確表示，這是他希望在俄羅斯和烏克蘭看到的。 And his team continues to be engaged on it every day. Kelly. You said case closed yesterday.他的團隊每天都在繼續處理這個問題。凱利。你昨天說案件結束了。 As that case was closed, do you have anything that you can share about what was learned.既然那個案件已經結束，你有什麼可以分享的關於從中吸取的教訓嗎？ How this can be avoided in the future, any sort of findings from that investigation?未來如何避免這種情況，那項調查有任何發現嗎？ The case is closed, and the President continues to have confidence in his national security advisor.案件已經結束，總統繼續對他的國家安全顧問充滿信心。 Yes, Kelly. Oh, thanks, Caroline. Sorry, Ed. Ed, I’ll come to you after. I’m glad you’re so eager to ask a question.是的，凱利。哦，謝謝，卡羅琳。抱歉，埃德。埃德，我稍後會叫你。我很高興你如此渴望提問。 It’s Liberation Day. Yes, it is. Caroline, the President has said foreign countries and companies will eat the cost of tariffs.今天是解放日。是的，沒錯。卡羅琳，總統說過外國和外國公司將承擔關稅成本。 In his speech on Inauguration Day, he said,在他就職典禮的演講中，他說， “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”“我們將對外國徵收關稅和稅收來富裕我們的公民，而不是向我們的公民徵稅來富裕其他國家。” So then why did he have to tell the domestic automakers not to raise prices? Well, that was a private conversation that was had.那麼他爲什麼還要告訴國內汽車製造商不要漲價呢？嗯，那是一次私下談話。 I’m not sure if that comment was made or was not made. But as for what the President said in his Inauguration Day speech, he’s absolutely correct.我不確定那個評論是否真的說過。但至於總統在他就職典禮演講中所說的，他絕對是正確的。 A tariff will be a tax on these foreign nations, these foreign companies, and if they want to be absolved of that tariff.關稅將是對這些外國國家、這些外國公司的稅收，如果他們想免除這項關稅。 Then they can come here to the United States of America to do business, bring their jobs here.那麼他們可以來美利堅合衆國做生意，把他們的工作帶到這裏。 Edward, go ahead. Thank you. So Canadians have been negotiating with the Commerce Secretary over the tariffs.愛德華，請講。謝謝。加拿大人一直在就關稅問題與商務部長進行談判。 How many companies are mutually talking with the U.S., or countries are mutually talking with the U.S. to lower tariffs?有多少公司或國家正在與美國相互協商以降低關稅？ I don’t have a specific number.我沒有具體的數字。 But I can tell you there have been quite a few countries that have called the President and have called his team in discussion about these tariffs.但我可以告訴你，已經有不少國家給總統和他的團隊打電話討論這些關稅問題。 But again, there’s one country the President cares most about, and it’s the United States of America.但再說一次，總統最關心的只有一個國家，那就是美利堅合衆國。 And doing what’s best for the people who elected him to this office to restore their jobs, their wealth, and their prosperity.併爲選舉他擔任此職的人們做最好的事情，恢復他們的工作、財富和繁榮。 I’m looking at the clock. I have a heart out today.我在看時間。我今天必須準時離開。 Excuse me, I have a heart out today because I’m actually heading over to the State Department with the First Lady of the United States.抱歉，我今天必須準時離開，因爲我正要和美國第一夫人一起去國務院。 She will be delivering remarks at 1 o’clock this afternoon at the 19th International Women of Courage Award Ceremony.她將於今天下午 1 點在第 19 屆國際婦女勇氣獎頒獎典禮上致辭。 With our great Secretary of State Marco Rubio that starts at 1.和我們偉大的國務卿馬可·盧比奧一起，典禮於 1 點開始。 This is the fifth year Mrs. Trump is participating and standing with brave women leaders who embody American values abroad.這是特朗普夫人第五年參與並支持那些在國外體現美國價值觀的勇敢女性領導人。 And the First Lady and her remarks today will highlight the profound connection between the love and courage that will be shown by this year’s honorees.第一夫人今天的講話將強調今年獲獎者所展現出的愛與勇氣之間的深刻聯繫。 I encourage everybody to tune in at 1 o’clock, and then we’ll see you all tomorrow for Liberation Day. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Caroline.我鼓勵大家在 1 點收看，然後我們明天解放日再見。謝謝大家。謝謝，卡羅琳。 【核心词汇 - B1_C2】 單詞 音標 詞性 釋義 等級 次數 Atlantic &#x2F;ətˈlæntɪk&#x2F; adjective 大西洋的 B1 1 Department &#x2F;dɪˈpɑːrtmənt&#x2F; noun 部門，部 B1 1 General &#x2F;ˈdʒenrəl&#x2F;

The President also signed a historic executive order to protect the integrity of American elections.很美的畫面。總統還簽署了一項歷史性的行政命令，以保護美國選舉的公正性。 By strengthening voter citizenship verification and banning foreign nationals from interfering in U.S. elections.通過加強選民公民身份驗證和禁止外國公民干預美國選舉。 These are the common-sense solutions that only Democrats could oppose.這些是隻有民主黨人纔會反對的常識性解決方案。 But voters deserve elections they can trust, and critical confidence is being restored thanks to President Trump’s leadership.但選民應該得到他們可以信任的選舉，並且由於特朗普總統的領導，關鍵的信心正在恢復。 Later this afternoon in the East Room, President Trump will mark Women’s History Month by honoring the exceptional women around our country,今天下午晚些時候在東廳，特朗普總統將通過表彰我們國家各地的傑出女性來紀念婦女歷史月， including the highly talented women in his administration and his Cabinet.包括他政府和內閣中才華橫溢的女性。 And on an additional scheduling update, the President will hold a press conference in the Oval Office today at 4 o’clock p.m. to announce tariffs on the auto industry.另外還有一個日程更新，總統今天下午4點將在橢圓形辦公室舉行新聞發佈會，宣佈對汽車行業徵收關稅。 And I will leave that to him to make that announcement later. Unfortunately, all of this good is happening for our country.我將把這個宣佈留給他稍後來做。不幸的是，所有這些好事都在爲我們國家發生。 (Note: The “Unfortunately” here seems misplaced or sarcastic in the original context, the translation reflects the literal word.)（注：原文這裏的“不幸的是”似乎用詞不當或帶有諷刺意味，翻譯反映了字面意思。） This administration is working hard on behalf of the American public every day,本屆政府每天都在爲美國公衆努力工作， but the mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalized story from the failing Atlantic magazine that is falling apart by the hour.但主流媒體繼續關注來自瀕臨倒閉的《大西洋月刊》的一篇聳人聽聞的報道，這篇報道正以每小時的速度瓦解。 Here are the facts.以下是事實。 The National Security Advisor has taken responsibility for this matter, and the National Security Council immediately said,國家安全顧問已對此事負責，國家安全委員會立即表示， alongside the White House Counsel’s office, that they are looking into how a reporter’s number was inadvertently added to this messaging thread.與白宮法律顧問辦公室一起，他們正在調查一名記者的號碼是如何被無意中添加到這個消息線程中的。 We have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread.我們一直說，這個消息線程中沒有發送任何機密材料。 There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed.沒有透露任何地點、來源或方法，當然也沒有討論任何戰爭計劃。 The Atlantic has even admitted this themselves.《大西洋月刊》自己甚至承認了這一點。 Their release of these internal messages validates the truth, which we have been saying all along.他們公佈這些內部信息驗證了真相，這也是我們一直所說的。 If this story proves anything, it proves that Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media.如果這個故事證明了什麼，那就是證明了民主黨人及其在主流媒體中的宣傳者。 Know how to fabricate, orchestrate, and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well.非常懂得如何捏造、策劃和散佈虛假信息運動。 And there’s arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg.可以說，媒體中沒有人比傑弗裏·戈德伯格更喜歡製造和推廣騙局了。 Goldberg is an anti-Trump hater. He is a registered Democrat.戈德伯格是一個反特朗普的憎恨者。他是一名註冊民主黨人。 Goldberg’s wife is also a registered Democrat and a big Democrat donor who used to work under who?戈德伯格的妻子也是一名註冊民主黨人，並且是一位重要的民主黨捐助者，她曾經在誰手下工作？ Hillary Clinton. This is the same Jeffrey Goldberg who infamously lied about weapons of mass destruction to get us into the Iraq War.希拉里·克林頓。就是這位傑弗裏·戈德伯格，曾臭名昭著地就大規模殺傷性武器撒謊，將我們拖入伊拉克戰爭。 Which cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers.那場戰爭耗費了數萬億美元和數千名美國士兵的生命。 And how else has Goldberg discredited himself?戈德伯格還通過哪些方式使自己聲名掃地？ By absurdly claiming that President Trump was Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign.通過在2016年競選期間荒謬地聲稱特朗普總統是弗拉基米爾·普京。 By peddling the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax that tried to hijack President Trump’s first term.通過兜售試圖劫持特朗普總統第一個任期的“通俄門、通俄門、通俄門”騙局。 By inventing the suckers and losers hoax to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election.通過捏造“笨蛋和失敗者”的騙局來幫助喬·拜登贏得2020年大選。 By peddling a hoax about President Trump involving Gold Star families to help Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, which our campaign at the time vigorously denied.通過兜售一個涉及金星家庭的關於特朗普總統的騙局來幫助卡瑪拉·哈里斯贏得2024年大選，我們當時的競選團隊對此予以強烈否認。 Jeffrey Goldberg didn’t care. There’s more, but we don’t have all day.傑弗裏·戈德伯格不在乎。還有更多，但我們沒有一整天的時間。 And we can now add this signal hoax to this very long list.現在我們可以把這個Signal騙局添加到這個很長的列表中了。 The real story here is the overwhelming success of President Trump’s decisive military action against Houthi terrorists.這裏的真實故事是特朗普總統對胡塞恐怖分子採取果斷軍事行動取得的壓倒性成功。 On March 15th, President Trump ordered a series of military operations against the terrorist Houthis to defend US shipping assets in the Red Sea,3月15日，特朗普總統下令對恐怖組織胡塞武裝採取一系列軍事行動，以保衛美國在紅海的航運資產， restore freedom of navigation for international shipping, and defend the United States from enemy threats.恢復國際航運的航行自由，並保衛美國免受敵人威脅。 United States forces successfully struck dozens of targets across Houthi controlled territory.美國軍隊成功打擊了胡塞武裝控制區內的數十個目標。 And as a result of these actions, several Houthi leaders were killed, including the Houthi drone chief, his deputy, and several of their drone experts and other key leaders.這些行動的結果是，幾名胡塞領導人被擊斃，包括胡塞組織的無人機負責人、他的副手以及他們的幾名無人機專家和其他關鍵領導人。 We also destroyed command and controlled facilities, weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapon storage locations.我們還摧毀了指揮和控制設施、武器製造設施以及先進武器儲存地點。 And it’s important to remember why this powerful action took place in the first place.重要的是要記住，爲什麼一開始就採取了這次強有力的行動。 Because of Joe Biden’s incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage for years, the Houthi terrorists grew emboldened.因爲喬·拜登多年來在世界舞臺上的無能和可悲的軟弱，胡塞恐怖分子變得更加膽大妄爲。 Immediately after taking office in 2021, Joe Biden removed the Iran-backed Houthis from the foreign terrorist organization in specifically designated global terrorist list.2021年一上任，喬·拜登就將伊朗支持的胡塞武裝從外國恐怖組織和特別指定的全球恐怖分子名單中移除。 Did anybody in this room ask the Biden administration at the time why they made such a stupid mistake?當時在座的各位，有誰問過拜登政府，他們爲什麼犯下如此愚蠢的錯誤？ This reckless action undid the designation put in place by President Trump during his first term, and what followed was predictable and devastating.這一魯莽的行動撤銷了特朗普總統在其第一任期內實施的認定，隨之而來的是可預見的、毀滅性的後果。 The Houthis targeted US military ships and aircraft, hit commercial ships, including US flagged vessels, threatened our personnel overseas and attacked our allies in the region.胡塞武裝襲擊了美國的軍艦和飛機，襲擊了包括懸掛美國國旗船隻在內的商船，威脅了我們在海外的人員，並襲擊了我們在該地區的盟友。 This resulted in more than a year of US flagged commercial ships being prevented from safely sailing through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden.這導致懸掛美國國旗的商船一年多無法安全通過蘇伊士運河、紅海和亞丁灣。 This had a massive negative impact on global trade of the economic security of the United States.這對全球貿易和美國的經濟安全造成了巨大的負面影響。 Joe Biden was the commander in chief, and he sat on his hands while the United States of America was bullied and embarrassed by terrorists.喬·拜登是總司令，但他卻袖手旁觀，任由美利堅合衆國被恐怖分子欺凌和羞辱。 President Trump and his team are putting a stop to these threats in restoring American strength around the world.特朗普總統及其團隊正在制止這些威脅，恢復美國在世界各地的實力。 The Trump “peace through strength” approach means no terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the waterways of the world.特朗普的“以實力求和平”方針意味着，沒有任何恐怖勢力能夠阻止美國的商業和海軍船隻在世界水道上自由航行。 But unfortunately, this is not what the Democrats and the media want to talk about.但不幸的是，這並不是民主黨和媒體想要談論的。 They are focused on a coordinated campaign to try and sow chaos in this White House.他們正專注於一場協調一致的運動，試圖在這個白宮製造混亂。 And this has been the most successful first two months of any administration ever, which is exactly why they are doing this.而這恰恰是有史以來任何一屆政府最成功的頭兩個月，這也正是他們這樣做的原因。 We are not going to bend in the face of this insincere outrage. And here is just one example of how bad faith the Democrats’ criticisms are.我們不會在這種虛僞的憤怒面前屈服。這裏有一個例子說明民主黨人的批評是多麼缺乏誠信。 Democrat Senator Mark Warner is hysterical over the use of Signal, which is an approved decrypted app, and the killing of Houthi terrorists.民主黨參議員馬克·華納對使用Signal（一款經批准的解密應用程序）以及擊斃胡塞恐怖分子感到歇斯底里。 But Senator Warner himself used Signal to work with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to connect the disgraced Steele dossier author who started the Russia hoax,但華納參議員本人卻使用Signal與一位俄羅斯寡頭的說客合作，聯繫上了聲名狼藉的斯蒂爾檔案的作者，正是他開始了通俄騙局， which Jeffrey Goldberg later reported on. How ironic.而傑弗裏·戈德伯格後來對此進行了報道。多麼諷刺。 We’re not going to lose focus of the bottom line, which is that Joe Biden’s weakness enabled an emboldened Houthi terrorists.我們不會忽視底線，那就是喬·拜登的軟弱助長了膽大妄爲的胡塞恐怖分子。 And President Trump’s strength in resolve eliminated those terrorists. Here in our new media seat today, we have Lindsay Keith.而特朗普總統的決心和力量消滅了那些恐怖分子。今天在我們新的媒體席位上，我們有林賽·基思。 She is the managing editor for Merit TV and serves as their White House correspondent.她是 Merit TV 的執行主編，並擔任他們的白宮記者。 Merit TV launched one year ago and creates and distributes content across diverse platforms.Merit TV 於一年前推出，在各種平臺上創作和分發內容。 We’re glad to have you with us, Lindsay. Please kick us off. Thank you, Caroline. I appreciate it and this opportunity for Merit TV.我們很高興你能和我們在一起，林賽。請你開始吧。謝謝你，卡羅琳。我很感激這次機會以及 Merit TV 的這次機會。 Two questions, if I may. One on Signal, one on the economy. Sure.如果可以的話，我有兩個問題。一個關於Signal，一個關於經濟。當然。 On Signal, how comfortable is the President with what was shared so far now that the chain has been released?關於Signal，既然信息鏈已經被公佈，總統對目前爲止分享的內容感覺如何？ The President’s view on all of this remains the same today as it did yesterday.總統對此事的看法今天和昨天一樣。 And I think it speaks volumes about the leadership of this President, that he went directly to all of you, members of the press corps.我認爲這充分說明了這位總統的領導力，他直接走向了你們各位，記者團的成員們。 He was asked, “Do you want someone else to go out and do a briefing?”有人問他：“你想讓別人出去做簡報嗎？” And he said, “No. I will tackle this story. I will discuss it. The people need to hear from me about this situation. “他說：“不。我將處理這個故事。我將討論它。人民需要聽到我關於這個情況的說明。” And so his thoughts on this remain the same today. He has placed great trust in his national security team.因此，他對此事的想法今天仍然保持不變。他對他的國家安全團隊給予了極大的信任。 And as for the usage of Signal, as the President said yesterday, as the CIA director has testified under oath, this is an approved app.至於Signal的使用，正如總統昨天所說，正如中央情報局局長在宣誓下作證所說，這是一款經過批准的應用程序。 It’s an encrypted app. The Department of Defense, the Department of State, the CIA has it loaded onto government phones.這是一款加密應用程序。國防部、國務院、中央情報局都已將其安裝在政府手機上。 Because it is the most secure and efficient way to communicate.因爲這是最安全、最高效的溝通方式。 As for, again, the original situation in this messaging thread, the National Security Council,至於，再次強調，這個消息線程中的最初情況，國家安全委員會， the White House Counsel’s Office continues to look in to how this mistake, which the National Security Advisor has owned, occurred.白宮法律顧問辦公室正在繼續調查這個錯誤是如何發生的，國家安全顧問已經承認了這一錯誤。 And the President has ensured they are doing that. On the economy, consumer confidence hit a four-year low this month.總統已確保他們正在這樣做。關於經濟，本月消費者信心指數跌至四年來的最低點。 Can you help explain to the American people how tariffs will help them in the long run? Yeah, absolutely.你能向美國人民解釋一下關稅從長遠來看將如何幫助他們嗎？是的，當然可以。 And I’m grateful for the question. The American public will hear later this afternoon from the President directly on the topic of tariffs.我很感謝這個問題。今天下午晚些時候，美國公衆將直接從總統那裏聽到關於關稅問題的講話。 And as you all know, April 2nd, President Trump has proudly dubbed it Liberation Day for our country.正如大家所知，4月2日，特朗普總統自豪地將其稱爲我們國家的解放日。 What he means by that is it will be a day where the United States of America will no longer be ripped off by nations around this world.他的意思是，這一天，美利堅合衆國將不再被世界各國敲詐勒索。 It will be a day where Americans finally see free and fair trade practices restored.這一天，美國人將最終看到自由公平的貿易慣例得以恢復。 We are no longer going to allow our allies, our competitors, and our adversaries to take advantage of American workers.我們不會再允許我們的盟友、競爭對手和對手佔美國工人的便宜。 And if you think about your hometown in the state that you grew up, Main Street looks a lot different today than it did many years ago.如果你想想你長大的那個州的家鄉，今天的主街看起來和多年前大不相同了。 And President Trump wants to restore America as a manufacturing superpower around the globe.特朗普總統希望將美國恢復爲全球製造業超級大國。 He wants products to be made right here in our great country with great, hardworking American hands.他希望產品就在我們偉大的國家，由偉大的、勤勞的美國人之手製造出來。 That will ultimately result in higher wages and more money in the pockets of the American people.這最終將導致更高的工資和美國人民口袋裏更多的錢。 And he’s also, in addition to tariffs, also determined to pass tax cuts later this year, as he did successfully in his first term,而且，除了關稅之外，他還決心在今年晚些時候通過減稅法案，就像他在第一個任期內成功做到的那樣， to put even more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans.將更多的錢放回辛勤工作的美國人的口袋裏。 Peter. Caroline, if I can ask you very quickly about the information we’ve seen, just to set the predicate to all this,彼得。卡羅琳，如果我可以非常快地問你關於我們所看到的信息，只是爲了給這一切設定前提， has the President been briefed and physically seen the, he’s seen all the details of the chat that is printed by the Atlantic?總統是否聽取了簡報並親眼看到了，他是否看到了《大西洋月刊》刊登的聊天記錄的所有細節？ I just spoke to the President about it, yes. Then let me ask you if I can very quickly.我剛和總統談過此事，是的。那麼請允許我很快地問一下。 In the chat, Pete Hex at the Defense Secretary details F-18s, Tomahawks, some of the weapons that were used.在聊天記錄中，國防部長的皮特·赫克斯詳細描述了F-18、戰斧導彈以及一些使用的武器。 (Note: Assuming “Pete Hex” is a typo for Pete Hegseth, the Defense Secretary mentioned later)（注：假設“Pete Hex”是後面提到的國防部長 Pete Hegseth 的筆誤） He details the timing involved for this, all of which occurred 31 minutes before, as he says F-18s would launch.他詳細說明了相關的時間安排，所有這些都發生在他所說的F-18起飛前31分鐘。 The DOD manual details classified information as significant military plans, saying that is secret, that that’s classified.國防部手冊將重大軍事計劃詳細列爲機密信息，稱其爲祕密，即機密。 So what about there are no methods, there are no sources, but that’s not what determines what’s classified.那麼，沒有方法，沒有來源，但這並不是決定什麼內容是機密的標準。 So what is it about what Pete Hex at the road that makes you say this is not classified?那麼，皮特·赫克斯所說的話中到底有什麼讓您說這不是機密呢？ (Note: “at the road” seems like a transcription error, likely meant “wrote”)（注：“at the road”似乎是轉錄錯誤，可能意爲“wrote”） Well, it’s not just me saying that, Peter. It’s the Secretary of Defense himself who is saying this as well.嗯，不只是我這麼說，彼得。國防部長本人也是這麼說的。 And he put out a very strong statement earlier today, listing all of the things that were not included in that message that he sent to the group.他今天早些時候發表了一份非常強硬的聲明，列出了他發送給小組的那條消息中未包含的所有內容。 And again, this message, there was no classified information transmitted, there were no war plans discussed.再次強調，這條信息沒有傳輸任何機密信息，也沒有討論任何戰爭計劃。 Why did the Atlantic downgrade their allegation about war plans to attack plans?爲什麼《大西洋月刊》將其關於戰爭計劃的指控降級爲攻擊計劃？ They’re now playing word games because they know this was sensationalist spin from a reporter who is well known for doing this.他們現在在玩文字遊戲，因爲他們知道這是一個以搞這種事聞名的記者製造的聳人聽聞的歪曲報道。 We have said all along no war plans were discussed, no classified material was sent.我們一直說沒有討論戰爭計劃，沒有發送機密材料。 You have the Secretary of Defense saying that.國防部長是這麼說的。 You have the director of the CIA, the director of national intelligence, the FBI director all testifying to that under oath, and they should be trusted with that.你有中央情報局局長、國家情報總監、聯邦調查局局長都在宣誓下爲此作證，他們應該在這方面被信任。 To be clear, Americans can make the decision for themselves, but whether is the.需要明確的是，美國人可以自己做決定，但是否是… (Sentence seems incomplete in the original)（原句似乎不完整） Sure. You said it’s not war plans. Would you characterize these as military plans, military operation plans?當然。您說這不是戰爭計劃。您會將其描述爲軍事計劃、軍事行動計劃嗎？ I would characterize this messaging thread as a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion, surely, amongst high-level cabinet officials and senior staff.我會將這個消息線程描述爲一次政策討論，當然是一次敏感的政策討論，是在高級內閣官員和高級職員之間進行的。 And I’m so glad, Peter, that you said the American public can decide for themselves, because I think the American public should decide for themselves based on the outcome of this operation.我很高興，彼得，你說了美國公衆可以自己決定，因爲我認爲美國公衆應該根據這次行動的結果自己決定。 And what happened in this operation, terrorists that were allowed to run wild by the Biden administration were killed because of the direction and the determination of this president and his team.在這次行動中發生的事情是，那些被拜登政府允許肆意妄爲的恐怖分子，因爲這位總統及其團隊的指揮和決心而被消滅了。 And this message also shows this messaging thread also proved that President Trump has an incredibly dynamic team who is working incredibly hard,這條信息也表明，這個消息線程也證明了，特朗普總統擁有一支極其充滿活力的團隊，他們正在極其努力地工作， flying all over the world to secure world peace and to fix up the foreign policy crises that the previous administration left for this team to inherit.飛往世界各地以確保世界和平，並收拾上一屆政府留給這個團隊繼承的外交政策危機。 So, to be clear, we all in this room and around the country would agree that we’re glad no American service members were harmed and we’re glad that the mission was a success.所以，需要明確的是，我們這個房間裏和全國各地的人都會同意，我們很高興沒有美國軍人受傷，我們很高興任務取得了成功。 We’ll stipulate that. But the president said that Pete Hegsett said none of this was classified.我們承認這一點。但是總統說皮特·赫格賽斯說過這些都不是機密。 So, given the president has seen it now and given the president understands that significant military plans are deemed classified as secret,那麼，鑑於總統現在已經看到了，並且鑑於總統理解重大的軍事計劃被視爲機密， how does the president view none of this, which details times and weapons and more, as being not classified?總統是如何看待這些詳細說明了時間、武器等信息的內容爲非機密的？ I’ve already been asked and answered this question.我已經問過並回答了這個問題。 The president’s thoughts on this remain the same today as they were yesterday, as well as the Secretary of Defense.總統對此事的想法今天和昨天一樣，國防部長也一樣。 This question has been asked and answered. There was no classified material discussed.這個問題已經被問過並且回答過了。沒有討論機密材料。 Jackie. On what basis I was asked? Go ahead, Jackie. Thank you, Caroline.傑基。基於什麼我被問到了？請說，傑基。謝謝你，卡羅琳。 So, why aren’t launch times on a mission strike classified?那麼，爲什麼任務打擊的發射時間不屬於機密？ Again, I would defer you to the Secretary of Defense’s statement he put out this morning.再次，我建議您參考國防部長今天早上發佈的聲明。 There were various reasons he listed things that were not included in that messaging thread that were not classified.他列舉了各種原因，說明了該消息線程中未包含的、非機密的內容。 And again, going back to the American public, do you trust the Secretary of Defense, who was nominated for this role,再次回到美國公衆，您是信任這位被提名擔任此職位、 voted by the United States Senate into this role, who has served in combat, honorably served our nation in uniform?由美國參議院投票選入此職位、曾在戰鬥中服役、光榮地穿着軍裝爲我們國家服務過的國防部長？ Or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg, who is a registered Democrat and an anti-Trump sensationalist reporter?還是信任傑弗裏·戈德伯格，一位註冊民主黨人和反特朗普的聳人聽聞的記者？ This president and this national security team are putting our national security and the American people first.這位總統和這個國家安全團隊將我們的國家安全和美國人民放在首位。 We are restoring American strength around the world, and the results of this operation speak for themselves.我們正在恢復美國在世界各地的實力，這次行動的結果不言自明。 Putting aside Jeffrey Goldberg, though, just for American service members who are gonna have to carry out these missions in the future,不過，拋開傑弗裏·戈德伯格不談，僅就未來將不得不執行這些任務的美國軍人而言， I guess the message that’s coming from the response to all this that we’re hearing is that, nothing sensitive happened.我猜我們聽到的對這一切的迴應所傳達的信息是，沒有發生任何敏感的事情。 And I guess the logical conclusion of that is that if these messages had gone out publicly prior to the launch, that that wouldn’t have been a risk to service members.我猜其邏輯結論是，如果這些信息在發射前公開發布，那也不會對軍人構成風險。 I don’t know that they’re comfortable with that. So, can you explain, you know, had these messages been published, would the plans have moved forward?我不知道他們是否對此感到安心。所以，你能解釋一下，你知道，如果這些信息被公佈了，計劃還會繼續推進嗎？ Would the launch have still taken off? What I can tell you is that the president, as the commander-in-chief of our United States Armed Forces,發射還會進行嗎？我能告訴你的是，總統，作爲我們美國武裝部隊的總司令， and Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is an incredible man and a war fighter himself,以及皮特·赫格賽斯部長，他本人是一位了不起的人，也是一位戰士， take the lives of our American service members with the utmost responsibility, and they would never do anything intentionally to put their lives at risk.以最大的責任感對待我們美國軍人的生命，他們絕不會故意做任何危及他們生命的事情。 And again, they are working hard on that every single day, and we are protecting our service members while also restoring peace throughout this globe.再次強調，他們每天都在爲此努力工作，我們在保護我們的軍人，同時也在恢復全球的和平。 It’s something the previous administration has not done. And I would just add one more point.這是上一屆政府沒有做到的事情。我只想再補充一點。 We are not going to be lectured about national security and American troops by Democrats in the mainstream media who turned the other cheek when the Biden administration,我們不會接受主流媒體中的民主黨人就國家安全和美國軍隊問題對我們說教，當拜登政府因爲無能 because of their incompetence, left 13 service members dead in Afghanistan,導致13名軍人在阿富汗喪生時，他們卻視而不見， and not a single person in the previous administration was held accountable for that botched withdrawal.而上一屆政府中沒有一個人爲那次拙劣的撤軍負責。 Joe Biden said, “In fact, it was a great operation.”喬·拜登說：“事實上，那是一次偉大的行動。” That is despicable. It’s unacceptable to this president and this secretary of defense.那是卑鄙的。這對於這位總統和這位國防部長來說是不可接受的。 The national security advisor has taken responsibility for this inadvertent number being added to the messaging thread,國家安全顧問已爲這個無意中添加到消息線程的號碼負責， but above all, we take the lives of our troops, safety, security, prosperity around the globe with the utmost seriousness.但最重要的是，我們以最嚴肅的態度對待我們軍隊的生命、全球的安全、保障和繁榮。 Karen, do you believe that he would release that to embarrass the administration ahead of the worldwide threats?凱倫，你相信他會爲了在面臨全球威脅之前讓政府難堪而公佈這些嗎？ Jennifer, go ahead. Given what you’ve said about the president’s trust in his national security team,詹妮弗，請說。鑑於您所說的總統對他的國家安全團隊的信任， can you say definitively that no one will lose their jobs, no one will lose their job at all because of this signal situation?您能明確地說，沒有人會因爲這次Signal事件而丟掉工作，絕對沒有人會丟掉工作嗎？ What I can say definitively is what I just spoke to the president about, and he continues to have confidence in his national security team.我能明確說的是我剛剛和總統談過的內容，他繼續對他的國家安全團隊充滿信心。 Karen, one more. Can I ask one more, Karen?凱倫，還有一個。我能再問一個嗎，凱倫？ On the targets in Yemen on March 15th, can you say were 100% of the targets that were planned for March 15th, were they all destroyed?關於3月15日在也門的目標，您能說計劃於3月15日打擊的目標是否100%都被摧毀了嗎？ Because that would be an indication if some of them were moved.因爲如果其中一些目標被移動了，這將是一個跡象。 But they were not all hit that maybe perhaps some of the enemies were able to get some of the information in that signal.但並非所有目標都被擊中，也許可能一些敵人能夠通過那個Signal獲取一些信息。 (Slightly awkward phrasing in original, kept meaning)（原文措辭略顯笨拙，保留了意思） What I can say about the operation is what the Department of Defense has put out there.關於這次行動，我能說的是國防部已經公佈的內容。 I would refer to them for any further operational details, but there have been more than 100 strikes conducted against Houthi targets,我建議您向他們諮詢任何進一步的行動細節，但已經對胡塞目標進行了100多次打擊， and they have hit key Houthi leaders, air defense systems, commanding control nodes, headquarters, weapons manufacturing, and storage facilities,並且打擊了關鍵的胡塞領導人、防空系統、指揮控制節點、總部、武器製造和儲存設施， and these operations will continue until the freedom of navigation in our seas is restored and US shipping can safely transmit without the fear of attack.這些行動將繼續進行，直到我們海域的航行自由得到恢復，美國船隻能夠安全通行而不用擔心受到攻擊。 And again, we believe that this has been a very successful operation thus far, and it will continue until this administration feels it no longer has to,再次強調，我們相信到目前爲止這是一次非常成功的行動，並且將繼續下去，直到本屆政府認爲不再需要爲止， and these terrorists have been taking out, which again is something previous administration should have done, but they didn’t, and now we’ve inherited this crisis.並且這些恐怖分子已經被清除，這又是上一屆政府本應做但沒有做的事情，現在我們繼承了這個危機。 Steve. Thank you, Caroline. I’d like to clarify something about the investigation and also ask about some conservative commentary.史蒂夫。謝謝你，卡羅琳。我想澄清一下關於調查的事情，並問一些關於保守派評論的問題。 On the investigation, Mike Waltz said last night that he had spoken to Elon Musk about figuring out how Jeffrey Goldberg’s number got in his phone.關於調查，邁克·沃爾茲昨晚說，他已經和埃隆·馬斯克談過，要弄清楚傑弗裏·戈德伯格的號碼是怎麼進入他手機的。 You mentioned the NSC and the White House Counsel’s Office investigating.你提到了國家安全委員會和白宮法律顧問辦公室正在調查。 Can you just clarify who is investigating, who’s leading that, and also Dave Portnoy, who endorsed President Trump, said today that he thinks that Mike Waltz should leave.你能否澄清一下是誰在調查，誰在領導調查，另外，支持特朗普總統的戴夫·波特諾伊今天說，他認爲邁克·沃爾茲應該離開。 Could you respond to that? Sure. Great respect for Dave Portnoy, but I just answered that previous question from Jennifer.你能迴應一下嗎？當然。非常尊重戴夫·波特諾伊，但我剛剛回答了詹妮弗之前的那個問題。 As for your original question about who’s leading, looking into the messaging thread, the National Security Council, the White House Counsel’s Office.至於你最初關於誰在領導調查消息線程的問題，是國家安全委員會、白宮法律顧問辦公室。 And also, yes, Elon Musk’s team. Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat.還有，是的，埃隆·馬斯克的團隊。埃隆·馬斯克已經提出讓他的技術專家參與進來，以查明這個號碼是如何被無意中添加到聊天中的。 Again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again.再次強調，是爲了承擔責任並確保這種情況永遠不會再次發生。 Carol Lynn. Caitlin. I have two questions, one on a follow-up on something you just said.卡羅爾·林恩。凱特琳。我有兩個問題，一個是關於你剛纔說的話的後續問題。 But since we have these messages released, and you said that the President has now personally reviewed them.但是既然這些信息已經公佈了，而且您說總統現在已經親自審閱了它們。 At the chat at one point, Pete Hexeth wrote, “1415, strike drones on target.” And in all caps, he said, “This is when the first bombs will definitely drop.”在聊天記錄的某個時刻，皮特·赫格賽斯寫道：“1415，打擊無人機命中目標。”他用全大寫字母說：“這是第一批炸彈肯定會投下的時候。” Does the President feel that he was misled by his national security advisors.總統是否覺得他被他的國家安全顧問誤導了。 Whoever it was that told him there was no classified information in there now that he’s seen these messages?無論當初是誰告訴他裏面沒有機密信息，既然他現在已經看到了這些信息？ I’ve now been asked and answered this question three times by the both of you, and I’ve given you my answer.你們倆現在已經問了我三次這個問題了，我也給出了我的答案。 The President feels the same today as he did yesterday. Sorry, am I follow-up on what you were just saying?總統今天的感受和昨天一樣。抱歉，我是不是要跟進你剛纔說的話？ Go ahead, Phillip. Caitlin, I’m not taking your follow-up. I have a follow-up on something you just said, though, Caroline.請說，菲利普。凱特琳，我不接受你的後續提問。不過，卡羅琳，我有一個關於你剛纔說的話的後續問題。 Caitlin, I’m not taking your follow-up. Phillip, go ahead. I have called on you.凱特琳，我不接受你的後續提問。菲利普，請說。我已經點到你了。 The Vice President seemed to express some frustration that Europe wasn’t doing more police waterways in their backyard,副總統似乎表達了一些不滿，認爲歐洲沒有在其後院的水道上做更多的警務工作， noting in that signal thread that 40% of European trade goes through the Suez Canal.在那個Signal線程中指出，40%的歐洲貿易通過蘇伊士運河。 Does the President share that opinion and frustration?總統是否持有同樣的觀點和不滿？ And then going forward, should the Europeans be responsible for policing that waterway?那麼未來，歐洲人是否應該負責管理那條水道？ Well, the President was asked this question yesterday by the pool in the Cabinet Room, and he answered this question.嗯，總統昨天在內閣會議室被記者團問到了這個問題，他回答了這個問題。 He said yes. He believes that Europe has been, as the Vice President put it.他說是的。他認爲歐洲一直以來，正如副總統所說的那樣。 Free-loading on the backs of American taxpayers and off the backs of the United States of America,一直在佔美國納稅人和美利堅合衆國的便宜（搭便車）， and he wants to ensure that Europe pays their fair share.他希望確保歐洲支付他們公平的份額。 He’s always been very honest and upfront about that, and I think the Vice President shares those concerns with him as well.他對此一直非常誠實和坦率，我認爲副總統也與他有同樣的擔憂。 Sure. Enlisted soldiers, sailors, and Marines would face consequences if they shared this type of information inadvertently with a reporter.當然。如果士兵、水手和海軍陸戰隊員無意中與記者分享了這類信息，他們將面臨後果。 Can you tell us more why the President is so willing to give Mike Waltz a mulligan here?您能告訴我們更多關於爲什麼總統如此願意在這裏給邁克·沃爾茲一次“重打”（原諒）的機會嗎？ Again, I have now been asked and answered this same question using different language multiple times.再次強調，我已經用不同的措辭多次被問及並回答了同一個問題。 If anybody has another question, there’s a lot of different things going on in the world.如果有人有其他問題，世界上正在發生很多不同的事情。 We have tariffs possibly being implemented later today. The President is going to talk about that at 4 o’clock this afternoon.今天晚些時候可能會實施關稅。總統今天下午4點會談到這個問題。 Sure, go ahead. Okay, thank you for taking my question.當然，請說。好的，謝謝您接受我的提問。 I wanted to first and foremost thank the administration for the Election Integrity Executive Order.我首先要感謝本屆政府發佈的選舉誠信行政命令。 Because so many journalists for four years were banned from talking about this very subject,因爲四年來，許多記者被禁止談論這個話題， so thank you to the administration for that.所以爲此感謝本屆政府。 My question is, yesterday, President Trump went on and the order said that there was more to come when it comes to election integrity.我的問題是，昨天，特朗普總統繼續說，並且該命令表示，在選舉誠信方面還會有更多措施。 Would that include same-day voting and hand-counted paper ballots?那會包括當日投票和手計紙質選票嗎？ And why are Democrats so against election integrity measures like, obviously, a proof of citizenship when it comes to voting in a United States election?爲什麼民主黨人如此反對選舉誠信措施，比如，很明顯，在美國大選中投票時需要提供公民身份證明？ Well, it’s a very good question. You’ll have to ask the Democrats why they’re against so many common-sense things, not just mandating voter ID.嗯，這是個很好的問題。你得問問民主黨人爲什麼他們反對這麼多常識性的事情，不僅僅是強制要求選民身份證明。 Why are they against men and women’s sports?爲什麼他們反對男子和女子體育運動？ Why are they against deporting foreign terrorists from American soil who have been designated a foreign terrorist organization?爲什麼他們反對將已被指定爲外國恐怖組織的外國恐怖分子驅逐出美國領土？ I’m referring to Trendy Aragwa.我指的是 Trendy Aragwa。（注：此名字可能爲音譯或轉錄錯誤，未找到明確指代對象） As for the Election Integrity Executive Order that the President signed yesterday, this is in an effort to restore trust in American elections.至於總統昨天簽署的選舉誠信行政命令，這是爲了努力恢復對美國選舉的信任。 There were more than 10 steps taken, 10 executive actions taken throughout this one order.這一個命令中採取了超過10個步驟，10項行政行動。 It directs the Department or the Attorney General, rather, in Homeland Security to prevent non-citizens from any involvement in administering elections.它指示司法部長，更確切地說，在國土安全部內，阻止非公民參與任何管理選舉的活動。 There’s also another host of actions. We can provide the fact sheet for you, but it’s a very strong Election Integrity Executive Order.還有一系列其他行動。我們可以爲您提供情況說明書，但這是一個非常強有力的選舉誠信行政命令。 And the President would also like to see Congress do something about this very important issue. And about Judge Bowie. Sure. Go ahead.總統也希望看到國會就這個非常重要的問題採取行動。還有關於鮑伊法官的事。當然。請說。 Caroline, the Republicans and Democrats alike have been expressing some concern about the frequency of which senior Trump officials have been using the Signal app.卡羅琳，共和黨人和民主黨人都對特朗普高級官員使用Signal應用的頻率表示了一些擔憂。 Has there been discussion, or will there be a review, about how often they use Signal?是否有過討論，或者是否會審查他們使用Signal的頻率？ And if you could explain to us how they might be considering other applications to get away from something like this happening again.您能否向我們解釋一下，他們可能正在考慮使用哪些其他應用程序，以避免類似情況再次發生。 Sure. Well, again, first of all, Signal has been an approved app for government use. It’s an encrypted app.當然。嗯，再次強調，首先，Signal一直是政府批准使用的應用程序。它是一款加密應用。 And as I said, it’s the most safe and efficient way of communicating, especially when people can’t be in a skiff or inside a room physically together.正如我所說，這是最安全、最高效的溝通方式，特別是當人們不能身處安全通訊室（skiff）或物理上共處一室時。 I think, as the President said yesterday, he wishes that everybody could be in the room, and it’s our goal to ensure that everybody can be.我認爲，正如總統昨天所說，他希望每個人都能在房間裏，我們的目標是確保每個人都能在。 But again, no classified information was discussed in this chat.但再次強調，這次聊天中沒有討論任何機密信息。 And any time classified information is discussed amongst high-level officials across this administration,在本屆政府中，任何時候高級官員之間討論機密信息時， secure lines of communication are used, including, by the way, our special envoy, Steve Witkoff,都會使用安全的通信線路，順便說一句，包括我們的特使史蒂夫·威特科夫， who I understand the Wall Street Journal erroneously reported that he was on this Signal chat on a personal device while in Moscow.據我瞭解，《華爾街日報》錯誤地報道說，他在莫斯科時使用個人設備參與了這個Signal聊天。 That is absolutely false. Steve Witkoff did not have his personal device, nor did he have his government device with him.那絕對是假的。史蒂夫·威特科夫既沒有攜帶他的個人設備，也沒有攜帶他的政府設備。 He was given a classified, protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.美國政府給了他一個機密的、受保護的服務器，他在俄羅斯期間對自己的通訊非常謹慎。 So rest assured to the American public, this administration is taking every precaution when it comes to protecting our national security.所以請美國公衆放心，本屆政府在保護我們國家安全方面正在採取一切預防措施。 And that’s why the American people re-elected this President, because they know that our national security is in good hands with the President of the United States.這就是爲什麼美國人民再次選舉這位總統，因爲他們知道我們的國家安全掌握在美利堅合衆國總統手中是安全的。 Speaking of the Vice President, I understand he’s going to be speaking any moment now.說到副總統，我瞭解到他馬上就要講話了。 I would hate to counter-program the Vice President of the United States. You’ll also hear from the President at 3 o’clock.我可不想和美利堅合衆國副總統的節目衝突。你們也會在3點鐘聽到總統的講話。 He will be honoring women’s history at the Women’s History Month celebration.他將在婦女歷史月慶祝活動上表彰婦女歷史。 We have a lot of great women across our Cabinet who will be in attendance, so we’ll see you all there.我們內閣中有很多傑出的女性將出席，所以我們到時見。 And then you’ll also hear from the President again at 4 o’clock when he talks about tariffs.然後你們還會在4點鐘再次聽到總統談論關稅問題。 So plenty of time for more questions. Sorry it’s a bit shorter today, guys. We’ll see you later.所以還有足夠的時間提更多問題。抱歉今天時間有點短，各位。我們稍後再見。 【核心词汇 - B1_C2】 單詞 音標 詞性 釋義 等級 次數 Atlantic &#x2F;ətˈlæntɪk&#x2F; adjective 大西洋的 B1 1 Department &#x2F;dɪˈpɑːrtmənt&#x2F; noun 部門，部 B1 1 Election

the world’s transition to sustainable energy.我们的使命是加速世界向可持续能源的转型。 It’s only possible because of the incredible people here at Tesla.这只有通过特斯拉这里杰出的人们才有可能实现。 They are absolutely committed to the cause of sustainable energy, and that is why we can do what no other company can do.他们绝对致力于可持续能源的事业，这就是为什么我们可以做到其他公司做不到的事情。 We can make lower-cost products that are still efficient and compelling, and we can make them at scale.我们可以制造更低成本的产品，同时仍然高效且引人注目，而且我们可以大规模地生产它们。 We’re going to build them all in compact and high-output factories that are easy for us to build quickly.我们将在紧凑且高产的工厂里建造它们，这些工厂对我们来说很容易快速建造。 We work together in a way that allows us to ask the hard questions.我们以一种允许我们提出难题的方式一起工作。 This is the product that will retire fossil fuels.这是将淘汰化石燃料的产品。 We’re not just creating products, we’re creating a movement for sustainable energy for everyone.我们不仅仅是在创造产品，我们还在为每个人创造一场可持续能源的运动。 What we’re trying to convey is a message of hope and optimism.我们试图传达的是一种希望和乐观的信息。 Optimism that is based on actual physics.这种乐观是基于实际物理学的。 Earth can and will move to a sustainable energy economy, and will do so in your lifetime.地球能够并将转向可持续能源经济，并且将在您的有生之年实现。 The solution to scalable FSD is getting the architecture, the data, and the compute just right, and we have assembled a world-class team to execute on this.可扩展FSD的解决方案是使架构、数据和计算恰到好处，我们已经组建了一个世界一流的团队来执行此任务。 Every truck that we put on the road that replaces a diesel truck makes a huge difference towards driving us towards our total mission of sustainable energy and transportation.我们投入到道路上的每一辆取代柴油卡车的卡车，都对推动我们实现可持续能源和交通运输的总体使命产生了巨大影响。 You can see and you can feel the collaboration that’s happening and the pride that everyone has in working for Tesla.你可以看到和感受到正在发生的合作，以及每个人在特斯拉工作的自豪感。 All right.好的。 Well, let me start off first by thanking everyone at Tesla for your incredible hard work.首先，让我先感谢特斯拉的每一个人，感谢你们令人难以置信的辛勤工作。 I mean, the Tesla team is an incredible team, great human beings.我的意思是，特斯拉团队是一个令人难以置信的团队，伟大的人类。 I mean, some of the finest people in the world work at Tesla.我的意思是，世界上最优秀的人才都在特斯拉工作。 Designing and manufacturing are incredible products.设计和制造都是令人难以置信的产品。 So, my thanks to you for everything you’re doing.所以，我感谢你们所做的一切。 Well done.做得好。 So, we’re going to go through just a list of the incredible achievements of the Tesla team.所以，我们将快速浏览一下特斯拉团队取得的令人难以置信的成就清单。 We’ve now produced over 7 million vehicles.我们现在已经生产了超过700万辆汽车。 7 million!700万辆！ In our first year of production, we produced just over 20 vehicles.在我们的第一个生产年度，我们只生产了20多辆汽车。 And I thought, well, maybe we might one day be able to do 10 or 20 a week instead of 10 or 20 a year.我当时想，嗯，也许有一天我们能够每周生产10或20辆，而不是每年生产10或20辆。 And the way things are tracking right now, we will actually have made over 10 million vehicles next year.按照目前的发展趋势，我们明年实际上将生产超过1000万辆汽车。 So, we’ll pass the 10 million vehicle cumulative.所以，我们将超过1000万辆汽车的累计产量。 That’s a lot of cars, man.那真是很多车啊，伙计。 That’s a lot of cars.那真是很多车。 So, it’s really, and it’s incredibly difficult, as you know, to design, to build, to manage the supply chain with thousands of suppliers, make sure everything arrives.所以，真的，而且非常困难，如您所知，要设计、制造、管理与数千家供应商的供应链，确保一切都到位。 You’ve got tens of thousands of parts, make sure everything works.你有成千上万个零件，确保一切正常工作。 Then build the car, service the car, and it’s really difficult.然后制造汽车，维修汽车，这真的很难。 I mean, frankly, the car business is a tough business.我的意思是，坦率地说，汽车行业是一个艰难的行业。 So, and, you know, there are times when there are rocky moments, like things are, like a little bit of stormy weather.所以，而且，你知道，有时会有艰难的时刻，比如事情进展不顺，就像遇到一点暴风雨天气。 But what I’m here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting.但我要告诉你们的是，未来无比光明和令人兴奋。 And we’re going to do things that no one, I think, has even dreamed of.我们将要做一些我认为没有人甚至梦想过的事情。 You know, we’ve said we’re going to do it, but I think until we actually do it, people won’t believe just how incredible it is.你知道，我们说过我们要这样做，但我认为在我们真正做到之前，人们不会相信它有多么不可思议。 So, I’m going to go through all of the things that we’re accomplishing here.所以，我将回顾我们在这里正在完成的所有事情。 So, once again, thank you very much.所以，再次感谢大家。 You know, it’s worth noting that Tesla remains the company of choice for people to work for.你知道，值得注意的是，特斯拉仍然是人们工作的首选公司。 So, we get millions of applications per year for a very small number of spots.所以，我们每年收到数百万份申请，但只有极少数名额。 And we continue to be the leading organization, along with SpaceX, for engineering talent in the world and also for manufacturing talent.我们仍然是世界领先的工程人才和制造人才的组织，与SpaceX并驾齐驱。 Really for, it’s like it’s an awesome place to work, basically.真的，基本上，这是一个很棒的工作场所。 And because of our growth, there’s a lot of opportunity for upward mobility.而且由于我们的增长，有很多向上流动的机会。 And I’m going to talk you through just, you know, how I see the future unfolding and why I think it is going to be incredible.我将向您介绍一下，你知道，我如何看待未来的发展，以及为什么我认为它将是令人难以置信的。 So, first of all, as always, we care a lot about safety, so the safety of our cars and the safety of people within the factory.所以，首先，和往常一样，我们非常关心安全，所以我们汽车的安全和工厂内部人员的安全。 So, you can see that our work-related injuries have declined over time.所以，你可以看到我们的工伤事故随着时间的推移而减少。 So, thank you for helping make that happen.所以，感谢你们帮助实现这一点。 That’s a collaborative effort.这是一项协作努力。 So, congratulations to the safety team on continuing to improve workplace safety.所以，祝贺安全团队继续提高工作场所安全。 So, one of the things that may seem like, how do you pull it all together is, you know, where does AI and robots fit in this sort of sustainable energy picture?所以，其中一件事可能看起来像，你如何将所有这些结合在一起，你知道，人工智能和机器人如何融入这种可持续能源的蓝图中？ Like, is that just like some weird side project or what, you know?就像，这只是某种奇怪的副项目还是什么，你知道吗？ But it’s because what we’re really aiming for here is, maybe a better way to think about it rather than sustainable energy is sustainable abundance for all.但这因为我们真正追求的是，也许一个更好的思考方式不是可持续能源，而是所有人都可以持续获得丰盈。 So, if you think about, like, what is the future that would, what’s the most exciting future that you could possibly imagine?所以，如果你想想，比如，什么样的未来会，你所能想象的最令人兴奋的未来是什么？ Like, what does that future look like?就像，那个未来是什么样的？ It’s worth thinking about that.值得思考一下。 Just think, just imagine a future.想想，想象一下未来。 What does that amazing future look like?那个令人惊叹的未来是什么样的？ How about a future where you can have any good or service you want, at will?如果未来你可以随意获得任何你想要的商品或服务呢？ A future of abundance for all, where really anyone can have anything.一个所有人都可以获得丰盈的未来，在那里，真的每个人都可以拥有任何东西。 It sounds impossible.这听起来不可能。 It sounds like surely such a thing cannot be the case.这听起来肯定不会是这样的。 But what I’m here to tell you is that that will indeed be the case.但我要告诉你们的是，情况确实如此。 That the future we’re headed for is one where you can literally just have anything you want.我们所走向的未来是，你可以真正拥有你想要的任何东西。 Like, if there’s a good or service you want, you’ll be able to have it, and ultimately everyone in the world will be able to have anything they want.比如，如果你想要某种商品或服务，你就能得到它，最终世界上每个人都能拥有他们想要的任何东西。 What’s key to that is robotics and AI.其中的关键是机器人技术和人工智能。 So, once you have self-driving cars and you have autonomous humanoid robots, where everyone can have their own personal C3PO and R2D2, but even better than that, that’s optimus.所以，一旦你拥有了自动驾驶汽车，并且拥有了自主的人形机器人，每个人都可以拥有自己的C3PO和R2D2，甚至比那更好，那就是擎天柱。 You can imagine, like, your own personal robot buddy that is a great friend but also takes care of your house.你可以想象，比如，你自己的私人机器人伙伴，它是一个好朋友，同时也照顾你的房子。 Will clean your house, will mow the lawn, will walk the dog, will teach your kids, will babysit, and will also enable the production of goods and services, basically with no limit.会打扫你的房子，会修剪草坪，会遛狗，会教你的孩子，会照顾孩子，还会实现商品和服务的生产，基本上没有限制。 And when you combine that with sustainable energy from the sun and batteries, we can at the same time also maintain a great environment.当你把这与来自太阳和电池的可持续能源结合起来时，我们也可以同时保持一个良好的环境。 So that, I think, is the future that we want.所以，我认为，这就是我们想要的未来。 A future where nobody’s in need.一个没有人需要的未来。 You can have what you want.你可以拥有你想要的。 But we still have nature.但我们仍然拥有大自然。 We still have the beautiful parts of nature that we like.我们仍然拥有我们喜欢的大自然的美丽部分。 I think that’s probably the best future.我认为这可能是最好的未来。 What other future would you want?你还想要什么样的未来？ I think that’s, like, the cool future.我认为，那就像，很酷的未来。 Space travel, let’s not forget that.太空旅行，让我们不要忘记这一点。 So if you can have basically anything you want and travel to space and go to Mars, that would be about as good as it gets.所以，如果你基本上可以拥有你想要的任何东西，并且可以去太空旅行，去火星，那就差不多是最好了。 It’s like, that’s it.就像，就是这样。 So what we’re trying to do is take the set of actions most likely to lead to a great future for all.所以我们试图做的是采取最有可能为所有人带来美好未来的行动。 So that’s what I mean by sustainable abundance.所以这就是我所说的可持续丰盈。 And the combination of things that we’re making with Optimus and AI Compute will achieve an age of abundance for all.我们将使用擎天柱和人工智能计算制造的各种东西的结合将实现所有人的丰盈时代。 Like, actually.真的。 So it’s going to be pretty great.所以它会非常棒。 Model Y became the best-selling vehicle in the world.Model Y 成为世界上最畅销的汽车。 You know, FYI, we do make the best. How are we doing on popularity?你知道，顺便说一句，我们确实制造了最好的。我们在受欢迎程度方面做得怎么样？ Well, we actually literally make the best-selling car on Earth of any kind.嗯，实际上，我们确实制造了地球上任何类型的最畅销汽车。 So that ends for two years in a row.所以，它连续两年都是这样。 And it’s going to be the best-selling car on Earth again this year.今年它将再次成为地球上最畅销的汽车。 The Cybertruck became the best-selling electric vehicle pickup instantly, because it’s awesome.Cybertruck 立即成为最畅销的电动皮卡，因为它太棒了。 And Tesla was the best-selling electric vehicle in Europe, the fastest growing brand in South Korea.特斯拉是欧洲最畅销的电动汽车，也是韩国增长最快的品牌。 And we launched in a lot of new markets, including Qatar, Lithuania, Chile, and the Philippines.我们进入了很多新市场，包括卡塔尔、立陶宛、智利和菲律宾。 And we’ll be opening in a whole bunch more markets as well.我们还将在更多市场开设业务。 So Teslas will be available worldwide.所以特斯拉将在全球范围内销售。 So overall, you know, it’s good.总的来说，你知道，这很好。 If you read the news, it feels like, you know, Armageddon.如果你阅读新闻，感觉就像，你知道，世界末日。 So it’s like, I can’t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.所以就像，我走过电视机前，总是看到一辆特斯拉着火。 You’re like, what’s going on?你就会想，发生了什么事？ You know, some people, it’s like, listen, I understand if you don’t want to buy our product, but you don’t have to burn it down, that’s a bit unreasonable, you know.你知道，有些人，就像，听着，我理解如果你不想购买我们的产品，但你不必把它烧掉，这有点不合理，你知道。 Like, this is psycho.就像，这太疯狂了。 Still being psycho.还是太疯狂了。 Okay.好吧。 So, and we launched the new Model Y. Congrats to the team on Tesla.所以，我们推出了新款Model Y。祝贺特斯拉团队。 That’s obviously very tough because we’ve got factories all across the world.这显然非常困难，因为我们在世界各地都有工厂。 And we’ve got a change of a global supply chain on three, basically three supply chains on three continents.而且我们在三个大陆上改变了全球供应链，基本上是三个供应链。 And I think you did an amazing job of switching over the world’s best-selling car globally in a very short period of time.我认为你们在很短的时间内就在全球范围内完成了世界畅销汽车的转换，做得非常出色。 Well done, guys.做得好，伙计们。 And this, I’ll forget, also we upgraded Model 3 last year.还有这个，我会忘记的，我们去年也升级了Model 3。 So I would encourage people to also buy the Model 3.所以我会鼓励人们也购买Model 3。 It’s a great car.这是一辆很棒的汽车。 So, and the Cybertruck has achieved five-star safety.所以，Cybertruck已经获得了五星级安全评级。 You know, these days, you know, sometimes things get a little dangerous in the neighborhood.你知道，现在，你知道，有时社区里会发生一些危险的事情。 The Cybertruck, being bulletproof and all, can come in handy.Cybertruck，由于是防弹的，可能会派上用场。 So, but apart from being bulletproof, it’s also very safe in a crash.所以，但除了防弹之外，它在碰撞中也很安全。 We’re also building the Tesla Semi Factory.我们还在建造特斯拉Semi工厂。 This is a vehicle that some people said was impossible to build, that it defied physics.这是一款有些人说不可能建造的汽车，它违背了物理学。 Well, not only does it not defy physics, we’re going to be making a lot of them.嗯，它不仅没有违背物理学，我们还将制造很多。 So we’re going to make just a, you know, I think ultimately we’ll make over a million, millions probably, of the Tesla Semi.所以我们将制造，你知道，我认为最终我们将制造超过一百万辆，可能数百万辆的特斯拉Semi。 And this is really going to be something that you’ll see all over the place.这真的会是你随处可见的东西。 And it’ll also be autonomous or have the ability to go autonomous down the road.而且它也将是自动的，或者将来具有自动驾驶的能力。 So, really, autonomy is a massive, massive thing.所以，真的，自主性是一件非常非常重要的事情。 The future is autonomous.未来是自主的。 So, I always sort of think, like, what will the future look like in five years or ten years, twenty years?所以，我总是想，比如，五年、十年、二十年后，未来会是什么样？ And five years from now, autonomous cars are going to be everywhere, primarily going to be Teslas, by the way.五年后，自动驾驶汽车将无处不在，顺便说一句，主要是特斯拉。 But autonomous Teslas will be everywhere.但自动驾驶特斯拉将无处不在。 And I think in five years, probably we’ll have regulatory approval, I think globally.我认为五年后，我们可能会获得监管部门的批准，我认为在全球范围内。 So you’ll have autonomous Teslas on every continent, taking people on trips.所以你将在每个大陆上都看到自动驾驶特斯拉，带着人们去旅行。 And almost the entire fleet, which will pass ten million vehicles next year, is capable of full autonomy.几乎整个车队，明年将超过1000万辆汽车，都具有完全自主驾驶的能力。 So even without the cyber cab, we still actually have a gigantic fleet that is capable of being autonomous.所以即使没有cyber cab，我们实际上仍然拥有一支庞大的车队，能够实现自主驾驶。 And the thing about being an autonomous car is that it can be used much more than a car that is not autonomous.自动驾驶汽车的特点是，它可以比非自动驾驶汽车使用更多。 A typical passenger vehicle car will be used about ten hours a week.一辆典型的乘用车每周将被使用大约十个小时。 So people might use it for an hour and a half a day on average for seven days, which is about ten hours a week.所以人们可能会平均每天使用它一个半小时，持续七天，这大约是一周十个小时。 But there are 168 hours in a week.但一周有168个小时。 So if you have a car that’s a robot car that can drive autonomously, it can now be used potentially for 80, maybe 100 hours a week.所以如果你有一辆可以自动驾驶的机器人汽车，它现在每周可能会被使用80个小时，甚至100个小时。 So you could have a car that has ten times the usefulness of a non-autonomous car, but it still costs the same.所以你可以拥有一辆其效用是非自动驾驶汽车十倍的汽车，但它的成本仍然相同。 In fact, the fleet’s already built.事实上，车队已经建成。 So the software update just enables that capability.所以软件更新只是启用了该功能。 Overnight, you have an increase in usefulness of ten million cars that suddenly become like 50 million cars or maybe 80 or 100 million cars of usefulness overnight.一夜之间，你有了一千万辆汽车的效用增加，突然变得像五千万辆汽车，甚至八千万或一亿辆汽车的效用一夜之间。 That’s a profound thing.这是一件深刻的事情。 Nothing like that has ever happened before.以前从未发生过类似的事情。 There is no analogy that there’s no, there’s never been something where a software update increased the value of a gigantic asset base by a factor of like 500 to 1,000 percent.没有类比，从来没有任何东西，软件更新将一个巨大的资产基础的价值提高了500%到1000%。 So it’s very difficult for people in the stock market, especially those that look in the rear view mirror.所以对于股市中的人来说，这非常困难，尤其是那些只看后视镜的人。 Which is most people, to imagine a future where suddenly a ten million vehicle fleet has five to ten times the usefulness.大多数人，难以想象一个未来，突然拥有一千万辆汽车的车队具有五到十倍的效用。 It’s so profound and there’s no comparison with anything in the past that they just can’t, it does not compute.这是如此深刻，而且与过去没有任何可比性，他们只是无法理解，它无法计算。 But it will compute in the future.但它会在未来计算出来。 And some people like Kathy Wood at ARK Invest do see the future.一些像ARK Invest的凯西·伍德这样的人确实看到了未来。 So what I’m saying is hang on to your stock.所以我想说的是，坚持持有你的股票。 So, yeah, it’s really, it’s mind blowing.所以，是的，这真的令人难以置信。 Then I want to give a shout out to service.然后我想对服务部门表示敬意。 Service is a tough job, an important job, and it’s actually what sells cars long term.服务是一项艰巨的工作，一项重要的工作，它实际上是长期销售汽车的原因。 You know, because the initial car is sold with sales, but all future cars are sold with service.你知道，因为最初的汽车是通过销售售出的，但所有未来的汽车都是通过服务售出的。 And I always encourage our service team, like, let’s try to give people a service experience that they love.我总是鼓励我们的服务团队，比如，让我们尝试给人们一种他们喜欢的服务体验。 Not merely that they like, but that they love.不仅仅是他们喜欢，而是他们热爱。 Because people will talk about something that they love that was an amazing experience, but they don’t talk that much about things that they like.因为人们会谈论他们喜欢的东西，那是一种很棒的体验，但他们不会过多地谈论他们喜欢的东西。 You have to really do something amazing.你必须真正做一些令人惊叹的事情。 And then they’ll talk about it and be like, wow, that’s incredible.然后他们会谈论它，然后说，哇，这太不可思议了。 So thank you to the service team for the great job you do.所以感谢服务团队你们的出色工作。 And you can see sort of, I like this light map of superchargers.你可以看到，我喜欢这张超级充电站的光照地图。 You can see you can go practically anywhere in the U.S., Mexico, Europe, China.你可以看到，你几乎可以去美国的任何地方，墨西哥，欧洲，中国。 Well, I guess not the outback of Australia.嗯，我想不是澳大利亚的内陆地区。 But, you know, most of the places where people live.但是，你知道，大多数人居住的地方。 So our supercharger network continues to grow significantly.所以我们的超级充电站网络继续显着增长。 And we keep upgrading our superchargers.我们不断升级我们的超级充电站。 In fact, I still run into a lot of people who don’t realize that you can drive.事实上，我仍然遇到很多人，他们没有意识到你可以开车。 You can take your Tesla on a road trip anywhere in America or anywhere in Europe, anywhere, pretty much anywhere in China, just using the Tesla supercharger network.你可以驾驶你的特斯拉去美国或欧洲的任何地方旅行，几乎可以在中国的任何地方旅行，只需使用特斯拉的超级充电站网络。 And it’s actually easy and convenient.而且它实际上很容易和方便。 So people think that whatever the range of the car is, that’s as far as they can go.所以人们认为无论汽车的续航里程是多少，他们只能走那么远。 It’s like, no, you just stop at a supercharger network.就像，不，你只需在超级充电站网络停下来。 The car’s battery will last longer than your bladder.汽车的电池比你的膀胱持续的时间更长。 I’m pretty confident.我非常有信心。 So that’s really the threshold.所以这才是真正的门槛。 As long as the car battery lasts longer than your bladder and you just plug it in when you go to the restroom and you come back and grab a coffee.只要汽车电池的持续时间比你的膀胱长，而且你在去洗手间时把它插上，然后你回来喝杯咖啡。 Or whatever and you’re back on the road and everything’s good.或者不管什么，你回到路上，一切都很好。 Then that’s the range that matters and the supercharging speed that matters.那么这就是重要的续航里程和重要的超级充电速度。 So, yes, so congrats to the supercharger team on expanding that work.所以，是的，所以祝贺超级充电站团队扩展了这项工作。 You did great work there.你们在那里做了很棒的工作。 And then, I mean, the MegaPak and PowerWall team are really knocking it out of the park.然后，我的意思是，MegaPak和PowerWall团队真的做得非常出色。 The demand for stationary battery storage is gigantic.对固定电池存储的需求是巨大的。 And I think that is actually only going to increase dramatically over time.我认为随着时间的推移，这种情况只会大幅增加。 So, and we’ve got the Shanghai MegaFactory that got started in record time in February.所以，我们在二月份开设了上海MegaFactory，该工厂在创纪录的时间内启动。 Congrats to the Shanghai factory team there.祝贺上海工厂团队。 That’s awesome.太棒了。 And the PowerWall 3 is, it usually takes about three major technology iterations for the product to be great.PowerWall 3通常需要大约三个主要的技术迭代，产品才能变得很棒。 And the PowerWall 3 really is a fantastic home energy product.PowerWall 3确实是一款出色的家用能源产品。 And it’s something that if you want to ensure that your home has uninterrupted power during a power outage, the PowerWall 3 is the way to go.如果你想确保你的家在停电期间拥有不间断的电力，PowerWall 3是一个不错的选择。 And if you combine that with solar, you can basically be off-grid, which is pretty cool.如果你把它与太阳能结合起来，你基本上可以脱离电网，这非常酷。 But I think just having energy insurance, like being, or energy assurance, such that if the utility goes down, you don’t even notice.但我认为仅仅拥有能源保险，或者说是能源保障，这样，如果公用事业公司倒闭了，你甚至不会注意到。 Like the lights are on in your house and your neighbors will come to you for help, basically.就像你家里的灯亮着，你的邻居会来找你帮忙，基本上就是这样。 That’s actually what happens when somebody has a Tesla PowerWall and there’s a power outage.当有人拥有特斯拉PowerWall并且停电时，实际上会发生这种情况。 So that’s a great product.所以这是一个很棒的产品。 And then, yeah, MegaPak, especially at the utility scale, is the opportunity there is gigantic because it enables a utility grid to dramatically increase the output of electricity.然后，是的，MegaPak，尤其是在公用事业规模上，那里的机会是巨大的，因为它使公用事业电网能够显着提高电力输出。 Because you can generate electricity at night and then MegaPak can provide that electricity during the day because normal electricity demand is very uneven.因为你可以在晚上发电，然后MegaPak可以在白天提供电力，因为正常的电力需求非常不均衡。 There’s a lot of electricity usage during the day, but limited at night.白天有很多电力使用，但在晚上有限制。 So MegaPak actually has the potential to increase the output of an existing electricity grid by more than double.所以MegaPak实际上有潜力将现有电网的输出增加一倍以上。 So you can actually, without building additional power plants, double the total output of energy in a year.所以你实际上可以在不建造额外发电厂的情况下，将一年的总能量输出增加一倍。 So that’s quite a profound thing.所以这是一件非常深刻的事情。 Yeah, so MegaPak is also really good at stabilizing the grid.是的，所以MegaPak也非常擅长稳定电网。 So if there’s variations in power in the grid, the MegaPak can absorb.所以如果电网中的电力有变化，MegaPak可以吸收。 If there’s a big power spike, it can absorb and store the power.如果出现大的电力尖峰，它可以吸收和存储电力。 And then if there’s a drop in power, it can fill in the gap.然后如果电力下降，它可以填补空白。 So MegaPak is excellent for stabilizing the grid and obviously it matches very well with wind and solar.所以MegaPak非常适合稳定电网，显然它与风能和太阳能非常匹配。 In fact, satellites are just solar panels and a battery.事实上，卫星只是太阳能电池板和电池。 That’s how all satellites work.所有卫星都是这样工作的。 And with the Starlink satellite network, there’s 7,000 satellites orbiting the Earth, and all they use is solar panels and a battery.使用Starlink卫星网络，有7,000颗卫星绕地球运行，它们使用的只是太阳能电池板和电池。 My prediction is long term, a majority of power on Earth.我的预测是长期来看，地球上的大部分电力。 In fact, eventually it might be like 90% or more of all power on Earth will be solar panels with batteries.事实上，最终可能地球上90%甚至更多的电力将是太阳能电池板和电池。 That’s my prediction.这是我的预测。 My predictions have pretty good track record.我的预测有很好的记录。 So yeah, and the power walls can also act as kind of a virtual grid.所以是的，电源墙也可以充当一种虚拟电网。 If you have thousands of power walls in a neighborhood, they can actually work in concert to stabilize the grid.如果你在一个社区里有成千上万个电源墙，它们实际上可以协同工作来稳定电网。 The V4 supercharger is pretty cool.V4超级充电站非常酷。 It enables charging at 500 kilowatts and the Semi can charge at 1.2 megawatts.它可以实现500千瓦的充电，Semi可以实现1.2兆瓦的充电。 And it’s smaller and lighter.它更小更轻。 It’s a big improvement overall.总体来说是一个很大的改进。 And we’re rolling this out worldwide.我们正在全球范围内推广它。 So it will increase charging speeds and just enable you to get your car charged really fast.所以它将提高充电速度，让你能够非常快地为你的汽车充电。 And then with regard to cell manufacturing, at this point we think we’re making the most efficient cell in the world.然后关于电池制造，在这一点上，我们认为我们正在制造世界上效率最高的电池。 Meaning like the lowest cost per kilowatt hour cell, which is really pretty good.意味着每千瓦时电池的成本最低，这真的非常好。 There are entire companies that all they do is make lithium ion battery cells.有很多公司，他们所做的就是制造锂离子电池。 And for us that’s one of many things that we do.对我们来说，这是我们所做的许多事情之一。 So congratulations to the cell team on making the best cell.所以祝贺电池团队制造出最好的电池。 So that’s a really big deal.所以这是一件非常重要的事情。 And then we’re also investing in the whole battery supply chain.然后我们还在投资整个电池供应链。 So we have cathode production, we have lithium refining, and then more.所以我们有正极生产，我们有锂提炼，然后更多。 Yeah, hopefully.是的，希望如此。 We’re sort of hoping someone else will do the anode.我们有点希望其他人来做负极。 We might have to do the anode.我们可能不得不做负极。 I hope someone else does it.我希望其他人来做。 Why do we have to do all these things?我们为什么要做到所有这些事情？ A lot of people think we do a lot of these things because we want to, but really it’s often just because we didn’t have any choice and nobody else was doing it, so we had to do it.很多人认为我们做很多这些事情是因为我们想这样做，但实际上通常只是因为我们别无选择，而且没有人这样做，所以我们不得不这样做。 So a lot of new factory milestones.所以很多新的工厂里程碑。 So in Berlin we produced 660,000 drive units.所以在柏林，我们生产了66万个驱动单元。 In Fremont we built our first Optimus at the Optimus production line in Fremont.在弗里蒙特，我们在弗里蒙特的擎天柱生产线上建造了我们的第一个擎天柱。 We were preparing for cybercap production here at Gigafactory Austin.我们正在奥斯汀超级工厂准备进行cybercap的生产。 And Gigafactory Shanghai created its 3 millionth car.上海超级工厂生产了第300万辆汽车。 We’ve produced 160,000 Naxx adapters at Gigafactory New York.我们在纽约超级工厂生产了16万个Naxx适配器。 And we’ve got record battery pack production at Gigafactory Nevada.我们在内华达超级工厂实现了创纪录的电池组生产。 So congrats to everyone.所以祝贺大家。 We also just behind us on the south side of the building we have the Tesla, we call Cortex-1.我们还在我们身后，建筑南侧，我们拥有特斯拉，我们称之为Cortex-1。 It’s basically a giant brain, computer brain, that is used for AI training.它基本上是一个巨大的大脑，电脑大脑，用于人工智能训练。 So we take the vast amounts of video that we get from all the cars in the fleet, and we use that to train the artificial intelligence to be able to drive the car.所以我们从车队中的所有汽车中获取大量视频，并使用它来训练人工智能，使其能够驾驶汽车。 And this is one of the most powerful training systems in the world with over 50,000 GPUs active and soon to be 100,000 GPUs.拥有超过50,000个活跃的GPU，很快将达到100,000个GPU，这是世界上最强大的训练系统之一。 Which will make it I think probably top five in the world in training centers.我认为这将使其成为世界训练中心的前五名。 We’re also continuing to make progress on our Dojo training supercomputer.我们还在我们的Dojo训练超级计算机上继续取得进展。 So we’ve got Dojo 1 active now in Gigafactory New York and Palo Alto.所以我们现在在纽约超级工厂和帕洛阿尔托都启动了Dojo 1。 And it is actively working.它正在积极工作。 It’s actually taking load on, it’s doing a meaningful percentage, well, I guess 5% or whatever.它实际上正在承担负载，它正在做有意义的百分比，好吧，我猜是5%或其他。 But it’s still something, 5%, maybe approaching 10% of the training load of the self-driving AI is being done by Dojo.但这仍然很重要，5%，可能接近自动驾驶人工智能的训练负载的10%是由Dojo完成的。 And then we’ve got Dojo 2 that’s coming down the line.然后我们还有即将推出的Dojo 2。 That’ll be probably 10 times better than Dojo 1.那可能会比Dojo 1好10倍。 And so it’s sort of exciting.所以这有点令人兴奋。 We’re making good progress with Dojo.我们在Dojo方面取得了良好的进展。 I’m increasingly optimistic about the future of Dojo.我对Dojo的未来越来越乐观。 I think it’s, we’ve got a real shot here at a breakthrough.我认为这是，我们在这里有真正的突破机会。 So congrats to the Dojo team.所以祝贺Dojo团队。 And all Tesla vehicles have now had what we call Autopilot Hardware 4, or really our AI 4 hardware.现在所有特斯拉汽车都配备了我们所谓的自动驾驶硬件4，或者实际上是我们的AI 4硬件。 And it’s really, it’s a very powerful AI-inferenced computer, but also operates at very low power.这确实是一个非常强大的AI推理计算机，但也以非常低的功耗运行。 And even to this day, even though this has been something we designed several years ago, there actually isn’t anything on the market that we can buy that is better than AI 4.即使到了今天，即使这是我们几年前设计的东西，实际上市场上没有任何我们可以购买的东西比AI 4更好。 So, and obviously in the future years we’ll have AI 5 and AI 6.所以，显然在未来的几年里，我们将拥有AI 5和AI 6。 Sometimes people say, “Should I wait?”有时人们会说，“我应该等待吗？” I’m like, “Well, we’re always going to have another version, so there’s no point in waiting because we’re always waiting forever.”我就像，“嗯，我们总会有另一个版本，所以没有必要等待，因为我们总是永远在等待。” So, but we obviously will have an AI 5 and an AI 6 and an AI 7, and we’ll keep improving the AI compute.所以，但我们显然会有AI 5和AI 6和AI 7，我们将继续改进AI计算。 So for those out there that are interested in developing advanced chips, come work at Tesla.所以对于那些有兴趣开发高级芯片的人，来特斯拉工作吧。 And it is always, I think, profound to watch our cars driving with no one in them.而且我认为，观看我们的汽车在没有人的情况下驾驶总是令人深刻的。 And we actually have the cars doing useful work for the first time with no one in them, which I think is really, it’s a significant milestone.我们实际上第一次让汽车在没有人的情况下做有用的工作，我认为这真的很重要，这是一个重要的里程碑。 So the cars are driving from end of line in Fremont to park themselves, and I think we’ve just started doing that here in Austin.所以汽车从弗里蒙特的生产线下线后自己开到停车位，而且我认为我们刚刚开始在奥斯汀做这件事。 So we’ll be, yeah, the car literally goes from end of line in Fremont to its destination parking spot.所以我们会，是的，汽车确实从弗里蒙特的生产线下线后开到它的目的地停车位。 Where it gets picked up by a truck for delivery to a customer, and it does that with no one in it.在那里它被卡车接走，运送给客户，而且它在没有人的情况下完成这件事。 And it’s not doing that all day every day.而且它不是每天都这样做。 Like, you know, pretty much like it’s just a matter of fact thing.就像，你知道，几乎就像这是一件理所当然的事情。 Yeah.是的。 So, let’s see.所以，让我们看看。 Yeah, and obviously for anyone that’s using it, you can see the dramatic improvements in the, in full self-driving.是的，显然对于任何正在使用它的人来说，你可以看到完全自动驾驶方面的巨大改进。 Where it’s getting to the point where interventions are extremely rare, and eventually I get to the point where there really is no need to intervene.它正在达到干预非常罕见的程度，最终我会达到真正不需要干预的程度。 Like, the car is going to be better than human.就像，汽车将比人类更好。 In fact, maybe it’s worth emphasizing that it’s not that Tesla full self-driving will be equal to humans in safety.事实上，也许值得强调的是，特斯拉完全自动驾驶在安全性方面不会等于人类。 It will be ultimately 10 times safer than a human, because it never gets tired.它最终将比人类安全10倍，因为它永远不会感到疲倦。 It doesn’t, you know, like, humans get tired and sometimes get wasted, you know.它不会，你知道，就像，人类会感到疲倦，有时会浪费时间，你知道。 And we’ll have arguments or change the radio or, you know, text.我们会争论或更换收音机或，你知道，发短信。 I know no one in this audience would ever text while driving.我知道在座的各位都不会在开车时发短信。 That would be crazy.那太疯狂了。 But, you know, it does happen.但是，你知道，它确实会发生。 So, the reality is that the Tesla full self-driving will be vastly safer than humans.所以，现实情况是特斯拉完全自动驾驶将比人类安全得多。 Not just equivalent, but actually vastly safer.不仅仅是等同，而是实际上安全得多。 And it means you can do whatever you want while driving.这意味着你可以在驾驶时做任何你想做的事情。 So, even if you don’t, like, rent your car out for usage, you can still, it frees up your time.所以，即使你不，比如，出租你的汽车供使用，你仍然可以，它释放了你的时间。 So, let’s say you’re driving 10, 12 hours a week or more, it gives you back 10 to 12 hours of your life, which is extremely cool.所以，假设你每周驾驶10到12个小时或更多，它会让你找回10到12个小时的生命，这非常酷。 So, well, Optimus sure has come a long way.所以，擎天柱确实走了很长的路。 So, the new Optimus 22 degree of freedom hand and forearm is now in production.所以，新的擎天柱22自由度手和前臂现在正在生产中。 And it’s learning to walk and catch balls.它正在学习走路和接球。 It’s pretty cool.这非常酷。 I mean, look, that’s where we came from.我的意思是，看看，那是我们来自的地方。 It’s wild.这太疯狂了。 So, in a very short period of time, Optimus has gone from being an idea to the most sophisticated humanoid robot on Earth.所以，在很短的时间内，擎天柱已经从一个想法变成了地球上最复杂的人形机器人。 There’s nothing even close to the level of sophistication of Optimus.没有什么能接近擎天柱的复杂程度。 And Tesla has some important missing ingredients that others don’t have, which is our robot has a real brain.特斯拉拥有其他公司没有的一些重要的缺失要素，那就是我们的机器人拥有一个真正的大脑。 It’s like Wizard of Oz, Tin Man.就像绿野仙踪，铁皮人。 Was that a heart or a brain?那是一个心脏还是一个大脑？ One of the two.两者之一。 So, it’s got the real world AI.所以，它拥有真实世界的人工智能。 So, Tesla’s the leader in real world AI.所以，特斯拉是真实世界人工智能的领导者。 What we learned from the car, we translate to the Optimus robot.我们从汽车中学到的东西，我们转化为擎天柱机器人。 We also take our expertise in electric motors, in batteries, power electronics, structural design.我们还运用我们在电动机、电池、电力电子、结构设计方面的专业知识。 And then another major important thing is that we’re very good at manufacturing.然后另一件主要重要的事情是，我们非常擅长制造。 So, in order for robots to be useful, they have to be intelligent.所以，为了使机器人有用，它们必须是智能的。 They have to be able to do useful things just by asking.它们必须能够通过询问来做有用的事情。 And you have to be able to make a large number of them at an affordable price.你必须能够以合理的价格制造大量它们。 This is what we can do.这就是我们能做的事情。 The only company with all the ingredients for making intelligent humanoid robots at scale is Tesla.唯一一家拥有大规模制造智能人形机器人的所有要素的公司是特斯拉。 This is a super big deal.这是一件非常重要的事情。 My prediction on this front is that Optimus will be the biggest product of all time by far.我对这方面的预测是，擎天柱将成为有史以来最大的产品。 Nothing will even be close.没有什么可以接近它。 I think it will be 10 times bigger than the next biggest product ever made.我认为它将比有史以来第二大的产品大10倍。 Like that level.就像那个级别。 All right.好的。 So, with that, anybody have any questions?所以，有了这些，有人有任何问题吗？ Congratulations.恭喜。 Thank you.谢谢。 Cool.酷。 And we rocket castings.我们进行火箭铸造。 We do.我们是的。 Well, we do want to scale up production to new heights.嗯，我们确实想将生产扩大到新的高度。 Obviously, with the CyberCab, we’re going to be.显然，有了CyberCab，我们将会这样做。 The CyberCab is not just revolutionary car design, it’s also a revolutionary manufacturing process.CyberCab不仅仅是革命性的汽车设计，也是一个革命性的制造过程。 So, I guess we probably don’t talk about that enough.所以，我想我们可能没有足够地谈论这个。 But if you’ve seen the design of the CyberCab line, it doesn’t look like a normal car manufacturing line.但是如果你看过CyberCab生产线的设计，它看起来不像普通的汽车生产线。 It looks like a really high speed consumer electronics line.它看起来像一条非常高速的消费电子产品线。 In fact, the line will move so fast that actually people can’t even get close to it.事实上，这条生产线移动得如此之快，以至于实际上人们甚至无法靠近它。 Like that’s. I think it’ll be able to produce a car ultimately in less than five seconds.就像那样。我认为它最终能够在大约不到五秒钟的时间内生产一辆汽车。 Can you imagine a car coming off the line in less than five seconds?你能想象一辆汽车在不到五秒钟的时间内下线吗？ That’s like, whoa.就像，哇。 Which means casting’s got to happen fast.这意味着铸造必须快速进行。 Yeah, yeah.是的，是的。 We’ve got to jam the liquid metal in, cool it down real fast, real fast.我们必须将液态金属注入，并以非常快的速度冷却它。 And then, I guess maybe we need to just get even bigger casting machines?然后，我想也许我们只需要获得更大的铸造机？ Sure, why not?当然，为什么不呢？ Down, yeah, let’s. 50,000 tons.好，是的，让我们。50,000吨。 Because then we can make, in a single casting machine, we could do five at a time or something.因为这样我们就可以在一台铸造机中一次做五个或其他。 I’m trying to think, how do you scale castings?我正在想，你如何扩大铸造规模？ Because you’ve got liquid metal, metal’s got to cool.因为你有液态金属，金属必须冷却。 And then you’ve got automate, getting all the bits and pieces off the casting so it’s usable.然后你必须自动化，将铸件上的所有碎片都移除，使其可用。 And that’s actually kind of how they do it in small volume castings.这实际上是他们如何在小批量铸造中做到这一点。 They’ll have a casting block that’ll make 100 Matchbox cars at a time.他们将有一个铸造块，一次可以制作100辆火柴盒汽车。 Maybe we’ll just make that real big.也许我们只是把它做大。 I mean, we have the Cathedral of Casting back there.我的意思是，我们后面有铸造大教堂。 So, yeah, let’s do that.所以，是的，让我们这样做。 I mean, let’s see, what is the limit of physics of how big can a casting machine be?我的意思是，让我们看看，物理学对铸造机的尺寸限制是什么？ Let’s find out.让我们找出答案。 I’m down.我愿意。 Let’s have some fun here.让我们在这里玩得开心。 Limits of technology.技术的限制。 All right.好的。 Hi, Elon.你好，埃隆。 I’ve been with Tesla for the last eight years.我已经在特斯拉工作了八年。 It has been the most exhilarating eight years of my career.这是我职业生涯中最令人振奋的八年。 And truly want to thank you for your leadership.而且我真心感谢你的领导。 I also have two little, Thank you for your contribution.我也有两个小，感谢您的贡献。 Thank you.谢谢。 Thank you for your leadership.感谢您的领导。 I also have two little girls who spend their weekends cruising around in their very awesome Cybertruck.我也有两个小女孩，她们在周末驾驶着她们非常棒的Cybertruck四处游玩。 I’d love to know when we can add Optimus to the family.我很想知道我们什么时候可以把擎天柱加入到家庭中。 Oh, yeah, that’s a good question.哦，是的，这是一个好问题。 So this year we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots.所以今年我们有望能够制造大约5,000个擎天柱机器人。 Technically, we’re aiming for enough parts to make 10,000, maybe 12,000.从技术上讲，我们的目标是有足够的零件来制造10,000个，甚至12,000个。 But since it’s a totally new product with totally new, like everything is totally new, I’ll say like we’re succeeding if we get to half of the 10,000.但由于这是一个全新的产品，拥有全新的，就像一切都是全新的，我会说，如果我们能达到10,000个的一半，我们就成功了。 But even 5,000 robots, that’s the size of a Roman legion, FYI.但即使是5,000个机器人，也相当于一个罗马军团的规模，仅供参考。 Which is like a little scary thought, like a whole legion of robots.这有点可怕的想法，就像一个完整的机器人军团。 I’d be like, whoa.我会想，哇。 But I think we’ll literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year.但我认为我们今年将真正建造一个军团，至少一个机器人军团。 And then probably 10 legions next year.然后明年可能会有10个军团。 That’s kind of a cool unit, you know.这是一种很酷的单位，你知道。 Units of legion.军团单位。 So probably 50,000-ish next year.所以明年可能大约有50,000个。 And then it’s probably ready for, I’m hopefully ready for Optimus to be used outside of Tesla-controlled environment.然后它可能已经准备好了，我希望已经准备好擎天柱在特斯拉控制环境之外使用。 Maybe around the middle of next year, second half of next year sometime.可能在明年年中左右，明年下半年某个时候。 So I think that sounds about right.所以我认为这听起来差不多。 Probably second half of next year is when they’ll be available.可能在明年下半年它们就可以使用了。 And then we will offer Optimus robots first to Tesla employees.然后我们将首先向特斯拉员工提供擎天柱机器人。 So you guys get priority.所以你们优先。 There are some pluses and minuses to that, you know.你知道，这有一些优点和缺点。 Because it’s, probably have a few bugs, but it’s going to be very cool.因为，可能有一些错误，但它会非常酷。 You’ll definitely want to invite your friends over and say, check this out.你肯定会想邀请你的朋友过来，然后说，看看这个。 So that’s the other questions.所以这是其他问题。 Hi, Elon.你好，埃隆。 Hey.嘿。 My name’s Dom.我叫多姆。 I’ve been here for a little over a year now.我在这里工作了一年多。 I work in people development.我从事人员发展工作。 We try to, we make so many amazing things.我们试图，我们制造了很多令人惊叹的东西。 Right now it’s still the people that do it.现在仍然是人们在做这件事。 Yes.是的。 When we think about applying first principles to the relationships and the teams that people have.当我们考虑将第一性原理应用于人际关系和团队时。 How would you encourage us to think about that and act on those first principles when it comes to relationships and teams?你将如何鼓励我们思考这个问题，并在人际关系和团队方面按照这些第一性原理行事？ Hmm.嗯。 Well, I think, you know, there are actually quite a few things I’ve written over the years that it would be good to compile into like a booklet or something.嗯，我认为，你知道，实际上我多年来写了很多东西，最好将它们整理成一本小册子之类的东西。 Because I actually have to be reminded of those things myself.因为实际上我必须自己记住这些事情。 And I’m like, oh, I remember that thing that I thought of after making so many mistakes and trying to make fewer mistakes.我就像，哦，我记得在犯了这么多错误并试图减少错误之后，我想到的那件事。 So, you know, there’s like, for example, a five-step process of like make the requirements less dumb and then try to delete the part and process step.所以，你知道，例如，有一个五步过程，比如让需求不那么愚蠢，然后尝试删除零件和过程步骤。 Only then optimize, only then speed it up, and only the fifth thing is automate.只有这样才能优化，只有这样才能加速，只有第五件事是自动化。 I have to repeat that to myself many times because I’ve made the mistake of doing it backwards so many times.我必须多次对自己重复这一点，因为我犯了很多次倒着做的错误。 And, you know, I think always operating on the principle that everyone is wrong to some degree and we should aspire to be less wrong over time.而且，你知道，我认为始终按照每个人在某种程度上都是错误的原则运作，我们应该渴望随着时间的推移变得不那么错误。 Which we will not always succeed in doing.我们不会总是成功做到这一点。 But if, you know, if two days out of three you’re less wrong over time, you’re going to be, your batting average is going to be really good.但是，你知道，如果三天中有两天你随着时间的推移变得不那么错误，你就会，你的击球率会非常好。 So nobody ever bats a thousand, but you can improve your batting average.所以没有人能达到1000分，但你可以提高你的击球率。 So I think rigorous, you know, you want to critique yourself, you want to internalize responsibility.所以我认为严格的，你知道，你想批评自己，你想内化责任。 And these are all things I need to remind myself of, you know, just to be clear.而且这些都是我需要提醒自己的事情，你知道，为了清楚起见。 I don’t want to like suggesting I, internalize responsibility.我不希望像建议我，内化责任。 Be less wrong.少犯错误。 And we should remember what is our goal as a company.我们应该记住我们作为公司的目标是什么。 Our goal is to make amazing products that people love and then to take care of those products and service.我们的目标是制造人们喜爱的惊人产品，然后照顾这些产品和服务。 So we should say what are we doing to make our products better, to make them affordable, to have the customer experience be delightful.所以我们应该说我们正在做什么来使我们的产品更好，使它们负担得起，使客户体验令人愉快。 Because that’s actually the purpose of a company.因为这实际上是公司的目的。 Sometimes people get why does a company exist?有时人们会想，公司为什么存在？ A company exists, it’s a group of people collected together to produce a compelling product or service that others find useful.公司的存在，是一群人聚集在一起，生产出引人注目的产品或服务，其他人觉得有用。 And where the value of the product and service is greater than the cost of what it took to make that product or service.而且产品和服务的价值大于制造该产品或服务所需的成本。 So sometimes weirdly profit is viewed negatively.所以有时奇怪的是，利润被负面看待。 But really profit is just the difference in value between the output and the input.但实际上利润只是产出和投入之间的价值差异。 It’s like what did it cost you to make it and what did it cost you, and what are people prepared to pay for it?就像你制造它花了多少钱，它花了你多少钱，以及人们准备为此付出多少钱？ That’s the value that you created.那是你创造的价值。 So it’s tough actually even to maintain like a 10% profitability, which is to make the output 10% more valuable than the input.所以实际上即使要保持像10%的盈利能力也很困难，即要使产出比投入更有价值10%。 It’s actually quite hard, especially in the car industry, which is very competitive.这实际上非常困难，尤其是在竞争激烈的汽车行业。 So we should just not lose sight of like why are we here?所以我们不应该忘记我们为什么在这里？ We’re here to make useful products that people love and take care of them over time.我们在这里制造人们喜爱的有用产品，并随着时间的推移照顾它们。 So then how are we doing in that respect and how can we do that better?所以我们在这方面做得怎么样？我们如何才能做得更好？ Sure.当然。 What advice would you give a young person like getting into the stock market?你会给一个刚进入股市的年轻人什么建议？ Oh, stock advice.哦，股票建议。 Wow.哇。 Yes, sir.是的，先生。 As I think people can perhaps tell who are watching this, these questions are not prepared in advance.我认为人们可以告诉那些正在观看的人，这些问题不是事先准备好的。 This is literally random questions from the crowd, which is cool.这确实是来自人群的随机问题，这很酷。 I actually am fine with that.我实际上对此很好。 And I think that it’s going to sound very straightforward.我认为这听起来会非常简单。 But you want to really buy stock in companies where you think the products that that company makes will be better in the future.但是你真的想购买那些你认为该公司制造的产品将来会更好的公司的股票。 Like is that company going to make more and better products?就像该公司会制造更多更好的产品吗？ Or like do you love the products that that company makes and are they going to keep doing that?或者你喜欢该公司制造的产品，他们会继续这样做吗？ And like I think Tesla, as I’ve just gone through, Tesla has a track record of having made many great products.而且我认为特斯拉，就像我刚才经历的那样，特斯拉有制造许多伟大产品的记录。 And we’re going to make many more future great products and we’re going to scale up production.我们将制造更多未来的伟大产品，我们将扩大生产。 And I think we’ve demonstrated a level of innovation that is extremely rare.我认为我们已经展示了极其罕见的创新水平。 I mean, certainly by far the most innovative company in the car industry, like not even close type of thing.我的意思是，当然是迄今为止汽车行业最具创新性的公司，根本没有可比性。 So, you know, I do think Tesla stock actually long I think long term with with Optimus and self driving Tesla will probably be the most valuable company in the world.所以，你知道，我确实认为特斯拉股票实际上长期来看，我认为长期来看，随着擎天柱和自动驾驶，特斯拉可能会成为世界上最有价值的公司。 But there are also other companies out there that make great products and services.但是也有其他公司制造出色的产品和服务。 So I think that’s the way you want to look at it.所以我认为这就是你想看待它的方式。 Say like, do you think this product because that’s the reason why companies exist is to make great products and services.说，你认为这个产品，因为这就是公司存在的原因是制造出色的产品和服务。 So if you think that the company is going to improve over time, then buy the stock and if you don’t, then don’t.所以如果你认为公司会随着时间的推移而进步，那就购买股票，如果你不这么认为，那就不要购买。 And then the stock market is it’s a very strange thing.然后股市是一个非常奇怪的东西。 It’s kind of like, you know, I think it was Warren Buffett sort of metaphor analogy is.这有点像，你知道，我认为这是沃伦·巴菲特的一种隐喻类比。 You know, stock markets like having someone stand at the edge of your property or your house and yell prices to buy or sell your house every day.你知道，股市就像有人每天站在你的财产或你房子的边缘，喊叫买卖你的房子的价格。 And like sometimes they take their meds and sometimes they don’t, you know.就像有时他们吃药，有时他们不吃药，你知道。 So sometimes the person yelling the price of your house is having a good day or sometimes having a bad day.所以有时喊叫你房子价格的人心情很好，有时心情不好。 But it’s still the same house.但它仍然是同一栋房子。 You’re like, I’m like literally still the same house.你会想，我实际上仍然是同一栋房子。 Like, you know, so Tesla stock goes up and it goes down.就像，你知道，所以特斯拉股票上涨和下跌。 But actually it’s still the same company.但实际上它仍然是同一家公司。 It’s just people’s perception of the future.这只是人们对未来的看法。 I don’t know.我不知道。 I guess it’s just very emotional, you know.我猜这只是非常情绪化的，你知道。 So but for me, like while it’s difficult to predict how things will be from.所以但对我来说，虽然很难预测事情会如何发展。 You know, in the next six to 12 months, if you say like where will things be in three years or five years, the future of Tesla is incredibly bright.你知道，在接下来的六到十二个月里，如果你说三年或五年后会是什么样子，特斯拉的未来将非常光明。 Hello, Eli.你好，埃莱。 I’m Hi.我是嗨。 Yes.是的。 You say will the robot take your job or what?你说机器人会抢走你的工作吗？ That’s a fair question.这是一个公平的问题。 So yeah, like is the robot going to come steal your job?所以是的，机器人会来抢走你的工作吗？ A reasonable question.一个合理的问题。 I think what we’ll find with the robots is that there will be a ratio of people to robots.我认为我们将会发现，机器人会与人形成一种比例。 So you’ll effectively end up having managing a group of robots.所以你最终会有效地管理一组机器人。 So you know, you’ll have like basically, I don’t know, your flock or your little group of robots that you take care of and you tell them what to do.所以你知道，你会像基本上，我不知道，你的羊群或你的小群机器人，你照顾它们并告诉它们做什么。 And I don’t know, you’ll have a pack of robots basically.而且我不知道，你基本上会有一群机器人。 Yeah, you’re promoted to manager.是的，你被提升为经理。 One way to think of it.一种思考方式。 I think the same thing will be true of cars.我认为汽车也会如此。 Like for the self-driving cars is that people that are say Uber drivers today or something like that or taxi drivers today will end up managing a fleet of cars.就像对于自动驾驶汽车来说，比如今天优步司机或者出租车司机之类的人最终会管理一支车队。 And that will be a much more effective use of their time.这将更加有效地利用他们的时间。 You know, just taking care of like 10, 20 cars or however many they can take care of.你知道，只是照顾像10辆，20辆汽车或他们能照顾的任何数量的汽车。 So yeah.所以是的。 Hello, my name is Adrian.你好，我叫阿德里安。 You said that your companies are made to make products people love.你说你的公司是为了制造人们喜爱的产品而设立的。 Yeah.是的。 Have you ever thought of airplanes or trains?你有没有想过飞机或火车？ Yeah, I mean, I’d actually love to make airplanes especially, but I’m stretched pretty thin.是的，我的意思是，我实际上很想制造飞机，但我已经分身乏术了。 So I have like 17 jobs.所以我身兼17职。 At this point I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, and then do that seven days a week pretty much.在这一点上，我只是睡觉，工作，睡觉，然后每周七天都这样做。 People say like where do you go on vacation?人们会说，比如你去哪里度假？ I’m like what’s that?我就像那是什么？ You know.你知道。 But I guess I like being productive.但我猜我喜欢有生产力。 I like getting things done.我喜欢把事情做完。 So I guess I could choose to be like on an island somewhere, sipping a Mai Tai, you know, with attractive people in bikinis and stuff.所以我猜我可以选择在某个岛屿上，啜饮一杯Mai Tai，你知道，和穿着比基尼的有魅力的人在一起。 Wait, why am I not doing that?等等，我为什么不这样做？ What?什么？ What a fool I’ve been.我真是个傻瓜。 So yeah.所以是的。 I’ve actually thought about aircraft designs for a long time.实际上我已经考虑飞机设计很长时间了。 And I think there’s an interesting opportunity to make like an electric supersonic VTOL jet.我认为有一个有趣的机会来制造像电动超音速VTOL喷气机。 You know, the VTOL is like cherry on the cake, but certainly electric, long range fast electric airplane would be very cool.你知道，VTOL就像锦上添花，但当然电动，远程快速电动飞机会非常酷。 You know, maybe at some point we’ll do that.你知道，也许在某个时候我们会这样做。 Yeah, that would be kind of fun.是的，这会很有趣。 But we do have the ingredients for it.但我们确实拥有制造它的要素。 So.所以。 And then there is the potential for, yeah, we’re like thinking like pretty far into the future here of not a conventional train, but that sort of hyperloop.然后有潜力，是的，我们正在考虑非常遥远的未来，不是传统的火车，而是那种超级高铁。 Essentially vacuum tunnels, like tunnels where you draw a vacuum so there’s no air resistance.基本上是真空隧道，就像你在隧道里抽真空一样，这样就没有空气阻力。 And you have very high speed, autonomous electric pods in a vacuum tube, vacuum tunnel.而且你在真空管，真空隧道里有非常高速，自主的电动舱。 That would allow you to go from city center to city center much faster than any airplane could possibly go.这将使你从市中心到市中心的速度比任何飞机都快得多。 Because going into the into the underground vacuum tunnel would be like teleporting to super high altitude effectively, which no plane could do.因为进入地下真空隧道就像有效地传送到超高海拔，这是任何飞机都做不到的。 And then it could deliver you right to the center of a city.然后它可以将你送到一个城市的中心。 And that I don’t know, maybe that’s some future collaboration with the Boeing company and Tesla.而且我不知道，也许这是未来与波音公司和特斯拉的合作。 I got a million ideas.我有一百万个想法。 The ideas are I have more ideas than I know what to do with.我的想法比我知道如何处理的还要多。 Ideas are kind of the easy part.想法是比较容易的部分。 Execution is the hard part.执行是困难的部分。 As they say, it’s one percent inspiration, 99 percent post-proporation.正如他们所说，这是百分之一的灵感，百分之九十九的事后努力。 Work in manufacturing engineering.从事制造工程工作。 Since 2018, I’ve done a bunch of different things here, kind of like energy products, Model 3, Model Y, cyber.自2018年以来，我在这里做了很多不同的事情，有点像能源产品，Model 3，Model Y，cyber。 And now we’re looking forward to Optimus, maybe the biggest product ever.现在我们期待着擎天柱，也许是有史以来最大的产品。 Yeah, it will be.是的，会的。 And I think about the mission statement of the company and its evolved.我想到了公司的使命宣言及其演变。 It used to be a sustainable transportation, then sustainable energy.它曾经是可持续交通，然后是可持续能源。 Is it going to evolve again?它会再次发展吗？ Are we going to reformulate that officially to kind of explain to the world better about how Optimus and AI folds into the rest of the fabric of the company?我们将正式重新制定它，以更好地向世界解释擎天柱和人工智能如何融入公司的其他结构中吗？ Yeah, I mean, I touched on this briefly earlier, but you’re right that I think we do need to articulate it more prominently.是的，我的意思是，我之前简要地提到了这一点，但你是对的，我认为我们确实需要更突出地表达它。 And maybe more often because it’s really about sustainable abundance.也许更频繁地表达它，因为它实际上是关于可持续的丰盈。 Can we have a future of abundance for all that is also sustainable and compatible with nature?我们能拥有一个为所有人带来丰盈的未来，同时又是可持续的并且与自然兼容吗？ So we’re not destroying nature, but you also get abundance for everyone on Earth.所以我们没有破坏自然，但你也为地球上的每个人获得了丰盈。 Sounds like the best possible future.听起来是最好的未来。 That’s what we’re trying to do.这就是我们试图做的。 Yeah.是的。 Yes, sir, my name is Aaron Armstrong.是的，先生，我叫艾伦·阿姆斯特朗。 Yes, sir, my name is Aaron Armstrong.是的，先生，我叫艾伦·阿姆斯特朗。 It’s not every day that you get to be in the presence of somebody that’s accumulated so much wealth and success.你不是每天都有机会与积累了如此多财富和成功的人在一起。 So I just wanted to take this opportunity to ask for any wisdoms or secrets that you may have to offer about this game of life that we’re all trying to play.所以我想借此机会询问你可能拥有的关于我们都在试图玩的游戏人生的任何智慧或秘密。 Sure.当然。 I mean, I try to say everything that I know.我的意思是，我尽量说出我所知道的一切。 Well, admittedly, sometimes I’m, you know, like I posted on X.嗯，不得不承认，有时我是，你知道，就像我在X上发布的。 I guess I should ask the AI to look through all of my X posts and pick out the ones that are really good because I try to say any good ideas that I have.我想我应该要求人工智能查看我所有的X帖子，并挑选出真正好的帖子，因为我尽量说出我拥有的任何好主意。 I try to post them.我尽量发布它们。 Yeah, I think generally it’s good to always be curious and to, you know, to read widely.是的，我认为通常来说，始终保持好奇心并且，你知道，广泛阅读是件好事。 Like, you know, read a lot of interesting books, especially history.就像，你知道，阅读很多有趣的书籍，尤其是历史。 I find history really interesting.我发现历史真的很有趣。 And I find like biographies and autobiographies to be also very interesting.我发现像传记和自传也很有趣。 You know, I think it’s good to read especially autobiographies where like, you know, somebody’s done something incredible and they wrote the book themselves or mostly themselves.你知道，我认为阅读自传尤其有好处，因为，你知道，有人做了一些令人难以置信的事情，他们自己或大部分时间自己写了这本书。 That’ll give you a lot of ideas.那会给你很多想法。 And I mean, something that I do is I’ll get audio books because I got like so much going on in my mind when it’s kind of hard to go to sleep.我的意思是，我做的一件事是我会买有声读物，因为我的脑子里有很多事情，很难入睡。 Because it’s like having a computer browser with like 100 tabs open.因为它就像有一个打开了100个标签的计算机浏览器。 By the end of the day, I got like 100 tabs open.到一天结束时，我就像打开了100个标签。 It’s like I got to close this browser, you know.就像我必须关闭这个浏览器，你知道。 That’s my brain.那是我的大脑。 So then I’ll listen to an audio book and I’ll put it on a timer and it’s like 15 minutes.所以我会听一本有声读物，我会把它放在一个计时器上，它是15分钟。 It’s like being read a bedtime story by your phone.就像你的手机在给你读睡前故事。 So podcasts and audio books, especially at bedtime, I find are great.所以播客和有声读物，尤其是在睡前，我认为很棒。 Or yeah, sure.或者，是的，当然。 Sorry, I can’t hear you.对不起，我听不见你。 Oh, there’s a city in South Texas which is Starbase.哦，南德克萨斯州有一座城市，叫做星舰基地。 So it’s a city for, it’s, cities maybe makes it sound bigger than it is.所以这是一座城市，城市这个词可能使它听起来比实际更大。 But it is, it’s a really a small town plus a giant rocket factory.但它确实是，它实际上是一个小镇加上一个巨大的火箭工厂。 That’s Starbase.那是星舰基地。 And it’s South Texas and Starbase, Texas, right by the Rio Grande.它位于南德克萨斯州，德克萨斯州星舰基地，就在格兰德河旁边。 And you can just literally drive there because it’s on like a state highway.你可以直接开车去那里，因为它在一条州际公路上。 So you can just drive through it, check it out.所以你可以开车穿过它，看看它。 So I do own a piece of property that’s just across the river.我确实拥有一块就在河对面的土地。 That’s kind of cool.这有点酷。 It used to be like a horse place, like where they would give horse riding lessons and stuff.它曾经是一个养马的地方，他们会提供骑马课程之类的。 And at some point I think it would be cool to, I want to do like this gigantic art project there.在某个时候我认为如果能，我想在那里做一个巨大的艺术项目会很酷。 That’s like a, looks like an alien planet, like right across the river.就像一个看起来像外星行星的东西，就在河对面。 But like that people could visit, you know.但人们可以参观，你知道。 So then I might like live there occasionally.所以然后我可能会偶尔住在那里。 But really it’s a place to, like I don’t know, to envision sort of an alien planet art project across the river.但实际上这是一个，我不知道，设想在河对岸做一个外星行星艺术项目的地方。 They’re kind of cool.它们有点酷。 Yeah.是的。 Yeah.是的。 Do we foresee Tesla making a product that helps how we spend money?我们是否预见到特斯拉会制造一种产品来帮助我们如何花钱？ Well, I think the AI is going to help us spend money better.嗯，我认为人工智能将帮助我们更好地花钱。 It’s kind of amazing, you know, what AI can do these days.这有点令人惊叹，你知道，现在人工智能能做什么。 I don’t know if anyone here has used Grok, but it’s pretty cool.我不知道这里是否有人使用过Grok，但它非常酷。 Grok voice can be really pretty great too.Grok语音也可以非常好。 Try Grok unhinged.试试Grok unhinged。 It’s like, it’s guaranteed to be entertaining at a party.就像，保证它在聚会上会很有趣。 I 1000% promise you if you try Grok voice unhinged at a party, this will be a very, it’s going to be a big

it’s really pretty cool.就像，它真的非常酷。 Yeah, sure.是的，当然。 Yeah, so we’re in phase three of the master plan since master plan one and two have been completed.是的，所以自从总体规划一和二完成以来，我们现在处于总体规划的第三阶段。 Now, master plan part three is a very long master plan because it’s basically making all energy on Earth sustainable.现在，总体规划第三部分是一个非常长的总体规划，因为它基本上是使地球上的所有能源都可持续。 And I actually need to supplement it with the sort of abundance for all.而且我实际上需要用为所有人提供丰盈来补充它。 Maybe that’s master plan four.也许那是总体规划四。 I’ve kind of described master plan four essentially, which is like autonomous cars, autonomous humanoid robots.我基本上已经描述了总体规划四，就像自动驾驶汽车，自主人形机器人。 You combine that with like solar and battery storage and I think the future is going to be incredible.你将它与太阳能和电池存储结合起来，我认为未来将是不可思议的。 So I’ll take a couple more questions and call it a night.所以我再回答几个问题就结束了。 Well, if you haven’t asked a question before, you can ask a question.嗯，如果你之前没有问过问题，你可以问一个问题。 Well, there are actually some autonomous robots being built in Fremont right now.嗯，现在实际上在弗里蒙特正在建造一些自主机器人。 So, I’m not sure what that was.所以，我不确定那是什么。 So we expect to have an autonomous production line here as well.所以我们也期望在这里拥有一条自主生产线。 So there will be autonomous production starting in the Bay Area and then we’ll have the even bigger autonomous production line here in Austin.所以将从湾区开始自主生产，然后我们将在奥斯汀拥有更大的自主生产线。 Yeah, there’s going to be a lot of robots.是的，将会有很多机器人。 Ultimately, I mean, I think there will be, we’ll be making tens of millions of robots a year type of thing.最终，我的意思是，我认为将会有，我们将每年制造数千万个机器人。 It’s like serious volume.就像巨大的数量。 Maybe 100 million robots a year.也许每年1亿个机器人。 It’s wild.这太疯狂了。 Yeah.是的。 All right.好的。 Well, last question.嗯，最后一个问题。 Okay.好的。 It’s about sustainability.这是关于可持续性的。 Abundance, yes.丰盈，是的。 Well, yes.嗯，是的。 I mean, obviously, utopia could be dystopia.我的意思是，显然，乌托邦可能是反乌托邦。 So we have to, like usually any story about utopia ends up being dystopia.所以我们必须，就像通常任何关于乌托邦的故事最终都会变成反乌托邦。 We want to avoid that.我们想避免这种情况。 But nonetheless, I think if you say what future, what’s the best future you can think of?但尽管如此，我认为如果你说什么样的未来，你能想到的最好的未来是什么？ I think a future of sustainable abundance plus space travel, that’s pretty great.我认为一个可持续丰盈加上太空旅行的未来，那非常棒。 Yeah.是的。 Oh, we need adversity.哦，我们需要逆境。 Well, I mean, you make a good point.嗯，我的意思是，你说得对。 Like if things actually get too easy, maybe we get bored and we’re not, you kind of want to, to some degree, overcome adversity.就像如果事情实际上变得太容易，也许我们会感到无聊，我们不，你在某种程度上想克服逆境。 You know, it’s like if you play a game of some kind, you want the game to be not too easy and not too hard.你知道，就像如果你玩某种游戏，你希望游戏不要太容易，也不要太难。 And maybe the future will be too easy, potentially, is what you’re saying.也许未来会太容易，你可能想说的是。 Yeah, it’s a high-class problem, you know.是的，这是一个高阶问题，你知道。 But I think we’ll still have human-to-human competitions.但我认为我们仍然会有人与人之间的竞争。 I mean, if you look at, say, athletics or even mind games like chess, although computers can beat any human at chess, chess is actually at an all-time high in popularity.我的意思是，如果你看看，比如说，田径运动，甚至是像国际象棋这样的智力游戏，尽管计算机可以在国际象棋方面击败任何人，但国际象棋实际上正处于有史以来最高的受欢迎程度。 And although, you know, cars can go faster than any humans, we still have athletic sports where humans compete against each other.尽管，你知道，汽车可以比任何人跑得更快，我们仍然有体育运动，人类互相竞争。 So I think we’ll still have human versus human competitiveness.所以我认为我们仍然会有人与人之间的竞争。 I think long-term we’ll also have enhancement of humans or optionally if somebody wants to enhance, like have like cybernetic enhancements like with Neuralink.我认为长期来看，我们也会有对人类的增强，或者如果有人想增强，比如像Neuralink那样的控制论增强。 You know, if you want to go cybernetic and, I don’t know, maybe have like superintelligence and be able to see.你知道，如果你想变成控制论，而且，我不知道，也许拥有超级智能并且能够看到。 You know, in different wavelengths, we could absolutely provide superhuman abilities via Neuralink in the future.你知道，在不同的波长中，我们将来绝对可以通过Neuralink提供超人的能力。 So one thing’s for sure, the future is going to be very interesting.所以有一件事是肯定的，未来将会非常有趣。 In fact, I think the most, generally I find that the most interesting outcome is the most likely.事实上，我认为最，通常我发现最有趣的结果是最有可能的结果。 Or to say it another way, maybe the most entertaining outcome, especially if ironic, is the most likely.或者换句话说，也许最有趣的结果，尤其是如果具有讽刺意味，是最有可能的结果。 It’s almost like we’re in an alien Netflix series that’s trying to have the highest possible ratings.这几乎就像我们正在观看一个外星Netflix系列剧，该系列剧试图获得尽可能高的收视率。 And like if you think about it, like that’s kind of what happens, you know, which it doesn’t mean it’s always good.就像如果你想想，就像这就是发生的事情，你知道，但这并不意味着它总是好的。 Because to your point, you wouldn’t really want to watch a show where things are great and stay great.因为正如你所说，你并不真的想观看一个事物美好并且保持美好的节目。 I’m like, oh, that’s boring.我会想，哦，那很无聊。 You want to watch a show where there’s like a narrative arc where things go up and they go down, they go back up again.你想观看一个节目，其中有一个叙事弧，事物上升，然后下降，然后再次上升。 And you don’t know exactly what’s going to happen next.你不知道接下来会发生什么。 And I think we might be in an alien Netflix series here.我认为我们可能正在观看一个外星Netflix系列剧。 So we’re just going to keep the ratings up so we don’t get canceled.所以我们将保持收视率，这样我们就不会被取消。 All right.好的。 Thank you, guys.谢谢你们，伙计们。 Thank you.谢谢。 Thank you.谢谢。 Thank you.谢谢。 Thank you.谢谢。","tags":["0008_DailyNews"],"categories":["0008_DailyNews"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】健康饮食总是很昂贵吗？","path":"/2025/03/20/wechat-2025-03-20/","content":"【英文脚本】PippaHello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Pippa. GeorgieAnd I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop? PippaI think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie? GeorgieI’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks. PippaOh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650 GeorgieThe most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650. PippaWell, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping. GeorgieBut BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something. PippaThe founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet. Alicia WestonPeople in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK. GeorgieAlicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time. Alicia WestonSo ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home. PippaAlicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened. GeorgieAlicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice. PippaTo give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats. Amy, mentorRemember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted] AllyLove this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy. GeorgiaI’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it. AllyI’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time. GeorgieThe mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic. PippaAmy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do. GeorgieOne of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy! PippaBags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world. GeorgieYes, I said a meal was €2,650. PippaWell, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive. GeorgieIt definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something. PippaWe can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events. GeorgieIf you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution. PippaIf we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality. GeorgieIf something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do. PippaAnd if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting! GeorgieOh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website. Visit bbclearningenglish.com. PippaBye for now. GeorgieBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Pippa(皮帕)I’m Pippa.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Pippa。 Georgie(乔治)And I’m Georgie. In this programme, we’re talking about saving money on food. Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?我是 Georgie。在这个计划中，我们谈论的是节省食物费用。Pippa，你擅长在食品店省钱吗？ Pippa(皮帕)I think I’m quite good. I plan what I like to cook so I don’t waste money in the supermarket. How about you, Georgie?我觉得我挺好的。我计划我喜欢做什么，这样我就不会在超市浪费钱。你呢，Georgie？ Georgie(乔治)I’m not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I’m hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.我不是很好。我通常在饿的时候去超市，所以我最终买了很多零食。 Pippa(皮帕)Oh, that’s a terrible idea. Well, in this programme we’ll be learning about one way to save money on the food we eat. But first, I’ve got a question for you, Georgie. The most expensive restaurant in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant? a) €650 b) €1,650 c) €2,650哦，这真是个糟糕的主意。好吧，在这个计划中，我们将学习一种在我们吃的食物上省钱的方法。但首先，我有一个问题要问你，Georgie。世界上最昂贵的餐厅被认为是伊维萨岛一家名为 Sublimotion 的餐厅，每晚只有 12 名顾客。但是，在餐厅每人吃一顿饭要多少欧元呢？a） 650 欧元 b） 1,650 欧元 c） 2,650 欧元 Georgie(乔治)The most expensive… I’ll go with c) €2,650.最昂贵的…我选择 c） 2,650 欧元。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting more expensive, as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to afford their food shopping.好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，英国的食品越来越贵，就像在世界许多地方一样，有些人正在努力负担食品购物的费用。 Georgie(乔治)But BBC World Service programme, People Fixing the World, has been finding out about a project called ‘Bags of Taste’ which helps people save money on their food shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say a lot of something.但 BBC 世界服务节目 People Fixing the World 一直在了解一个名为“Bags of Taste”的项目，该项目帮助人们节省购买食品的费用，同时改善他们的饮食。Bags of something 是一种非正式的方式，可以表达很多东西。 Pippa(皮帕)The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet.Bags of Taste 的创始人 Alicia Weston 开始担心，在英国，钱少的人发现很难负担得起健康的饮食。 Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)People in poverty are eating the worst diets and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK.贫困人口的饮食习惯最差，而且他们的年龄越来越大。我们知道，饮食是英国健康不平等的最大原因。 Georgie(乔治)Alicia found that people didn’t know how to cook the kinds of meals they’d like to eat, and they couldn’t afford to experiment. Imagine spending lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food. People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.Alicia 发现人们不知道如何烹饪他们想吃的饭菜，而且他们负担不起实验的费用。想象一下，在食材上花了很多钱，然后通过煮得不好或烧焦食物来浪费它们。人们还认为制作健康食品太昂贵且花费太多时间。 Alicia Weston(艾丽西亚·韦斯顿)So ultimately, we’ve been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of these issues. So what we do now is we deliver all of the ingredients to their door, because ultimately, behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.因此，最终，我们能够提出一个基本上可以解决所有这些问题的计划。所以我们现在做的是将所有原料送到他们家门口，因为归根结底，行为改变始于真正改变你在家里的行为。 Pippa(皮帕)Alicia says that ultimately, she’s been able to come up with a solution to help people save money on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally, after a series of events have happened.Alicia 说，最终，她已经能够想出一个解决方案来帮助人们在健康食品上省钱。我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally，在一系列事件发生之后。 Georgie(乔治)Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget. If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia’s solution involves delivering ingredients and recipes to people and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants. Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.Alicia 希望解决阻碍人们在预算内吃健康食品的问题。如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它。Alicia 的解决方案包括将食材和食谱交付给人们，然后使用 WhatsApp 群组与参与者交谈。每个 WhatsApp 群组都有一位导师，他会分享烹饪技巧和建议。 Pippa(皮帕)To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some of the messages on one of the ‘Bags of Taste’ WhatsApp chats.为了让您了解其运作方式，People Fixing the World 的团队在其中一个 “Bags of Taste” WhatsApp 聊天中朗读了一些消息。 Amy, mentor(Amy，导师)Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening? Our first recipe, chana masala is a classic. It needs an onion, which can be a pain to chop. So, try our way. [video posted]记得把冰箱袋放在冰箱里。我们能不能在星期二晚上之前做一个食谱？我们的第一个食谱 chana masala 是经典之作。它需要一个洋葱，切碎可能会很痛苦。所以，试试我们的方式。[视频发布] Ally(盟友)Love this method [chef emoji]. First time I’ve chopped an onion like this and it’s so neat and easy.喜欢这种方法 [厨师表情符号]。我第一次切这样的洋葱，它是如此整洁和简单。 Georgia(格鲁吉亚)I’m going to cook mine tomorrow. Looking forward to it.我明天要煮我的。期待它。 Ally(盟友)I’ve finished making my chana masala. I was a bit too heavy-handed with the chilli. My husband likes a lot of spice. So, I’d reduce that next time.我已经完成了我的 chana masala。我对辣椒有点太重了。我丈夫喜欢很多香料。所以，下次我会减少这个数字。 Georgie(乔治)The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic. We call something a classic to say that it is well-known and of good quality. We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.该小组的导师 Amy 将 chana masala 的食谱描述为经典之作。我们称某物为经典，以表示它是众所周知的且质量好。我们也可以将特定的书籍、电影或歌曲描述为经典。 Pippa(皮帕)Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop. If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.Amy 发送了一段视频，展示了一种切洋葱的技术，她将其描述为切洋葱很痛苦。如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那就很难做或令人讨厌。 Georgie(乔治)One of the participants, Ally, said that when she made the chana masala, she was a bit heavy-handed with the chilli. If you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it, and so Ally’s chana masala was very spicy!其中一位参与者 Ally 说，当她制作 chana masala 时，她对辣椒有点粗暴。如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多，所以 Ally 的 chana masala 非常辣！ Pippa(皮帕)Bags of Taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money. It’s certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgie. I asked you how much it costs for a meal at Sublimotion, thought to be the most expensive restaurant in the world.Bags of Taste 帮助人们学习新食谱并烹饪健康食品，而无需花太多钱。在我的问题中，这肯定比在餐厅吃饭便宜得多，Georgie。我问你，在被认为是世界上最昂贵的餐厅 Sublimotion 吃一顿饭要多少钱。 Georgie(乔治)Yes, I said a meal was €2,650.是的，我说一顿饭是 2,650 欧元。 Pippa(皮帕)Well, you were wrong. It’s actually €1,650, but I think that’s still pretty expensive.好吧，你错了。它实际上是 1,650 欧元，但我认为这仍然相当昂贵。 Georgie(乔治)It definitely is. OK. Let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.绝对是。还行。让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 bags of 开始，这意味着很多东西。 Pippa(皮帕)We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally, after a series of events.我们可以用副词 finally 来表示 finally， after a series of events。 Georgie(乔治)If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.如果你解决了一个问题，你就会尝试处理它并找到解决方案。 Pippa(皮帕)If we describe something, like a recipe, as a classic, we mean it’s well-known and of good quality.如果我们将某样东西（比如食谱）描述为经典，我们的意思是它是众所周知的并且质量好。 Georgie(乔治)If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.如果某件事做起来很痛苦，那么它就是烦人或难以做到的。 Pippa(皮帕)And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it. For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt – it tasted disgusting!如果你对某种成分很粗暴，你就会用得太多。例如，前几天我做了一些汤，盐有点重 —— 味道很恶心！ Georgie(乔治)Oh, that’s not very good! OK, once again, our 6 minutes are up. But you can test what you’ve learned with the interactive quiz on our website.

Hard to even compare, and the reason for that is because of artificial intelligence.它的散熱能效提高了 30%，性能令人難以置信。甚至難以比較，而原因就在於人工智能。 GeForce brought CUDA to the world. CUDA enabled AI, and AI has now come back to revolutionize computer graphics.GeForce 將 CUDA 帶給了世界。CUDA 賦能了 AI，而 AI 現在又回來徹底改變計算機圖形學。 What you’re looking at is real-time computer graphics, 100% path traced. For every pixel that’s rendered, artificial intelligence predicts the other 15.你現在看到的是實時計算機圖形，100% 路徑追蹤。對於渲染的每一個像素，人工智能會預測其餘的 15 個像素。 AI really came into the world’s consciousness about a decade ago. Started with perception AI, computer vision, speech recognition.大約十年前，AI 才真正進入了世界的視野。它始於感知 AI、計算機視覺、語音識別。 Then generative AI. Generative AI fundamentally changed how computing is done. From a retrieval computing model, we now have a generative computing model.接着是生成式 AI。生成式 AI 從根本上改變了計算的完成方式。從檢索式計算模型，我們現在擁有了生成式計算模型。 Now, AI understands the context, understands what we’re asking, understands the meaning of our request, and generates what it knows.現在，AI 能夠理解上下文，理解我們的提問，理解我們請求的含義，並生成它所知道的內容。 The last couple of two, three years, major breakthrough happened. Fundamental advance in artificial intelligence. We call it agentic AI.在過去的兩三年裏，發生了重大的突破。人工智能取得了根本性的進展。我們稱之爲智能體 AI。 Agentic AI basically means that you have an AI that has agency. It can perceive and understand the context of the circumstance.智能體 AI 基本上意味着你擁有一個具有自主性的 AI。它可以感知並理解環境的背景。 It can reason, very importantly, can reason about how to answer or how to solve a problem. And it can plan an action.它可以推理，非常重要的是，能夠推理如何回答或如何解決問題。並且它可以規劃行動。 At the foundation of agentic AI, of course, something that’s very new, reasoning. And then, of course, the next wave is already happening.當然，智能體 AI 的基礎是一些非常新的東西，比如推理能力。然後，下一波浪潮顯然已經在發生。 We’re going to talk a lot about that today. Robotics, which has been enabled by physical AI. AI that understands the physical world.我們今天會重點討論這個。機器人技術，它已由物理 AI 實現。即理解物理世界的 AI。 It understands things like friction and inertia, cause and effect, object permanence.它能理解像摩擦力、慣性、因果關係、物體恆存性這樣的事物。 When someone doesn’t mean to disappear from this universe, it’s still there. Just not seeable.當某物並非有意從這個宇宙消失時，它仍然存在，只是看不見而已。 And so that ability to understand the physical world, the three-dimensional world.因此，這種理解物理世界、三維世界的能力。 Is what’s going to enable a new era of AI we call physical AI, and it’s going to enable robotics.將會開啓一個我們稱爲物理 AI 的新紀元，並將賦能機器人技術。 The computation requirement, the scaling law of AI is more resilient, and in fact, hyper accelerated.AI 的計算需求和擴展定律更具彈性，並且實際上是超級加速的。 The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning.由於智能體 AI 和推理能力的發展，我們現階段所需的計算量。 Is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year.輕易就達到了我們去年此時認爲所需計算量的一百倍。 In training, there are two fundamental problems we have to solve. Where does the data come from? Where does the data come from?在訓練方面，我們必須解決兩個根本問題。數據從哪裏來？數據從哪裏來？ And how do we not have it be limited by human in the loop? There’s only so much data and so much human demonstration we can perform.以及我們如何才能不被“人類在環”所限制？我們能執行的數據量和人類演示是有限的。 And so this is the big breakthrough in the last couple years. Reinforcement learning, verifiable results.這就是過去幾年的重大突破。強化學習，可驗證的結果。 So you can kind of see that in fact, AI is going through an inflection point. It has become more useful because it’s smarter, it can reason.所以你可以看到，事實上，AI 正在經歷一個轉折點。它變得更加有用，因爲它更智能，能夠推理。 It is more used, you can tell it’s more used, because whenever you go to chat GPT these days, it seems like you have to wait longer and longer and longer, which is a good thing.它被使用得更頻繁了，你可以看出來它被用得更多了，因爲現在每當你去用 ChatGPT 時，似乎等待的時間越來越長，這是件好事。 It says a lot of people are using it with great effect. And the amount of computation necessary to train those models and to inference those models has grown tremendously.這說明很多人正在有效地使用它。而訓練這些模型和進行模型推理所需的計算量已經急劇增長。 So in just one year, and Blackwell has just started shipping, in just one year, you could see the incredible growth in AI infrastructure.因此，僅僅一年時間，而且 Blackwell 纔剛剛開始出貨，僅僅一年，你就能看到 AI 基礎設施令人難以置信的增長。 I’ve said before that I expect data center build out to reach a trillion dollars. And I am fairly certain we’re going to reach that very soon.我之前說過，我預計數據中心的建設規模將達到一萬億美元。而且我相當確定我們很快就會達到這個目標。 And the world is going through a platform shift from hand coded software running on general purpose computers to machine learning software running on accelerators and GPUs.世界正在經歷一場平臺轉變，從在通用計算機上運行的手動編碼軟件，轉向在加速器和 GPU 上運行的機器學習軟件。 This way of doing computation is at this point past this tipping point.這種計算方式目前已經越過了臨界點。 And we are now seeing the inflection point happening, the inflection happening in the world’s data center build outs.我們現在正看到轉折點的發生，這個轉折點正發生在世界數據中心的建設中。 So the first thing is a transition in the way we do computing. Second is an increase in recognition that the future of software requires capital investment.所以，首先是計算方式的轉變。其次是人們越來越認識到軟件的未來需要資本投入。 Now this is a very big idea. Whereas in the past we wrote the software and we ran it on computers, in the future the computer is going to generate the tokens for the software.這是一個非常重要的理念。過去我們編寫軟件並在計算機上運行，未來計算機將爲軟件生成 Token。 And so the computer has become a generator of tokens, not a retrieval of files.因此，計算機已經變成了 Token 的生成器，而不是文件的檢索器。 From retrieval based computing to generative based computing, from the old way of doing data centers to a new way of building these infrastructure, and I call them AI factories.從基於檢索的計算到基於生成的計算，從舊的數據中心運作方式到建設這些基礎設施的新方式，我稱之爲 AI 工廠。 They’re AI factories because it has one job and one job only, generating these incredible tokens.它們是 AI 工廠，因爲它們只有一個任務，且僅此一個任務，那就是生成這些令人難以置信的 Token。 So the world is going through a transition in not just the amount of data centers that will be built, but also how it’s built.所以世界正在經歷的轉變，不僅僅在於將要建設的數據中心的數量，還在於它們的建設方式。 Well everything in the data center will be accelerated, not all of its AI. This is in fact what GTC is all about.嗯，數據中心裏的所有東西都將被加速，但並非所有都是 AI。這實際上就是 GTC 的全部意義所在。 You need all kinds of libraries and frameworks. We call them CUDA-X libraries, acceleration frameworks for each one of these fields of science.你需要各種各樣的庫和框架。我們稱之爲 CUDA-X 庫，它們是針對各個科學領域的加速框架。 But you know AI started in the cloud. It started in the cloud for good reason because it turns out that AI needs infrastructure.但你知道，AI 是在雲端起步的。它在雲端起步是有充分理由的，因爲事實證明 AI 需要基礎設施。 It’s machine learning. If the science is machine learning then you need a machine to do the science.它是機器學習。如果這門科學是機器學習，那麼你就需要一臺機器來做這門科學。 And so machine learning requires infrastructure and the cloud data centers have infrastructure.因此，機器學習需要基礎設施，而云數據中心擁有基礎設施。 They also have extraordinary computer science, extraordinary research, the perfect circumstance for AI to take off in the cloud and the CSPs.它們還擁有非凡的計算機科學、非凡的研究，這是 AI 在雲端和雲服務提供商中騰飛的完美環境。 But that’s not where AI is limited to. AI will go everywhere. And we’re going to talk about AI in a lot of different ways.但 AI 並不僅限於此。AI 將無處不在。我們將以多種不同的方式討論 AI。 And the cloud service providers of course they like our leading edge technology.當然，雲服務提供商喜歡我們領先的技術。 They like the fact that we have full stack because accelerated computing as you know, as I was explaining earlier, is not about the chip.他們喜歡我們擁有全棧能力，因爲正如你所知，正如我之前解釋的，加速計算不僅僅是關於芯片。 It’s not even just the chip in the library. The programming model is the chip, the programming model, and a whole bunch of software that goes on top of it.它甚至不只是芯片和庫。編程模型就是芯片、編程模型，以及在其之上運行的大量軟件。 That entire stack is incredibly complex. There’s a whole bunch of companies, maybe 20 of them, who started during the NVIDIA time.整個技術棧極其複雜。有一大批公司，大約 20 家，是在英偉達時代起步的。 And what they do is just one thing. They host GPUs. They call themselves GPU clouds. All right, let’s talk about data centers.他們只做一件事。他們託管 GPU。他們稱自己爲 GPU 雲。好了，我們來談談數據中心。 Blackwell is in full production and this is what it looks like. It’s an incredible, incredible, you know, for people, for us, this is a sight of beauty.Blackwell 已經全面投產，這就是它的樣子。你知道，對於人們，對於我們來說，這是一種令人難以置信、難以置信的美景。 Would you agree? This is. Blackwell is way, way better than Hopper. And remember, this is not ISO chips. This is ISO power.你同意嗎？就是這樣。Blackwell 比 Hopper 好太多太多了。請記住，這不是同等芯片比較，這是同等功耗比較。 And in a reasoning model, Blackwell is 40 times, 40 times the performance of Hopper. Straight up.在推理模型中，Blackwell 的性能是 Hopper 的 40 倍，整整 40 倍。毫不含糊。 Okay, just to put it in perspective, this is what a 100 megawatt factory looks like. This is a 100 megawatt factory.好的，爲了讓大家有個概念，這就是一個 100 兆瓦工廠的樣子。這是一個 100 兆瓦的工廠。 You have, based on Hopper’s, you have 45,000 dies, 1400 racks, and it produces 300 million tokens per second. Okay?基於 Hopper 的話，你有 45,000 個裸片，1400 個機架，它每秒產生 3 億個 Token。明白嗎？ And then this is what it looks like with Blackwell. We’re now in full production of Blackwell.然後，這就是使用 Blackwell 的樣子。我們現在已經全面投產 Blackwell。 And now, in the second half of this year, we’ll easily transition into the upgrade. So we have the Blackwell Ultra, NVLink 72.現在，在今年下半年，我們將輕鬆過渡到升級版。所以我們有了 Blackwell Ultra，NVLink 72。 You know, it’s one and a half times more flops. It’s, you know, it’s got a new instruction for attention. It’s one and a half times more memory.你知道，它的浮點運算性能提高了一倍半。它，嗯，它有了一個新的用於注意力機制的指令。它的內存增加了一倍半。 All that memory is useful for things like KVCache. It’s, you know, two times more bandwidth, okay, for networking bandwidth.所有的內存對於像 KVCache 這樣的東西都很有用。它的帶寬，網絡帶寬，你知道，增加了一倍，好嗎。 And so you’re going to, now that we have the same architecture, we’ll just kind of gracefully glide into that. And that’s called Blackwell Ultra.所以，既然我們擁有相同的架構，我們將順利地過渡到那個階段。那就是所謂的 Blackwell Ultra。 Okay? So that’s coming second half of this year. The next click, one year out, is named after an astronomer. And her grandkids are here.好嗎？所以那將在今年下半年到來。下一次迭代，一年之後，是以一位天文學家的名字命名的。她的孫輩們今天也在場。 Her name is Vera Rubin. She discovered dark matter. Vera Rubin is incredible because the CPU is new.她的名字是維拉·魯賓。她發現了暗物質。Vera Rubin 平臺令人難以置信，因爲 CPU 是全新的。 It’s twice the performance of Grace, more memory, more bandwidth, and yet just a little tiny 50-watt CPU is really quite incredible.它的性能是 Grace 的兩倍，擁有更多內存、更大帶寬，然而僅僅是一個小小的 50 瓦 CPU，這真是相當不可思議。 Okay? And Rubin, brand new GPU. CX9, brand new networking SmartNIC. NVLink 6, brand new NVLink. Brand new memories, HBM4.好嗎？還有 Rubin，全新的 GPU。CX9，全新的網絡智能網卡。NVLink 6，全新的 NVLink。全新的內存，HBM4。 Basically, everything is brand new. Except for the chassis. And so Vera Rubin, NVLink 144, is the second half of next year.基本上，除了機箱，一切都是全新的。所以 Vera Rubin，NVLink 144，將在明年下半年推出。 And then this now sets the stage for the second half of the year, the following year, we call Rubin Ultra. NVLink 576, extreme scale-up.然後，這爲後年下半年奠定了基礎，我們稱之爲 Rubin Ultra。NVLink 576，極致擴展。 Each rack is 600 kilowatts. Two and a half million parts. Okay? And, obviously, a whole lot of GPUs. And everything is X-factor more.每個機架 600 千瓦。兩百五十萬個部件。好嗎？而且，顯然，有大量的 GPU。所有指標都呈 X 倍數增長。 So 14 times more, more flops, 15 exaflops. Instead of one exaflop, as I mentioned earlier, it’s now 15 exaflops scaled up exaflops.所以是 14 倍以上，更多的浮點運算能力，15 Exaflops。相比我之前提到的 1 Exaflop，現在是 15 Exaflops 的擴展浮點運算能力。 Okay? And it’s 300, what? 4.6 petabytes, so 4,600 terabytes per second scale-up bandwidth. I don’t mean aggregate. I mean scale-up bandwidth.好嗎？它是 300，什麼？4.6 Petabytes，也就是每秒 4600 Terabytes 的擴展帶寬。我不是指聚合帶寬，我說的是擴展帶寬。 And, of course, lots of brand new NVLink switch and CX9. Okay? So this is what Grace Blackwell looks like. And this is what Rubin looks like.當然，還有大量全新的 NVLink 交換機和 CX9。好嗎？所以這就是 Grace Blackwell 的樣子。這就是 Rubin 的樣子。 Now that gives you a sense of the pace at which we’re moving. This is the amount of scale-up flops. This is scale-up flops.現在這讓你瞭解了我們前進的速度。這是擴展浮點運算能力的量級。這是擴展浮點運算能力。 Hopper is 1x, Blackwell is 68x, Rubin is 900x. Okay? So that’s very quickly Nvidia’s roadmap. Our InfiniBand switch, the silicon is working fantastically.Hopper 是 1 倍，Blackwell 是 68 倍，Rubin 是 900 倍。好嗎？這就是英偉達的路線圖概覽。我們的 InfiniBand 交換機，其芯片運行得非常出色。 Second half of this year we will ship the silicon photonic switch in the second half of this year.今年下半年，我們將在今年下半年出貨硅光子交換機。 And the second half of next year we’ll ship the Spectrum X. Because of the MRM choice, because of the incredible technology risks that over the last five years.明年下半年，我們將出貨 Spectrum X。由於 MRM 的選擇，由於過去五年中我們承擔的巨大技術風險。 That we did and filed hundreds of patents and we’ve licensed it to our partners so that we can all build them.我們這樣做了，申請了數百項專利，並將其授權給我們的合作伙伴，以便我們大家都能製造它們。 Now we’re in a position to put silicon photonics with co-package options, no transceivers, fiber, direct fiber in into our switches with a radix of 512.現在我們能夠將硅光子技術與共封裝選項相結合，無需收發器，使用光纖，將直接光纖引入到我們具有 512 基數的交換機中。 This is the 512 ports.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat? NeilWell, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes. BethWell, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice. NeilThat’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change. BethIn this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilBut first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres? BethI’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres. NeilWell, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain: Dr Yvonne PintoBetween 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties. BethRice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water. NeilOver half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide. BethSo, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short. NeilTo grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India: Jean-Philippe LabordeWe’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission. Ruth AlexanderAnd how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go? Jean-Philippe LabordeThat was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better. NeilMany Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works. BethAs it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question? NeilI asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold. BethVarieties of something are different types of it. NeilIf there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it. BethIf you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it. NeilTo give it a go means to try doing something. BethAnd finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable. Once again our six minutes are up. If you’ve enjoyed this programme, why not try practising the new vocabulary you’ve learned with our worksheet – it’s available to download now from our website, bbclearningenglish.com… and you could also try out the quiz while you’re there! Goodbye for now! NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth. Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?我是贝丝。Neil，您经常吃什么类型的食物？ Neil(尼尔)Well, basic things that fill me up – that’s sort of bread, potatoes.嗯，让我吃饱的基本东西 —— 那种面包、土豆。 Beth(贝丝)Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people, is known as a staple. In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world there’s another food which is number one: rice.嗯，像这样很多人经常吃的食物，被称为主食。在英国，面包是一种流行的主食，但对于世界大部分地区来说，还有另一种食物是第一大食物：米饭。 Neil(尼尔)That’s right. Over half the world’s population eats rice as the staple food, especially in Asia. But rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop which needs lots of water to grow, and this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.没错。世界上超过一半的人口以大米为主食，尤其是在亚洲。但水稻是一种非常“缺水”的作物，需要大量的水才能生长，由于气候变化造成的干旱和洪水，这正在成为一个问题。 Beth(贝丝)In this programme, we’ll be hearing about a pioneering new technique helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases, and remember you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.在本节目中，我们将听到一项开创性的新技术，该技术帮助农民在面对不断变化的气候时种植水稻。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语，请记住，您可以在我们的网站上找到该程序的所有词汇，bbclearningenglish.com。 Neil(尼尔)But first I have a question for you, Beth. Just now I mentioned that rice is a very ‘thirsty’ crop – so how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice? Is it: a) 1,000 to 3,000 litres? b) 3,000 to 5,000 litres? or, c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres?但首先我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。刚才我提到水稻是一种非常“口渴”的作物 —— 那么种植一公斤水需要多少水呢？是：a） 1,000 到 3,000 升吗？b） 3,000 至 5,000 升？或者，c） 5,000 至 7,000 升？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to say c) 5,000 to 7,000 litres.我要说的是 c） 5,000 到 7,000 升。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. Dr Yvonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI for short, based in the Philippines. Here she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。Yvonne Pinto 博士是位于菲律宾的国际水稻研究所（简称 IRRI）的总干事。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》解释了更多关于大米在全球流行的情况： Dr Yvonne Pinto(YvonnePinto医师)Between 50 and 56 percent of the world’s population rely on rice as the principal staple. Now, that’s roughly about four billion people, and it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. But increasingly the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa, and of course there are also Latin American and European rice varieties.世界上 50% 到 56% 的人口以大米为主要主食。现在，大约有 40 亿人，它是真正广泛种植的商品之一，尤其是在南亚和东南亚。但在非洲等大陆，人们对它的需求越来越大，当然也有拉丁美洲和欧洲的大米品种。 Beth(贝丝)Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold. Like other crops, rice has varieties – different types, for example brown rice, long-grained rice or basmati. Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.大米是一种商品，一种可以买卖的产品。与其他作物一样，大米也有多种类型，例如糙米、长粒米或印度樟米。今天对水稻的大部分研究都集中在培育能够适应不断变化的环境并在水过多或过少的条件下生长的新品种。 Neil(尼尔)Over half the world’s population eats rice and there’s a growing demand in Africa and Europe too, so clearly there’s an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.世界上超过一半的人口吃大米，非洲和欧洲的需求也在不断增长，因此很明显，全世界对大米都有胃口和强烈的愿望。 Beth(贝丝)So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way? Jean-Philippe Laborde, director of rice company, Tilda, thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called Alternate Wet Drying, or AWD for short.那么，是否有可能以更环保的方式种植水稻呢？大米公司 Tilda 的董事 Jean-Philippe Laborde 认为，答案在于一种称为交替湿式干燥（简称 AWD）的新种植技术。 Neil(尼尔)To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields, or paddies, which then dry out and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15cm underground so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field. Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow, but using AWD this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions. Here’s Jean-Philippe Laborde, telling Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India:为了种植水稻，农民会经历淹没田地或稻田的循环，然后稻田干涸，需要再次被淹没。使用 AWD 时，测量管被放置在地下 15 厘米处，以便农民可以检查田地任何部分的水位。通常，水稻需要 25 次洪水和干燥循环才能生长，但使用 AWD 可以减少到 20 次循环，从而为农民节省用水并减少甲烷排放。这是让-菲利普·拉博德 （Jean-Philippe Laborde） 告诉 BBC 国际频道《食物链》的主持人露丝·亚历山大 （Ruth Alexander） 他是如何开始对印度农民进行 AWD 实验的： Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)We’ve got, last year, 1,268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall methane emission.去年，我们有 1,268 名农民应用了这种 AWD 技术来减少甲烷总排放量。 Ruth Alexander(露丝·亚历山大)And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?您是如何说服那些农民试一试的？ Jean-Philippe Laborde(让-菲利普·拉博德)That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is, for farmers, the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop… that they’re getting obviously something better.这相当具有挑战性，因为显然，对于农民来说，主要挑战是担心失去收入。他们需要在作物结束时看到切实的结果……他们显然得到了更好的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Phillipe’s experiment. If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved. In other words, you give it a go – you try doing something to see if it works.许多印度农民都加入了让-菲利普的实验。如果您参与某事，即表示您同意行动计划并参与其中。换句话说，你试一试 – 你尝试做一些事情，看看它是否有效。 Beth(贝丝)As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable. Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased, methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased… Right, Neil, isn’t it time you revealed the answer to your question?事实证明，新技术产生了切实的结果，结果是真实且可衡量的。使用 AWD，种植水稻所需的水和电量减少，甲烷气体排放量减少，最重要的是，水稻产量增加……对，Neil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Neil(尼尔)I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just 1 kilogram of rice, and the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with commodity, a product, like rice, that can be bought and sold.我问种植 1 公斤水需要多少升水，答案是 3,000 到 5,000 升水，非常口渴，但并不像你想象的那么口渴。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从商品开始，一种可以买卖的产品，比如大米。 Beth(贝丝)Varieties of something are different types of it.某物的种类是它的不同类型的。 Neil(尼尔)If there’s an appetite for something, there’s a strong desire or demand for it.如果对某样东西有胃口，就会有强烈的愿望或需求。 Beth(贝丝)If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.如果你同意一个想法或计划，你就同意做某事并参与其中。 Neil(尼尔)To give it a go means to try doing something.To give it a go 的意思是尝试做某事。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. PippaAnd I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness. So, what makes you happy, Neil? NeilIt makes me happy when I’m with a group of old friends and we’re having a good laugh. How about you, Pippa? PippaCats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke. That always makes me happy. NeilI’m not surprised. That sounds great. PippaSo, happiness means different things to different people, but what’s for sure is that most people would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level with the idea of Gross National Happiness, or GNH. NeilWe’ll be hearing more about Gross National Happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon, but first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it’s not just the people of Bhutan who want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an International Day of Happiness. But when is that? Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November? PippaI’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK. NeilOK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost. PippaFor many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the country and give it the benefits of modern technology, but without damaging traditional culture, so he invited outside experts to develop the idea of Gross National Happiness. One expert was Dr Ha Vinh Tho, speaking here to Charmaine Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry: Dr Ha Vinh ThoSo, his idea was: ‘How could we modernise and open our country without losing its culture, its environment, and its very strong social fabric?’ Because Bhutan was one of the only countries in Asia that was never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant, mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies. Charmaine CozierSo the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage. PippaBhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together. NeilUnlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled. PippaAs a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing. NeilBhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain. PippaSo in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy. NeilOriginally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry: Charmaine CozierThe project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain. Dr Lhawang UgyelThe intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work. PippaAs well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training. NeilThe idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people. PippaYes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil… NeilYes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is? PippaI said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK. NeilWell, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March. PippaNice. NeilAnd if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology. PippaA country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together. NeilThe adjective intact means complete and undamaged. PippaIf something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else. NeilA brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money. PippaAnd finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now! NeilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Pippa(皮帕)And I’m Pippa. In this programme we’re talking about happiness.

How about you, Pippa?当我和一群老朋友在一起，我们开怀大笑时，我很高兴。你呢，皮帕？ Pippa(皮帕)Cats make me very happy. Especially if I see a cat on the street that I don’t know, and it lets me give it a little stroke.

Is International Happiness Day: a) the 20th of March? b) the 20th of June? c) the 20th of November?我们很快就会听到更多关于 Gross National Happiness 的信息，并学习一些有用的新词汇，但首先 Pippa，我有一个问题要问你。当然，不仅仅是不丹人民想要快乐。事实上，联合国甚至宣布了国际幸福日。但那是什么时候呢？国际幸福日是：a） 3 月 20 日吗？b） 6 月 20 日？c） 11 月 20 日？ Pippa(皮帕)I’m going to say the 20th of June, because it would be sunny in the UK.我要说的是 6 月 20 日，因为英国会阳光明媚。 Neil(尼尔)OK, let’s find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, briefly, Gross National Happiness means preserving Bhutan’s natural environment and culture through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan’s government sees these goals as more important than growing the economy at any cost.好的，让我们看看您是否在节目结束时。现在，简而言之，国民幸福总值意味着通过可持续和生态友好型发展来保护不丹的自然环境和文化。不丹政府认为这些目标比不惜一切代价发展经济更重要。 Pippa(皮帕)For many years, Bhutan was closed to the outside world – the first foreign tourists arrived in 1974, and television was only introduced in 1999.

And so the idea was that Gross National Happiness should be the focus on all governmental decisions and policies.所以，他的想法是：’我们如何在不失去文化、环境和强大的社会结构的情况下实现国家的现代化和开放？因为不丹是亚洲唯一从未被殖民的国家之一，所以它的文化非常完整和充满活力，主要是佛教文化。因此，我们的想法是，国民幸福总值应该是所有政府决策和政策的重点。 Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)So the wellbeing and happiness of citizens took centre stage.因此，公民的福祉和幸福成为中心议题。 Pippa(皮帕)Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good relationships within communities and these hold society together.不丹拥有强大的社会结构，这意味着社区内部有良好的关系，这些关系将社会团结在一起。 Neil(尼尔)Unlike other Asian countries, Bhutan was never colonised, so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact – they’re complete and unspoiled.与其他亚洲国家不同，不丹从未被殖民，因此其佛教文化和传统完好无损 —— 它们是完整且未受破坏的。 Pippa(皮帕)As a result, the happiness of Bhutan’s people took centre stage, it became the most important thing.因此，不丹人民的幸福成为中心，它成为最重要的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Bhutan’s emphasis on happiness has been admired around the world, but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as the brain drain.不丹对幸福的重视受到了全世界的钦佩，但也存在问题。一个是不丹工人迁移到印度和其他国家，以寻找收入更高的工作和机会，这就是所谓的人才流失。 Pippa(皮帕)So in 2023, the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called, The Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles, all powered by renewable energy.因此，在 2023 年，不丹国王宣布了一项耗资数百万美元的项目，名为“正念之城”，这是一座基于精神和环境原则建造的新喜马拉雅城市，全部由可再生能源提供动力。 Neil(尼尔)Originally from Bhutan, Dr Lhawang Ugyel, is the project’s director and spoke with Charmaine Cozier for BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:来自不丹的 Lhawang Ugyel 博士是该项目的主任，他与 BBC 国际频道的 Charmaine Cozier 进行了交谈， 调查. Charmaine Cozier(查梅因·科齐尔)The project is also about reversing Bhutan’s brain drain.该项目还旨在扭转不丹的人才流失。 Dr Lhawang Ugyel(LhawangUgyel医生)The intention is to have locals run this whole Mindfulness City, so in that sense it’s also to attract the migrants that have left, and in the process of having worked abroad, gained the extra skills, come back to the Mindfulness City and work.目的是让当地人管理整个正念城市，所以从这个意义上说，这也是为了吸引已经离开的移民，他们在国外工作，获得了额外的技能，回到正念城市工作。 Pippa(皮帕)As well as being a futuristic eco-city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan’s brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra skills that they’ve learned abroad through upskilling. And upskilling is the process where workers’ skills are improved through training.除了是一个未来主义的生态城市外，正念之城还希望通过吸引工人回到不丹来阻止不丹的人才流失。然后，这些当地工人可以通过提升技能来使用他们在国外学到的额外技能。技能提升是通过培训提高工人技能的过程。 Neil(尼尔)The idea of Gross National Happiness might sound unusual, but it’s interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its people.国民幸福总值的概念听起来可能很不寻常，但看到不丹平衡经济增长和人民幸福感是很有趣的。 Pippa(皮帕)Yes, that’s true – and it reminds me of your question, Neil…是的，这是真的 —— 这让我想起了你的问题，尼尔…… Neil(尼尔)Yes, I asked you what the date of International Happiness Day is?是的，我问你国际幸福日的日期是哪一天？ Pippa(皮帕)I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.我说那是英国夏天的 6 月 20 日。 Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe it’s better for people in the Southern hemisphere because it’s the 20th of March.嗯，也许这对南半球的人们更好，因为现在是 3 月 20 日。 Pippa(皮帕)Nice.好。 Neil(尼尔)And if you got that answer right, why not try our interactive quiz which you’ll find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with modernise, to make something more modern, for example through introducing technology.如果您答对了，为什么不试试我们的互动测验，您可以在我们的网站上找到 bbclearningenglish.com！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从 modernize 开始，让一些东西更现代，例如通过引入技术。 Pippa(皮帕)A country’s social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.一个国家的社会结构是指将一个社区联系在一起的关系。 Neil(尼尔)The adjective intact means complete and undamaged.形容词 intact 的意思是完整和未损坏。 Pippa(皮帕)If something takes centre stage, it becomes more important than anything else.如果某件事占据中心位置，它就变得比其他任何事情都重要。 Neil(尼尔)A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.当大量受过教育和技能娴熟的人离开自己的国家到另一个可以赚更多钱的国家生活和工作时，就会发生人才流失。 Pippa(皮帕)And finally, upskilling means improving workers’ skills through training and experience.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead. NeilVaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA. BethSo, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilNow I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox? BethI’m going to say polio. NeilOK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry: Dr Meredith McKeanThere’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade. BethDr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one. NeilCancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on. BethSo, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage. NeilSo, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry: Prof Eduardo SanchezBasically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system. BethIn cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way. NeilTo recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually. BethSo, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer? NeilI asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine? BethAnd I said polio. Was I right? NeilYou were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery. BethA number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say. NeilThe phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away. BethIf you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit. NeilBeing blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat. BethAnd finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon. Bye for now! NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth. In our lifetime, 1 in 5 people will be affected by cancer, a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumours in the body. Tumours can be benign, meaning not cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and in 2022 there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancers worldwide. But in this programme, we’ll be focusing on some good news instead.我是贝丝。在我们的一生中，每 5 人中就有 1 人会受到癌症的影响，癌症是一种细胞不受控制地生长并导致体内肿瘤的疾病。肿瘤可以是良性的，即非癌性，也可以是恶性的，即癌性，到 2022 年，全球估计有 970 万人死于恶性癌症。但在这个节目中，我们将专注于一些好消息。 Neil(尼尔)Vaccines are medicine which protect the human body by making it immune from a certain disease. Now, there’s been a sudden and important discovery – a breakthrough - in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.疫苗是通过使人体免受某种疾病的免疫来保护人体的药物。现在，在开发一种名为 mRNA 的新疫苗方面，出现了一个突然而重要的发现 —— 一个突破。 Beth(贝丝)So, could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality? That’s what we’ll be finding out, as well as learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time, you can find a transcript for the programme on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.那么，癌症疫苗会很快成为现实吗？这就是我们将要发现的，以及学习一些有用的新单词和短语。请记住，如果您喜欢听六分钟英语并想同时阅读，您可以在我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com 上找到该节目的文字记录。 Neil(尼尔)Now I have a question for you, Beth. We’ve mentioned some of the most recent vaccines, but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat? Was it: a) flu? b) polio? or c) smallpox?现在我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。我们已经提到了一些最新的疫苗，但第一个成功的疫苗治疗了哪种疾病？是：a） 流感？b） 脊髓灰质炎？或 c） 天花？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to say polio.我要说的是小儿麻痹症。 Neil(尼尔)OK! Well, we’ll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme. You might wonder why the body’s immune system doesn’t fight cancer automatically. The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from our natural defences, as Dr Meredith McKean, director of research at Tennessee Oncology, explained to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry:还行！好吧，我们将在节目结束时找出正确答案。您可能想知道为什么身体的免疫系统不自动对抗癌症。原因是癌症有巧妙的方式躲避我们的自然防御，正如田纳西州肿瘤学研究主任 Meredith McKean 博士向 BBC 世界服务节目 The Inquiry 解释的那样： Dr Meredith McKean(MeredithMcKean博士)There’s been a number of studies that have demonstrated the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up signals or proteins, essentially, on the surface of the cancer cells, to tell the immune system, ‘Go away! There’s nothing here to look at!’ And so it’s actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind of take the brakes off, and be more aggressive in fighting cancer. That’s really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.有许多研究表明，癌症已经开发出不同的技术，能够发出信号或蛋白质，本质上是在癌细胞的表面，告诉免疫系统，’走开！这里没什么可看的！因此，它实际上是劫持了这些受体，基本上是告诉免疫系统放松刹车，在对抗癌症方面更加积极。这确实让免疫疗法在过去十年中取得了突破。 Beth(贝丝)Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads. She uses the phrase a number of to mean several, but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course several studies are better than just one.McKean 博士说，许多研究已经证明了癌症是如何扩散的。她使用短语 a number of 来表示几个，但这也使她的说法更有说服力，因为当然，几项研究总比一项好。 Neil(尼尔)Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells. It’s like they’re saying Nothing to see here! – an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something, either in a playful way, or to cover something up. For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say, “Nothing to see here!” to move people on.癌细胞通过假装是健康细胞来关闭免疫系统。就好像他们在说 Nothing to see here！– 一个非正式的短语，可以用来鼓励人们以俏皮的方式移动或移开某物，或者掩盖某物。例如，犯罪现场的警察可能会说，“这里没什么可看的！ Beth(贝丝)So, in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells – it takes control of something which doesn’t belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.所以，换句话说，癌症劫持了健康的细胞 —— 它控制了不属于它的东西，并利用它为自己谋取利益。 Neil(尼尔)So, how would a vaccine change things? Well, existing treatments, like chemotherapy, aggressively target the cancer, but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects. New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand, retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those, and only those, naturally – even in patients with the disease already. Here’s, Professor Eduardo Sanchez, of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, The Inquiry:那么，疫苗将如何改变现状呢？好吧，现有的治疗方法，如化疗，积极地针对癌症，但也攻击健康组织，产生令人不快的副作用。另一方面，新的突破性疫苗重新训练免疫系统识别癌细胞并自然地消除这些细胞 —— 即使是已经患有这种疾病的患者。以下是德克萨斯州安德森癌症中心的爱德华多·桑切斯 （Eduardo Sanchez） 教授向 BBC 国际频道的 The Inquiry 解释的更多内容： Prof Eduardo Sanchez(EduardoSanchez教授)Basically the cancer cells are telling the immune system, ‘Don’t attack me, don’t eat me’, right? The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells, becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate, and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-educate the immune system.基本上，癌细胞在告诉免疫系统，’不要攻击我，不要吃我’，对吧？免疫系统已经忘记了如何识别这些癌细胞，对识别癌细胞产生的那些畸变变得盲目，我们想用疫苗做的是重新教育免疫系统。 Beth(贝丝)In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths – it completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger, so the vaccine re- educates the immune system, or teaches it to behave, in a different way.在癌症患者中，免疫系统对癌变的生长视而不见 —— 它完全没有注意到它们或意识到它们的危险，因此疫苗以不同的方式重新教育免疫系统或教它行为。 Neil(尼尔)To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences, whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find and attack cancer cells naturally. Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.回顾一下，一些癌症治疗通过疏通我们受阻的自然防御来起作用，而疫苗则重新训练免疫系统以自然地发现和攻击癌细胞。由于这两种方法完全不同，因此它们可以一起使用，也可以单独使用。 Beth(贝丝)So, to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away. But how about your question – isn’t it time you revealed the answer?所以，回答我最初的问题，Neil，癌症疫苗可能并不遥远。但是你的问题怎么样 —— 现在是不是该透露答案了？ Neil(尼尔)I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine?我问哪种疾病首先被疫苗成功治疗？ Beth(贝丝)And I said polio. Was I right?我说的是小儿麻痹症。我是对的吗？ Neil(尼尔)You were wrong, I’m afraid. The correct option was C, which is smallpox. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.恐怕你错了。正确的选项是 C，即天花。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从突破开始，一个突然的、戏剧性的和重要的发现。 Beth(贝丝)A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.许多事物意味着几个或许多，可以增加你所说的可信度。 Neil(尼尔)The phrase, Nothing to see here! is used to discourage people from paying attention or looking too closely at something, or to move them away.短语 Nothing to see here！用于阻止人们注意或过于仔细地观察某物，或将他们移开。 Beth(贝丝)If you hijack something, you use something that doesn’t belong to you for your own benefit.如果你劫持了什么东西，你就利用了不属于你的东西来为自己谋取利益。 Neil(尼尔)Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.对某事视而不见意味着没有注意到它或将其视为威胁。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way. Once again our six minutes are up, but if you’re hungry for more, head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you can find the worksheet for this programme, and it has a quiz in it! Good luck and we’ll see you again soon.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. BethAnd I’m Beth. In this programme, we’re discussing the positives and negatives of social media in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment because of what’s happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds’ access to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having social media in your life. NeilWell, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing who live far away and one bad thing is it’s really addictive and a massive waste of time. BethWell, it’s interesting to hear a man’s perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like cyber-bullying, it’s often young women who are most affected, so soon we’ll be hearing from women in different countries about their online experiences. And remember you can find all the vocabulary and a worksheet on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. NeilBut first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world? Was it: a) Facebook? b) Instagram? or c) TikTok? BethOh, I’m going to say TikTok. NeilWell, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, let’s start with the positive side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, twenty-one-year-old Haleigh Hurst campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World: Haleigh HurstI do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen. BethHaleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot. NeilBut of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men. BethMaanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World: Maanvi Sharma… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life… Kemi AdeyemiSome men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”. NeilMaanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise. BethAnd Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil. NeilI asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth? BethTikTok. NeilI’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening. BethIf you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much. NeilTo be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation. BethThe expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief. NeilIf you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them. BethAnd finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!

Here, she explains one benefit of social media to BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，让我们从社交媒体的积极一面开始。作为俄克拉荷马大学（Oklahoma University）的一名政治专业学生，21岁的哈利·赫斯特（Haleigh Hurst）参加了2024年美国总统大选。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 解释了社交媒体的一个好处： Haleigh Hurst(哈利·赫斯特)I do think social media has played a huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running. I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth of social media it has sparked a lot more debates. I think my generation too has seen so many climactic things happen.我确实认为社交媒体在教育年轻选民了解不同的政策和不同的竞选人方面发挥了巨大作用。我知道特朗普最近说，他心里对 TikTok 情有独钟。随着社交媒体的发展，它引发了更多的辩论。我想我们这一代人也见过很多高潮的事情发生。 Beth(贝丝)Haleigh thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates and conversations – it causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone, you feel affectionate and fond of it; you like it a lot.Haleigh 认为社交媒体的一个好处是它引发了辩论和对话 —— 它导致辩论开始。她评论说唐纳德·特朗普是社交媒体的粉丝，他说他对TikTok情有独钟。如果你对某事或某人情有独钟，你会感到深情和喜欢它；你很喜欢它。 Neil(尼尔)But of course, that’s not the whole story. Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their lives, and the pressure they feel to appear ‘perfect’ online, especially from men.但当然，这并不是故事的全部。越来越多的年轻女性报告了社交媒体对她们生活的负面影响，以及她们在网上显得“完美”的压力，尤其是来自男性的压力。 Beth(贝丝)Maanvi Sharma, aged 28, is a businesswoman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India. And Kemi Adeyemi, is a twenty-six-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women discussed these social media worries with BBC World Service programme, Pick of the World:Maanvi Sharma 现年 28 岁，是一名女商人和模特，在 Instagram 上拥有大量粉丝，居住在印度德里。Kemi Adeyemi 是一位来自尼日利亚拉各斯的 26 岁旅游博主。这两位年轻女性都在 BBC 世界服务节目 Pick of the World 中讨论了这些社交媒体上的担忧： Maanvi Sharma(马安维·夏尔马)… the person you’re dating, they might leave you just because of the social media. They might think that you’re not good for, you know, marriage like…. You can’t be a good partner because you’re on social media, because you’re being watched by a lot of people, and they feel a little intimidated by this… “You know what, we saw your girlfriend - Oh my gosh! She was wearing this, Oh my God!” But it’s affecting my personal life……你正在约会的人，他们可能会因为社交媒体而离开你。他们可能会认为你不适合，你知道的，像……你不能因为你在社交媒体上而成为一个好的伙伴，因为你被很多人看着，他们对此感到有点害怕……“你知道吗，我们看到了你的女朋友 —— 哦，我的天哪！她穿着这个，天哪！但它正在影响我的个人生活…… Kemi Adeyemi(凯米·阿德耶米)Some men or some people, they want you to shrink yourself so that they can, like, be the bigger person. They get to listen to what your friends say about you, what your family says about you, and they are not able to, like, stand up for you, to say, “Oh, I know this person. I believe she’s not, like, doing these things for other reasons”.有些人或有些人，他们希望你缩小自己，这样他们就可以成为更大的人。他们可以听你的朋友怎么说你，你的家人怎么说你，但他们无法站出来为你说，’哦，我认识这个人。我相信她不是因为其他原因做这些事情。 Neil(尼尔)Maanvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her posts and photos, using expressions like, ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ to express their shock or surprise.Maanvi 认为一些男人被她在 Instagram 上的受欢迎程度吓倒了。Intimidated 的意思是因为你缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。她感觉到人们会八卦她的帖子和照片，使用诸如“哦，我的天哪”和“哦，我的上帝”之类的表达来表达他们的震惊或惊讶。 Beth(贝丝)And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself, a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people uncomfortable, or to fit in. When she’s bullied online, Kemi says that these people don’t stand up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who’s being criticised or bullied. And I think it’s time you revealed the answer to your question, Neil.凯米同意。她说，在社交媒体上，有些人希望她缩小自己，这句话的意思是你没有充分利用自己的潜力，以避免让人们感到不舒服，或者为了融入。当她在网上被欺负时，凯米说这些人不会为她挺身而出。To stand up for someone 的意思是为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持。我认为你是时候透露你问题的答案了，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024 – Facebook, Instagram or TikTok? What did you say Beth?我问 2024 年世界上使用最频繁的社交媒体平台是哪个 —— Facebook、Instagram 还是 TikTok？你怎么说贝丝？ Beth(贝丝)TikTok.TikTok的。 Neil(尼尔)I’m afraid you’re wrong. It’s Facebook, with over three billion regular users. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme, starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something, such as a debate or argument, to start happening.恐怕你错了。它是 Facebook，拥有超过 30 亿的固定用户。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个程序中学到的词汇，从动词 spark 开始，意思是导致某事开始发生，例如辩论或争论。 Beth(贝丝)If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them; you like them very much.如果你对某人情有独钟，你就会对他们产生感情；你很喜欢他们。 Neil(尼尔)To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.To be intimidated 的意思是因为您对某种情况缺乏信心而感到害怕或紧张。 Beth(贝丝)The expressions ‘Oh my gosh!’ and ‘Oh my God!’ are exclamations of strong feelings like shock, surprise, anger or disbelief.“Oh my gosh！”和“Oh my God！”这些表达是对强烈情绪的感叹，如震惊、惊讶、愤怒或不相信。 Neil(尼尔)If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable, or to fit in with them.如果你缩小自己，你就会让自己变得更小，并且不会充分利用你的潜力来让别人感到舒适，或者为了适应他们。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being bullied. Once again, our time is up! But if you’re ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this programme! See you there soon!最后，To stand up for someone 的意思是大声疾呼地为遭受霸凌的人辩护。我们的时间又一次到了！但是，如果您准备好了解更多，请前往 BBC Learning English 网站尝试带有此计划的测验工作表！期待很快与您相见！ Neil(尼尔)Goodbye!再见！ 【核心词汇】a soft spotan affectionate liking or fondness for someone or something对…特别偏爱对某人或某事物怀有深厚的喜爱或偏爱He has a soft spot for his niece.他特别疼爱他的侄女。 sparkcause (a debate, conversation, fight etc) to start happening引发引起（一场辩论、谈话、争吵等）的发生Her speech sparked a heated debate.她的讲话引发了一场激烈的辩论。 intimidatedfrightened or nervous because of a lack of confidence受恐吓的由于缺乏自信而感到害怕或紧张I was intimidated by his aggressive manner.他的咄咄逼人的态度让我感到害怕。 Oh my gosh! &#x2F; Oh my God!expression of feelings such as shock, surprise, anger, disbelief我的天哪！表达震惊、惊讶、愤怒、不相信等情绪的感叹词Oh my gosh, did you see that car crash?我的天哪，你看到那场车祸了吗？ shrink yourselfmake yourself smaller and don’t use your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable缩小自己为了让别人感到舒服而让自己变得渺小，不发挥全部潜能Don’t shrink yourself; let your talent shine.别妄自菲薄；让你的才能闪光。 stand up for (someone)be vocal in defending or supporting a person who is being criticised or bullied为…辩护大声疾呼为受到批评或欺凌的人辩护或支持She always stands up for the underdog.她总是为弱者辩护。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】揭秘网络愤怒诱饵陷阱！","path":"/2025/02/13/wechat-2025-02-13/","content":"【英文脚本】PhilHello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilIf you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more. BethBut now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. PhilGreat, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software? BethI am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook. PhilOK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily: Andrea JonesThe more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people. Megan LawtonAndrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […] Andrea JonesAs a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative. BethAndrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve. PhilIt doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage. BethSo, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily: Dr William BradyIf you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue. PhilInfluencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people. BethBiases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention. PhilSo, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer. BethOK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is. PhilI did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth? BethIt is, yes. PhilRight again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it. BethThe structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too. PhilTo incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent. BethThe adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage. PhilEyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme. BethAnd finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now! PhilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I’m Phil.您好，这里是 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语，我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)If you use the internet, and nearly everyone does, you’ve probably read headlines like this: You won’t believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done! Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.如果你使用互联网，而且几乎每个人都使用互联网，你可能读过这样的头条新闻：你不会相信这位名人做了什么整容手术！像这样的标题被称为点击诱饵，用来吸引你的注意力并让你阅读更多内容。 Beth(贝丝)But now, a new trend called rage bait is spreading across social media. Rage bait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged. In this programme, we’ll explore the trend of rage-baiting, and, as usual, we’ll learn some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.但现在，一种称为愤怒诱饵的新趋势正在社交媒体上传播。愤怒诱饵是旨在让您生气或愤怒的在线内容。在这个节目中，我们将探索愤怒诱饵的趋势，并且像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些都可以在我们的网站上找到，bbclearningenglish.com。 Phil(菲尔)Great, but first it’s time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we’ve been using: ‘clickbait’ and ‘rage bait’. Both contain the word, ‘bait’, but what is its actual meaning? Is bait: a) a strong feeling of anger? b) food put on a hook to catch fish or animals? c) a piece of computer software?很好，但首先是我的问题，贝丝，这是关于我们一直在使用的两个术语：“点击诱饵”和“愤怒诱饵”。两者都包含“诱饵”一词，但它的实际含义是什么？诱饵是否：a） 强烈的愤怒感？b） 用钩子钓鱼或动物的食物？c） 一个计算机软件？ Beth(贝丝)I am fairly confident that it is b) – food put on a hook.我相当有信心它是 b） – 食物上钩。 Phil(菲尔)OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Here’s how rage bait works: a creator posts a provocative piece of content online, a message maybe, or a video. People see it, feel outraged, and comment angrily. Others see it, like it and share it around. Either way, the content creates interest, increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator. Here’s marketing strategist, Andrea Jones, explaining more to Megan Lawton, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Business Daily:还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。愤怒诱饵的工作原理是这样的：创作者在网上发布挑衅性内容，可能是一条消息，或者一个视频。人们看到它，感到愤怒，并愤怒地评论。其他人看到它、喜欢它并分享它。无论哪种方式，内容都会引起兴趣，增加互联网流量并为创作者赚钱。以下是营销策略师 Andrea Jones 向 BBC 世界服务节目主持人 Megan Lawton 解释的更多内容： Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid. And so they will do anything… some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views they get, the more that they get paid, even if, even if, those views are negative or inciting rage and anger in people.他们创建的内容越多，他们获得的参与度就越高，他们获得的报酬就越多。所以他们会做任何事情……一些创作者会不惜一切代价获得更多观看次数，因为他们获得的观看次数越多，他们获得的报酬就越多，即使这些观看次数是负面的或煽动人们的愤怒和愤怒。 Megan Lawton(梅根·劳顿)Andrea, how is rage bait different to clickbait or other online tactics? […]Andrea，愤怒诱饵与点击诱饵或其他在线策略有何不同？[…] Andrea Jones(安德里亚·琼斯)As a marketer, I’m always, you know, coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and rage bait or even its long-lost cousin, clickbait content… When we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what’s in that piece of content and it comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.作为一名营销人员，我总是，你知道的，指导我的客户，并与他们讨论在他们的营销中使用钩子，对吧？我认为 hook 和 rage bait 甚至它失传已久的表亲 clickbait 内容之间的区别……当我们考虑一个钩子时，对我来说，钩子准确地反映了该内容中的内容，它来自一个信任的地方，而愤怒诱饵的内容则被设计为纵性的。 Beth(贝丝)Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes, even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens, the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, so another thing increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you’ll improve.Andrea 说，帖子得到的反应越多，创作者赚的钱就越多，即使这些反应是仇恨的。她使用结构，一件事发生得越多，其他事情发生得越多，来表明当一件事反复发生时，另一件事也会因此而增加。例如，你练习英语的次数越多，你的进步就越大。 Phil(菲尔)It doesn’t matter that the content is designed to incite outrage – to encourage unpleasant or violent reactions. That’s why Andrea thinks rage bait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more truthful about its content, rage bait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its own advantage.这些内容旨在煽动愤怒 —— 鼓励令人不快或暴力的反应，这并不重要。这就是为什么 Andrea 认为愤怒诱饵比点击诱饵更糟糕。虽然点击诱饵的内容更真实，但愤怒诱饵是纵性的，这意味着它试图影响某事以使其自身有利。 Beth(贝丝)So, it’s not hard to see why many people think rage bait is toxic. So, if you’re wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr William Brady explains the psychology behind rage bait to BBC World Service’s, Business Daily:所以，不难看出为什么很多人认为愤怒诱饵是有毒的。所以，如果你想知道人们为什么首先会做出反应，请听听威廉·布雷迪博士向 BBC 世界服务部《商业日报》解释愤怒诱饵背后的心理学： Dr William Brady(WilliamBrady博士)If you are an influencer and you want to figure out, ‘Well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content?’ Well, you need to exploit those biases we have in our psychology because that’s the content we’ll pay more attention to. In turn that’s the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.如果你是一个有影响力的人，你想弄清楚，’好吧，我如何在我的内容上获得更多的眼球？嗯，你需要利用我们在心理学中存在的那些偏见，因为那是我们将更加关注的内容。反过来，这就是算法将放大的内容，这最终意味着更多的广告收入。 Phil(菲尔)Influencers want more eyeballs on their content – more people to view their website or social media posts – and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases – feelings – which are often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people.有影响力的人希望他们的内容有更多的眼球 —— 更多的人查看他们的网站或社交媒体帖子 —— 并利用人类心理学来做到这一点。从心理学上讲，我们都有偏见 – 感觉 – 这些偏见通常是无意识的，要么支持要么反对某个想法或一群人。 Beth(贝丝)Biases are emotional, and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species, creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.偏见是情绪化的，由于倾听我们的情绪对人类物种的进化至关重要，创作者知道激发我们的情绪会吸引我们的注意力。 Phil(菲尔)So, what can be done to combat rage bait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting. And remember that by sharing something outrageous you might be making things worse, while also making the creator richer.那么，可以做些什么来对抗愤怒诱饵呢？好吧，在做出反应之前，我们都可以花点时间思考一下。请记住，分享一些离谱的东西可能会让事情变得更糟，同时也会让创作者变得更富有。 Beth(贝丝)OK, Phil, let’s reveal the answer to your question. You asked me what ‘bait’ is.好的，Phil，让我们揭示你问题的答案。你问我什么是“诱饵”。 Phil(菲尔)I did. And the correct answer is b) food put on a hook to catch a fish or an animal, and isn’t that what you said, Beth?我做了。正确答案是 b） 把食物挂在钩子上以捕捉鱼或动物，贝丝，你不是这么说的吗？ Beth(贝丝)It is, yes.是的，是的。 Phil(菲尔)Right again! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in the programme, starting with rage bait, social media content designed to provoke anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it.又对了！好，让我们回顾一下我们在该计划中学到的词汇，从愤怒诱饵开始，社交媒体内容旨在激起愤怒，从而鼓励人们参与其中。 Beth(贝丝)The structure, the more… the more… describes the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.结构，越多…越…描述一件事反复发生导致另一件事也发生的情况。 Phil(菲尔)To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.To agite someone 的意思是鼓励他们做或感受不愉快或暴力的事情。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective, manipulative, describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.形容词 manipulative 描述了试图影响或控制某人以为自己谋取利益。 Phil(菲尔)Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television programme.Eyeballs 是一个非正式词，指的是观看特定网站或电视节目的人数。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!最后，偏见是感觉，通常是无意识的，支持或反对一个想法或一群人。我们的六分钟又结束了。再见！ Phil(菲尔)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】rage baitsocial media content designed to provoke an emotional reaction so that people engage with the content thereby generating income for the online creator愤怒诱饵旨在激起情绪反应的社交媒体内容，以便人们参与其中，从而为网络创作者带来收入。The inflammatory post was pure rage bait, designed to maximize engagement and profit.煽动性的帖子纯粹是愤怒诱饵，旨在最大限度地提高参与度和利润。 the more (X)… the more (Y)…as one thing (X) happens repeatedly, another thing (Y) happens more as a result越…越…一件事情(X)反复发生，另一件事情(Y)的结果就越多。The more he studied, the more confident he became in his abilities.他学习越多，就越自信。 inciteencourage someone to do or feel something unpleasant or violent; stir up; provoke; rouse煽动鼓励某人做或感受令人不快或暴力的事情；煽动；挑衅；激起。His inflammatory speech incited the mob to riot.他煽动性的演讲煽动了暴民暴动。 manipulativetrying to influence or control someone to your advantage操纵性的试图利用他人达到自己的目的。Her manipulative tactics alienated her friends.她操纵性的策略使她疏远了朋友。 eyeballsthe number of people viewing a particular website, television programme etc.眼球数观看特定网站、电视节目等的人数。The new campaign attracted millions of eyeballs.这项新活动吸引了数百万眼球。 biasesfeelings, often hidden or unconscious, either for or against an idea or a group of people偏见经常是隐藏的或无意识的，对某种想法或人群的偏好或偏见。Unconscious biases can significantly affect decision-making.无意识的偏见会严重影响决策。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】你能闻到家的味道吗？","path":"/2025/02/06/wechat-2025-02-06/","content":"【英文脚本】PhilHello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you? Maybe it’s sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window, or a loved family pet. What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil? PhilYou know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room. BethVery nice! PhilWell, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home: Marnie ChestertonMy grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books. Tristan AhtoneI know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap. BethIn this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too! PhilGood idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%? BethOh, I’m going to say b) 5%. PhilWell, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements: Tristan AhtoneOne thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there. BethTristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it. PhilThe truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements: Tristan AhtoneWell, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security. BethBy filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger. PhilEven though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home. BethRight, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question? PhilYes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think. BethIt is, yeah! PhilWell done! BethOK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell. PhilThe adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre. BethWhen someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen. PhilThe phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional. BethIf you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance. PhilAnd finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal.

What makes you feel like you’re home, Phil?我是贝丝。Phil，是什么让家对你来说很特别？也许是睡在自己的床上，窗外的风景，或者是心爱的家庭宠物。是什么让你感觉像在家一样，Phil？ Phil(菲尔)You know what? I think it’s just relaxing on my sofa, in my living room.你知道吗？我想就是在我的沙发上，在我的客厅里放松。 Beth(贝丝)Very nice!很好！ Phil(菲尔)Well, you may not realise it, but for your brain one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell. Listen as BBC presenters Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Ahtone describe the smells which give them the feeling of home:好吧，你可能没有意识到，但对于你的大脑来说，家最强的标志之一是气味。听听 BBC 主持人 Marnie Chesterton 和 Tristan Ahtone 描述给他们带来家的感觉的气味： Marnie Chesterton(玛妮·切斯特顿)My grandad’s house smelt of pine and damp and musty books.我爷爷的房子闻起来有松树的味道，还有潮湿和发霉的书籍的味道。 Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)I know my mom’s perfume, my dad’s preferred soap.我知道我妈妈的香水，我爸爸最喜欢的肥皂。 Beth(贝丝)In this programme, we’ll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to feeling at home, even when we don’t notice it. As always, we’ll be introducing some useful new vocabulary, and if you head over to our website, bbclearningenglish.com, you’ll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen, and there’s a free worksheet too!在这个节目中，我们将找出为什么我们的嗅觉对家的感觉如此重要，即使我们没有注意到它。与往常一样，我们将介绍一些有用的新词汇，如果您 bbclearningenglish.com 访问我们的网站，您会找到该程序的文字记录，供您在收听时阅读，并且还有一个免费的工作表！ Phil(菲尔)Good idea, Beth! But now it’s time for my question. The sense of smell is incredibly powerful but not everyone has it. A small amount of the population is anosmic, meaning they can’t smell. So, according to research at the University of Reading, what percentage of people have no sense of smell? Is it: a) 2%? b) 5%? or, c) 7%?好主意，贝丝！但现在是我提问的时候了。嗅觉非常强大，但并不是每个人都有。一小部分人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。那么，根据雷丁大学的研究，没有嗅觉的人占百分之几呢？是：a） 2%吗？b） 5%？或者，c） 7%？ Beth(贝丝)Oh, I’m going to say b) 5%.哦，我要说 b） 5%。 Phil(菲尔)Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house? If you have, don’t worry – it’s not bad, in fact there’s a scientific reason for it, as science writer Tristan Ahtone explained to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。你有没有放假回家，注意到家里有一股奇怪的气味？如果你有，别担心 —— 这还不错，事实上有科学原因，正如科学作家特里斯坦·阿通 （Tristan Ahtone） 对 BBC 国际服务节目《意想不到的元素》所解释的那样： Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)One thing I’ve been thinking about is that every house or home has, well, a smell to it. You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip, and you step through your front door and things smell, well, just kind of a bit weird. While there’s a good chance your house might smell strange because it’s been closed up for a few weeks, there’s also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells, but you just don’t notice it when you’re there.我一直在想的一件事是，每栋房子或每个家庭都有一股气味。当你从长途旅行回来时，你可能真的会在自己的家里注意到这一点，当你踏入前门时，东西闻起来有点奇怪。虽然您的房子很有可能因为已经关闭了几周而闻起来很奇怪，但您也有可能闻到家通常闻起来的味道，但当您在那里时，您只是没有注意到它。 Beth(贝丝)Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there’s a good chance your house smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual. If you say there’s a good chance that something will happen, you mean there’s a high likelihood or probability of it.特里斯坦说，当你离开后回到家时，你的房子很有可能闻起来很奇怪，这个形容词的意思是奇怪或不寻常。如果你说某事发生的可能性很大，你的意思是它发生的可能性很高。 Phil(菲尔)The truth is that every home has a smell, although we’re so used to it, we usually don’t notice. When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to olfactory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can’t smell your own home is that it isn’t a threat to you. Here’s science writer Tristan Ahtone again, explaining more to BBC World Service programme, Unexpected Elements:事实是，每个家都有气味，尽管我们已经习惯了，但我们通常不会注意到。当我们吸气时，鼻子中的受体细胞会检测到空气中的分子，并将它们发送到大脑中的嗅觉器官。这些分析气味是否存在危险。你闻不到自己家的原因是它对你没有威胁。这是科学作家 Tristan Ahtone 再次向 BBC 国际服务节目 Unexpected Elements 解释更多内容： Tristan Ahtone(特里斯坦·阿通)Well, by filtering out common non-threatening smells it makes it easier to detect things out of the ordinary that might be dangerous. So, for example, if you forget about your toast, and it starts to burn, you can typically smell that quickly because it’s a change to the environment that you’re in. Then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential harm or threat. But even if we can’t smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because it’s entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.好吧，通过过滤掉常见的非威胁性气味，可以更容易地检测到可能危险的异常事物。所以，例如，如果你忘记了吐司，它开始燃烧，你通常会很快闻到这种气味，因为这是你所处环境的变化。然后，您大脑的其他部分开始发挥作用，将烟味理解为潜在的伤害或威胁。但是，即使我们无法闻到自己家的气味，它们的气味仍然很重要，因为它与我们对舒适和安全的认识纠缠在一起。 Beth(贝丝)By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.通过过滤掉熟悉的气味，我们的大脑能够检测到其他不寻常、不寻常或不常见且可能很危险的气味。To filter something out 的意思是从其他事物中删除或分离不需要的事物。例如，过滤掉家的气味意味着我们会注意到烤面包燃烧的气味或其他气味，提醒我们可能的危险。 Phil(菲尔)Even though we don’t usually notice the scent – the particular smell – of our home, it still has an effect on the brain’s limbic system which handles memory and emotion. This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings, and why we feel comfortable and safe at home.尽管我们通常不会注意到家中的气味 —— 特殊的气味 —— 但它仍然对大脑处理记忆和情感的边缘系统产生影响。这就解释了为什么气味对我们的感受有如此强烈的影响，以及为什么我们在家里感到舒适和安全。 Beth(贝丝)Right, Phil, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?对，Phil，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Phil(菲尔)Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can’t smell. And the answer is b) 5% which is what you said, I think.是的，它是。我问你有多少百分比的人是嗅觉丧失症，这意味着他们没有气味。答案是 b） 5%，我想这就是你说的。 Beth(贝丝)It is, yeah!是的，是的！ Phil(菲尔)Well done!干的好！ Beth(贝丝)OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic, meaning having no sense, or a limited sense, of smell.好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的词汇，从嗅觉丧失开始，意思是没有嗅觉或嗅觉有限。 Phil(菲尔)The adjective weird means strange, odd or bizarre.形容词 weird 的意思是奇怪、奇怪或奇异。 Beth(贝丝)When someone says there’s a good chance something will happen, they mean it’s quite likely to happen.当有人说某事很有可能发生时，他们的意思是它很可能会发生。 Phil(菲尔)The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.短语 out of the ordinary 的意思是不寻常、不常见或例外。 Beth(贝丝)If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.如果你过滤掉一些东西，你就会从物质中去除或分离不需要的东西。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one although it can also mean the smell made by an animal. Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you enjoyed listening to this programme, you’ll find many more, along with a worksheet with a quiz you can try, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

We’ll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK who would like to become successful musicians, and we’ll even listen to some of their music too. PippaBut first, I have a question for you, Neil. In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best-selling songs in the country. And the top selling song is called the number one. But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs? a) The Beatles b) Ed Sheeran c) Elvis Presley NeilOh well, I think that’s easy. It must be, surely, The Beatles. PippaWell, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians. But if you want to become a musician, where do you start? Bailey TomkinsonI grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives. I was going to open mics from the age of about 11. NeilThis is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the south-west coast of England. She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age. Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music. PippaBailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home. Bailey TomkinsonI would go to these songwriters’ circles at the Kettle and Wink on, like, a Friday night after school where I’d be, like, the youngest person by, like, 50 years. But I’d sit in a circle with a bunch of old men, and they’d play James Taylor and Carole King and The Eagles and lots of 70s music, and I guess that’s influenced me massively. But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under their wing growing up. NeilWhen she was younger, Bailey went to songwriters’ circles. These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music. PippaBailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men. A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people. NeilThe older men in the group would play music from the 1970s, and Bailey says they took her under their wing. If you take somebody under your wing you decide to protect them or guide them. PippaLet’s meet another musician, Josh. Josh RobinsonSo, I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13. I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that. PippaJosh lives in London and is a busker. This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money. NeilBusking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people. And as Josh told BBC Learning English programme My Song, My Home, it can help musicians to get new opportunities. Josh RobinsonIt’s been kind of like my main earner that’s kept me going for the last ten or so years. From that, it’s then got me various different opportunities.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilLove it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth? BethErm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really. PhilWell, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful. BethIn this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases. PhilBut first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million? BethI’m going to go for b) 42,000. PhilOK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started: Adam ChandlerAt the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way. BethThe rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story. PhilIn the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results. BethWhich is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination. PhilThe success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal. BethBut not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik. Andie Sophia FontaineThere’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009. PhilIceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger. BethMcDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil. PhilYes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something. BethIf you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges. PhilThe American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard. BethThe adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time. PhilA take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it. BethAnd finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme. See you there soon! PhilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)I’m Phil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)Love it or hate it, there’s no doubt fast food is popular. Are you a fast food fan, Beth?不管你喜欢还是讨厌，毫无疑问，快餐很受欢迎。贝丝，你是快餐迷吗？ Beth(贝丝)Erm, not really, no. I think sometimes it can be quite convenient, obviously because it’s quick, but not really.呃，不是真的，不是。我认为有时它可能非常方便，显然是因为它很快，但并非真的。 Phil(菲尔)Well, whatever you think about them, fast food brands like KFC, Domino’s and, of course the big one, McDonald’s, are incredibly successful.好吧，无论你怎么看它们，像肯德基、达美乐，当然还有大麦当劳这样的快餐品牌，都取得了令人难以置信的成功。 Beth(贝丝)In this programme, we’ll be discussing the global spread of fast food from its beginnings in 1950s America. As usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.在本节目中，我们将讨论快餐从 1950 年代美国开始的全球传播。像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。 Phil(菲尔)But first, I have a question for you, Beth. Roughly how many fast food restaurants are there in the UK? Is it: a) 4,000? b) 42,000? or, c) four million?但首先，我有一个问题要问你，贝丝。英国大约有多少家快餐店？是：a） 4,000 个？b） 42,000 人？或者，c） 四百万？ Beth(贝丝)I’m going to go for b) 42,000.我要选 b） 42,000。 Phil(菲尔)OK, well later on we’ll find out the answer. In the United States, cheap and easy food like hamburgers, French fries and milkshakes have been popular since the 1950s. Listen as Adam Chandler, author of the book Drive-Thru Dreams, which traces the history of American fast food, tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how it all got started:好的，稍后我们会找出答案。在美国，自 1950 年代以来，汉堡包、炸薯条和奶昔等廉价易行的食物一直很受欢迎。请听亚当·钱德勒 （Adam Chandler） 讲述 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》（The Food Chain） 的故事，该书追溯了美国快餐的历史，该书的作者 Drive-Thru Dreams 讲述了这一切是如何开始的： Adam Chandler(亚当·钱德勒)At the heart of the story of fast food is a very ‘anyone can do this’ sense. A lot of the company founders didn’t have a college degree, who didn’t have a high school degree in a lot of instances, didn’t come from money, were oftentimes just people who were ready to plug themselves into a system that would work for them. And it did. It made opportunity very, very easy in a time when that was a new part of the American experience. So it was the American dream in a very small way, that became the American dream in a very big way.快餐故事的核心是一种非常 “任何人都可以做到 ”的感觉。许多公司创始人没有大学学位，在很多情况下没有高中学历，不是靠金钱赚钱的，他们通常只是准备将自己插入一个适合他们的系统的人。它确实做到了。在那个时代，机会变得非常、非常容易，因为这是美国经验的新部分。所以，在很小的方面，美国梦在很大程度上变成了美国梦。 Beth(贝丝)The rise of fast food reflected the rise of American economic power after the Second World War. When Adam says that this lies at the heart of the story, he means it’s the most important part of the story.快餐的兴起反映了二战后美国经济实力的崛起。当 Adam 说这是故事的核心时，他的意思是这是故事中最重要的部分。 Phil(菲尔)In the 1950s, when the famous brands we know today were just beginning, anyone with a can-do attitude could sell fast food. A can-do attitude describes someone who is confident and determined to fix problems and achieve results.在 1950 年代，当我们今天所知道的著名品牌刚刚起步时，任何具有积极进取的态度的人都可以销售快餐。“我能行”的态度描述了一个有信心并决心解决问题并取得成果的人。 Beth(贝丝)Which is exactly what happened at successful restaurants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald’s. For many, these fast food brands symbolised The American dream - the idea that anyone in the United States can achieve success through hard work and determination.这正是 Kentucky Fried Chicken 和 McDonald’s 等成功餐厅发生的事情。对许多人来说，这些快餐品牌象征着美国梦 —— 即在美国，任何人都可以通过努力工作和决心取得成功。 Phil(菲尔)The success of KFC, McDonald’s and the rest wasn’t limited to America. Nowadays, you can visit two McDonald’s on opposite sides of the planet and eat exactly the same meal.肯德基、麦当劳和其他公司的成功不仅限于美国。如今，您可以参观地球两侧的两家麦当劳，并吃完全相同的饭菜。 Beth(贝丝)But not every country opened its arms in welcome – the tiny island of Iceland for one. Andie Sophia Fontaine, who used to work in McDonald’s, now edits The Iceland Review. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, how McDonald’s got a frosty reception when it started selling burgers in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.但并不是每个国家都张开怀抱欢迎 —— 冰岛这个小岛就是其中之一。安迪·索菲亚·方丹 （Andie Sophia Fontaine） 曾经在麦当劳工作，现在是《冰岛评论》的编辑。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain，当麦当劳开始在冰岛首都雷克雅未克销售汉堡时，它受到了冷遇。 Andie Sophia Fontaine(安迪·索菲亚·方丹)There’s been a long-standing burger culture in Iceland. They have their own take on the hamburger wherein they’ll use lettuce, and raw cucumbers, and a type of fry sauce - that’s called a shalpuborgari, or a shop burger, and that’s been around for ages. Yeah, so McDonald’s - they struggled to try to maintain a market. The final nail in the coffin was the global financial crisis in 2008&#x2F;2009.冰岛的汉堡文化由来已久。他们对汉堡包有自己的想法，他们将使用生菜、生黄瓜和一种炸酱 —— 称为 shalpuborgari，或商店汉堡，已经存在了很长时间。是的，所以麦当劳 —— 他们努力维持市场。棺材上的最后一枚钉子是 2008&#x2F;2009 年的全球金融危机。 Phil(菲尔)Iceland already had a long-standing tradition of eating burgers – a tradition that had existed for a long time. For example, the shalpuborgari, or shop burger, was a take on – or variation of – the American hamburger.冰岛已经有吃汉堡的悠久传统 —— 这一传统已经存在了很长时间。例如，shalpuborgari 或商店汉堡是美国汉堡包的变体。 Beth(贝丝)McDonald’s weren’t as successful in Iceland as they’d been elsewhere. And the global financial crash of 2008 was the final nail in the coffin, an event which caused the failure of something that had already started to go wrong. To this day there are no McDonald’s in Iceland, unlike Britain, which reminds me of your question, Phil.麦当劳在冰岛并不像其他地方那样成功。而 2008 年的全球金融危机是棺材上的最后一枚钉子，这一事件导致了已经开始出错的事情的失败。直到今天，冰岛还没有麦当劳，不像英国，这让我想起了你的问题，菲尔。 Phil(菲尔)Yes. I asked you how many fast food restaurants there are in Britain. I asked you if there were 4,000, 42,000 or four million. And of course, the answer is 42,000 so you were right, well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned, starting with at the heart of, meaning the most important part, or the cause, of something.是的。我问你英国有多少家快餐店。我问你是 4,000 人、42,000 人还是 400 万人。当然，答案是 42,000 个，所以你是对的，干得好！好，让我们回顾一下我们学到的词汇，从核心开始，意思是某事最重要的部分或原因。 Beth(贝丝)If you say that someone has a can-do attitude, you mean they are confident to take action, fix problems and deal with new challenges.如果你说某人有“我能行”的态度，你的意思是他们有信心采取行动、解决问题和应对新的挑战。 Phil(菲尔)The American dream is the belief that everyone in the USA has the opportunity to be successful and happy if they work hard.美国梦是相信如果努力工作，美国每个人都有机会获得成功和快乐。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective, long-standing, means having existed for a long time.这个形容词 long-based 的意思是已经存在了很长时间。 Phil(菲尔)A take on something means a variation, or new way of presenting it.对某物的接受意味着一种变体，或一种新的呈现方式。 Beth(贝丝)And finally, the idiom, the final nail in the coffin, refers to an event that causes the final end of something that had already started to fail. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not head over to the BBC Learning English website where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz especially for this programme.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilSo, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best? BethI think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world. PhilWell, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings. BethThe rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’. Sean CoughlanWhen they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’. PhilSean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries. BethPhil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK? PhilI think it might be b) Ireland. BethOK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings. Sean CoughlanThey’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it. PhilWe heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace. BethWe use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically. PhilWe also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering. BethSo, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal. Sean CoughlanCountries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well. Rando KuustikIf you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful. PhilSean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem. BethRando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart. PhilSo, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries? BethI asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial. PhilIf you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are. BethRivals are competitors. PhilA knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering. BethIf something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening. PhilAnd finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to visit our website, bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find a worksheet and quiz related to this programme, and we’ll see you again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now! BethBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Phil(菲尔)I’m Phil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是菲尔。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是贝丝。 Phil(菲尔)So, Beth, we’re talking about the best education systems in the world today. You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?所以，贝丝，我们谈论的是当今世界上最好的教育系统。你在英国上学。您如何看待英国的教育体系？你认为这可能是最好的吗？ Beth(贝丝)I think it’s quite good, there’s probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it’s quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.我认为它相当不错，我个人可能会改变它的一些事情，但我想说它相当不错，但可能不是世界上最好的。 Phil(菲尔)Well, in this programme, we are going to be talking about the Pisa rankings.好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论 Pisa 排名。 Beth(贝丝)The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD, that’s an international organisation, every three years. These tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading. But is that really possible to measure? Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’.该排名基于经合组织（OECD）每三年进行的一次测试。这些测试试图显示哪些国家在数学、科学和阅读教学方面最有效。但这真的可以衡量吗？嗯，这是前 BBC 教育记者肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 与 BBC 世界服务节目“全球故事”的对话。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)When they were introduced first of all, that was a very contentious idea, because people said ‘how can you possibly compare big countries… how can you compare America to Luxembourg or to, you know, or to parts of China, or whatever?’.当它们第一次被引入时，这是一个非常有争议的想法，因为人们说’你怎么可能比较大国……你怎么能把美国与卢森堡或中国的部分地区，或者其他什么地方进行比较呢？ Phil(菲尔)Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it is something that people might argue about – it’s controversial. So, at first, Pisa tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.肖恩说，这些测试是有争议的。如果某件事是有争议的，那么它就是人们可能会争论的事情 —— 它是有争议的。因此，起初，比萨测试是有争议的，因为不是每个人都认为比较非常不同的国家是公平的。 Beth(贝丝)Phil, I’ve got a question for you about them. So, in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings. But which of these countries came second? Was it: a) The USA? b) Ireland? or, c) The UK?Phil，我有一个关于他们的问题要问你。因此，在 2022 年，新加坡在阅读排名中名列前茅。但这些国家中哪些位居第二呢？是：a） 美国？b） 爱尔兰？或者，c） 英国？ Phil(菲尔)I think it might be b) Ireland.我想可能是 b） 爱尔兰。 Beth(贝丝)OK. Well, we will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. A common pattern in the Pisa rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller. Talking to BBC World Service programme ‘The Global Story’, Sean Coughlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don’t score that highly in the rankings.还行。好吧，我们将在节目结束时发现这是否正确。比萨排名的一个常见模式是，最成功的国家往往规模较小。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 在接受 BBC 国际频道节目“全球故事”采访时告诉我们，许多西欧大国在排名中的得分并不高。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)They’re being outpaced and outperformed by these fast, upcoming countries – you know, Singapore, or Estonia, or Taiwan, or those sort of places which we don’t historically think of as being economic rivals, but I suppose the argument for the PISA tests is, if you want to have a knowledge economy, an economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.他们被这些快速崛起的国家超越和超越 —— 你知道的，新加坡、爱沙尼亚、台湾，或者那些我们历史上不认为是经济竞争对手的地方，但我想 PISA 测试的论点是，如果你想拥有一种知识经济，一种基于技能的经济，这就是你衡量它的方式。 Phil(菲尔)We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations. If someone outpaces you, they are going faster than you – at a higher pace.我们听说许多欧洲大国正在被小国超越。如果有人超过你，他们就会比你走得更快 —— 速度更高。 Beth(贝丝)We use the prefix ‘out-‘ to say that someone or something is better at doing something. We also heard that smaller nations are ‘outperforming’ larger ones – they are performing better. Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations – that means that they are competing with them, economically.我们使用前缀 ‘out-‘ 来表示某人或某事更擅长做某事。我们还听说，小国“跑赢”大国 —— 它们的表现更好。新加坡、爱沙尼亚和台湾被描述为欧洲大国的经济竞争对手 —— 这意味着它们在经济上正在与这些国家竞争。 Phil(菲尔)We also heard about a knowledge economy. This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.我们还听说了知识经济。这是一个以服务行业为基础的经济，这些行业要求工人受过高等教育，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。 Beth(贝丝)So, what makes countries perform better in these tests? Let’s hear again from BBC World Service programme, ‘The Global Story’. Sean Coughlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well. We also hear from Rando Kuustik, an Estonian school principal.那么，是什么让各国在这些测试中表现得更好呢？让我们再次聆听 BBC 国际服务节目“全球故事”。肖恩·考夫兰 （Sean Coughlan） 告诉我们，那些优先考虑让每个人都达到一定水平的国家做得很好。我们还听取了爱沙尼亚学校校长 Rando Kuustik 的发言。 Sean Coughlan(肖恩·考夫兰)Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard, regardless of their background, do well.确保所有学生都能接受一定水平的教育达到一定标准的国家，无论他们的背景如何，都做得很好。 Rando Kuustik(兰多·库斯蒂克)If you are teaching them by different level or abilities, then you are segregating them and we don’t want to segregate any people in the world, why we are doing that in the schools? This one of the main things why Estonia is successful.如果你用不同的水平或能力来教他们，那么你就是在隔离他们，我们不想把世界上的任何人都隔离开来，为什么我们在学校里这样做呢？这是爱沙尼亚成功的主要原因之一。 Phil(菲尔)Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard, regardless of their background. If one thing happens regardless of something else, it means that the something else is not important, or not a problem.Sean 说，最成功的系统将每个人都教育到特定的标准，无论他们的背景如何。如果一件事发生而不考虑其他事情，这意味着其他事情不重要，或者不是问题。 Beth(贝丝)Rando Kuustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students. Segregate means to separate and keep apart.兰多·库斯蒂克 （Rando Kuustik） 说，爱沙尼亚的学校不想隔离学生。隔离的意思是分离和保持分离。 Phil(菲尔)So, we’ve just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth? What about those countries?那么，我们刚刚听说了爱沙尼亚，但贝丝，您的问题呢？那些国家呢？ Beth(贝丝)I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland, and the UK came second for reading in the 2022 Pisa rankings. You said Ireland, and that was the correct answer. Well done! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about education rankings, starting with contentious - argued about or controversial.我问你，在 2022 年 Pisa 排名中，美国、爱尔兰和英国的阅读量排名第二。你说的是爱尔兰，这是正确的答案。干的好！好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个课程中学到的关于教育排名的词汇，从有争议的 - 争论的或有争议的开始。 Phil(菲尔)If you’re outpaced by someone, they are going faster than you are.如果你被某人超越，他们就会比你走得更快。 Beth(贝丝)Rivals are competitors.竞争对手就是竞争对手。 Phil(菲尔)A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.知识经济是一种基于需要受过高等教育的工人的行业，例如 IT、金融或高级工程。 Beth(贝丝)If something happens regardless of a second thing, the second thing has no impact on it happening.如果某件事发生，而不考虑第二件事，那么第二件事对它的发生没有影响。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. PhilMost people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life. What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth? BethOh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you? PhilI ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious! BethOh, OK. Good!

Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself: David ShirleyI had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years. PhilDavid tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently. BethA 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables? PhilOh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer. BethOK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old: Fuchsia DunlopIn China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer. PhilCooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years. BethWow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling. PhilProfessor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages: Prof Martha CarlinIn theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time. BethHaving hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made. PhilStarting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question? BethAh, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time. PhilWhen food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently. BethThe verb replenish means to fill something up again. PhilIf something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true. BethWhen you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made. PhilAnd finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort. Once again, our six minutes are up.

What’s the most unusual thing you’ve ever eaten, Beth?大多数人一生中至少吃过一次不寻常的食物。贝丝，你吃过的最不寻常的东西是什么？ Beth(贝丝)Oh, I ate camel in Australia, and I really didn’t like it, to be honest. What about you?哦，我在澳大利亚吃过骆驼，说实话，我真的不喜欢它。你呢？ Phil(菲尔)I ate caiman in Northern Argentina, and it was delicious!我在阿根廷北部吃了凯门鳄，很好吃！ Beth(贝丝)Oh, OK. Good!哦，好的，很好！ Phil(菲尔)Well, in this programme we’ll be discussing some very unusual food known as ‘forever food’ – dishes, like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year. We’ll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download, along with a worksheet for this programme, at our website, bbclearningenglish.com.好吧，在这个节目中，我们将讨论一些非常不寻常的食物，被称为 “永恒的食物”–像炖菜和汤一样的菜肴，可以日复一日，年复一年地保持下去。我们还将学习一些有用的新词汇，所有这些词汇都可以在我们的网站上下载，以及该节目的工作表，bbclearningenglish.com。 Beth(贝丝)But let’s get back to forever food, and a Bangkok restaurant called, Wattana Panich, that’s famous for a soup which has been cooking for over 50 years! Here’s radio listener, David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, after tasting the soup himself:但是让我们回到永恒的食物，一家名为 Wattana Panich 的曼谷餐厅，它以已经烹饪了 50 多年的汤而闻名！这是电台听众大卫·雪莉 在亲自品尝了汤后致电 BBC 世界服务节目 The Food Chain： David Shirley(大卫·雪莉)I had never heard of a perpetual stew before, but the first time I’d ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok. I found a stew that had been simmering for fifty years.我以前从未听说过永久炖菜，但我第一次听说它是在曼谷的时候。我找到了一个炖了五十年的炖菜。 Phil(菲尔)David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously. The pot is never completely emptied. Instead, new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering – cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.大卫尝到了永久炖菜的味道，这是一个将食材放入其中并不断烹饪的锅。这个罐子永远不会完全清空。相反，必要时加入新的成分和水并炖着 —— 在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，使食物轻轻冒泡。 Beth(贝丝)A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone’s taste, but forever foods are surprisingly common. And, Phil, I have a question for you about Wattana Panich’s 50-year-old soup. What do you think is the main ingredient? Is it: a) beef? b) chicken? or, c) vegetables?50 年的汤可能并不符合每个人的口味，但永恒的食物却出奇地普遍。菲尔，我有一个关于 Wattana Panich 的 50 年老汤的问题要问你。您认为主要成分是什么？是：a） 牛肉？b） 鸡肉？或者，c） 蔬菜？ Phil(菲尔)Oh, I think vegetables. I think that’s probably safer.哦，我想是蔬菜。我认为这可能更安全。 Beth(贝丝)OK. Well, we’ll find out the correct answer later in the programme. It’s not just Bangkok where people cook forever foods. Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food. Here, she tells BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old:还行。好吧，我们将在节目的后面找到正确答案。不仅仅是曼谷，人们永远烹饪食物。Fuchsia Dunlop 是一位作家和厨师，专门研究中餐。在这里，她告诉 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”，关于一种据传已有 100 年历史的中国炖菜： Fuchsia Dunlop(紫红色邓禄普)In China they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a bǎinián laolu which means, like, a 100-year-old-broth. So, I don’t know if this is strictly true, but theoretically as long as you have a good practice of hygiene - which is to say that you always skim it, and boil it every day, and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices, and you know, you keep tasting - then it just gets richer and richer.在中国，专业人士有时会谈论 bǎinián laolu，意思是，就像 100 年的肉汤一样。所以，我不知道这是否严格来说是正确的，但从理论上讲，只要你有良好的卫生习惯 —— 也就是说，你总是撇去它，每天煮它，并根据需要补充更多的水、更多的盐、更多的香料，你知道，你不断品尝 —— 那么它就会变得越来越丰富。 Phil(菲尔)Cooks need to replenish a forever stew, to fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it’s completely eaten. By being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.厨师需要补充永远的炖菜，在完全食用之前再次用新鲜食材填满。通过定期补充，有传言称有些菜肴可以使用 100 年。 Beth(贝丝)Wow, that is a long time! Fuchsia doesn’t know if it’s strictly true, or completely true, that the same stew has really lasted 100 years, but she thinks it’s possible in theory, as long as it’s kept safe and hygienic through boiling.哇，好好长的时间啊！Fuchsia 不知道同样的炖菜真的持续了 100 年是严格正确的还是完全正确的，但她认为理论上是可能的，只要它在煮沸时保持安全和卫生。 Phil(菲尔)Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery. Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme, ‘The Food Chain’, why long- lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages:玛莎·卡林 教授是一位历史学家，对中世纪烹饪特别感兴趣。在这里，她向 BBC 世界服务节目“食物链”解释了为什么中世纪的人们会熟悉长效食物： Prof Martha Carlin(Martha Carlin 教授)In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn’t have matches or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process, would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that, and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire, and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.从理论上讲，认为没有火柴或点火器的人是有道理的，对他们来说从头开始生火是一个相当繁琐的过程，如果他们有办法的话，自然会希望让炖锅冒泡，并避免不断点火的劳动。 还要确保他们随时都有热饭等着他们。 Beth(贝丝)Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something ready to eat, and avoids having to start a fire from scratch. When you do something, like cook food or make a fire, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without the help of anything that has already been made.让热食在火上冒泡意味着总有现成的东西可以吃，并且不必从头开始生火。当你从头开始做某事时，比如做饭或生火，你从头开始做，不需要任何已经完成的帮助。 Phil(菲尔)Starting a fire is also cumbersome, an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort. But Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood to keep a fire going all day. Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth, so what was the answer to your question?生火也很麻烦，这个形容词的意思是很难做到，需要时间和精力。但卡林教授说，只有富裕家庭才能买得起足够的木材来维持一整天的火势。不管怎样，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我饿了，贝丝，那么你的问题的答案是什么？ Beth(贝丝)Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew, and you said vegetables. And I’m afraid that’s wrong. It was, in fact, beef. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned in this programme about forever foods such as perpetual stew, a pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added, allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.啊，我问你曼谷炖菜的主要成分是什么，你说蔬菜。恐怕这是错误的。事实上，它是牛肉。好，让我们回顾一下我们在这个节目中学到的关于永恒食物的词汇，比如永久炖菜，一锅炖菜，定期添加新成分，让这道菜可以长时间食用。 Phil(菲尔)When food is simmering, it’s cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling so that it bubbles gently.当食物炖煮时，它会在略低于沸腾的温度下烹饪，以便轻轻冒泡。 Beth(贝丝)The verb replenish means to fill something up again.动词 replenish 的意思是再次填充某物。 Phil(菲尔)If something is not strictly true, it’s not completely or entirely true.如果某件事不是严格正确的，那么它就不完全或完全正确。 Beth(贝丝)When you do an activity such as cooking, from scratch, you do it from the beginning, without using anything that has already been made.当您从头开始进行烹饪等活动时，您可以从头开始进行，而无需使用已经制作的任何产品。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, if an activity is cumbersome, it’s difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil. BethAnd I’m Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough. How much water do you drink a day, Phil? PhilOh, I don’t know. Maybe about a litre? BethOK. And do you know how much water you should drink a day? PhilI think it’s probably about two litres. BethAh, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water - over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as well. PhilAnd speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme, plus worksheet exercises to help you learn them, on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. BethGreat! But first I have a question for you, Phil. I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water, but there’s an even higher percentage of water in our blood. But how much? Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water? PhilI think it’s around 80% water. BethOK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman: Professor John SpeakmanSo, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water. PhilProfessor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it. BethYes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’. PhilWhat Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct. BethActually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size. PhilBut what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain. Dr Nidia Rodriguez-SanchezAnd also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration. PhilDr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition. BethSo, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations. PhilIf an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it. BethThe phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate. PhilA ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.

And do you know how much water you should drink a day?还行。你知道你每天应该喝多少水吗？ Phil(菲尔)I think it’s probably about two litres.我想大概是两升。 Beth(贝丝)Ah, well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day.

Is our blood: a) around 80% water? b) around 90% water? or, c) 100% water?太好了！但首先我有一个问题要问你，Phil。我提到过，人体的一半以上由水组成，但我们血液中的水比例甚至更高。但多少呢？我们的血液是否：a） 大约 80% 是水？b） 大约 90% 的水？或者，c） 100% 水？ Phil(菲尔)I think it’s around 80% water.我认为大约 80% 是水。 Beth(贝丝)OK, I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme. Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body’s cells and organs. The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day. But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, is biologist, Professor John Speakman:好的，我将在稍后的节目中透露正确答案。我们的血液需要水，这样才能将营养物质输送到身体的细胞和器官。建议的量通常为每天 2 升。但是为什么？在这里与 BBC 世界服务节目《食物链》讨论这个问题的是生物学家约翰·斯皮克曼教授： Professor John Speakman(John Speakman 教授)So, I’m not sure how it was arrived at but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries. So, if you look at government recommendations around the world, they’re pretty much all the same. They pretty much all say everybody’s got to be drinking two litres of water.所以，我不确定它是如何得出的，但这个数字似乎已经控制了非常多的国家。所以，如果你看一下世界各地的政府建议，它们几乎都是一样的。他们几乎都说每个人都必须喝两升水。 Phil(菲尔)Professor Speakman doesn’t know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at – how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something, you mean it’s taken control of it.Speakman 教授不知道每天 2 升的水数是如何得出的 —— 它是如何决定或计算的。尽管如此，每天喝两升的想法已经影响了世界各地的许多政府。当你说一个想法已经抓住了某件事时，你的意思是它已经控制了它。 Beth(贝丝)Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same recommendation. He uses the phrase, pretty much, to mean almost. For example, ‘pretty much all governments advise drinking two litres a day’ means ‘almost all governments advise it’.是的，斯皮克曼教授说，几乎所有政府都给出了几乎相同的建议。他用这个词，几乎是，意思几乎。例如，“几乎所有政府都建议每天喝两升”的意思是“几乎所有政府都建议这样做”。 Phil(菲尔)What Professor Speakman doesn’t have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice. The number of exactly two litres isn’t based on scientific fact, it’s more of a ballpark figure – a number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.然而，斯皮克曼教授没有为这个建议提供任何科学证据。正好 2 升的数字不是基于科学事实，它更像是一个大概的数字 —— 一个猜测的数字，但你仍然相信它大致正确。 Beth(贝丝)Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time. Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time, when you breathe, sweat, or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.实际上，我们体内的水量一直在变化。就像你花钱时银行余额会下降一样，当你呼吸、出汗或上厕所时，你的身体会一直流失水分。你到底需要喝多少水取决于你的身体需要补充多少水，而这主要取决于你的体型。 Phil(菲尔)But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here’s hydration expert, Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez, describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain.但是，当我们喝得少于我们应该喝的少时会发生什么呢？这是补水专家 Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 博士向 BBC 国际频道的 The Food Chain 描述脱水的影响。 Dr Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez(Nidia Rodriguez-Sanchez 医师)And also, many times we start getting dehydrated and we don’t realise we are dehydrated. So it’s very common that we feel tired, or we feel, like, with a bit of a headache, or even we think we’re hungry, and we go and get some food. And actually what is happening is that we are thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we are starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.而且，很多时候我们开始脱水，但我们没有意识到我们脱水了。因此，我们感到疲倦，或者我们感到有点头痛，甚至我们认为我们饿了，然后我们去吃点东西，这是很常见的。实际上，我们正在发生的事情是我们口渴，我们脱水，我们开始出现一些脱水的迹象或症状。 Phil(菲尔)Dr Sanchez describes the effects of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth as symptoms of dehydration. Symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence of some illness or condition.Sanchez 博士描述了脱水的影响，脱水是指体内水分不足，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。她提到感到疲倦、头痛或口干是脱水的症状。症状是体内显示存在某种疾病或病症的迹象或感觉。 Beth(贝丝)So, whether you drink a little more, or a little less, it seems that around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy. Speaking of which, Phil, it’s time to reveal the answer to my question, what percentage of our blood is water? You said 80%, and the answer is 90%. Our blood consists of around 90% water. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number, meaning to decide it by doing calculations.因此，无论您多喝一点还是少喝一点，每天喝两升左右的水似乎都是保持血液和身体健康的好方法。说到这里，Phil，是时候揭示我问题的答案了，我们血液中有多少百分比是水？你说 80%，答案是 90%。我们的血液由大约 90% 的水组成。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的词汇，从短语开始得出一个数字，意思是通过计算来决定它。 Phil(菲尔)If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control of it.如果一个想法抓住了某件事，它就会控制它。 Beth(贝丝)The phrase pretty much means almost; for example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate, which means almost everyone likes chocolate.这个短语的意思是几乎；例如，几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力，这意味着几乎每个人都喜欢巧克力。 Phil(菲尔)A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which is an acceptably accurate approximation.一个大概的数字是一个短语，意思是一个数字，这是一个可以接受的准确近似值。 Beth(贝丝)Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in your body so that you feel ill or weak.脱水是指体内没有足够的水分，以至于您感到不适或虚弱的情况。 Phil(菲尔)And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body showing the presence of an illness or condition.

I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend. NeilWhat was the voice? BethHello? NeilOh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about. BethYes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences. NeilIn this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases. BethSo, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ? NeilSo I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%. BethOK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme. As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if thedifference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health: Dr Vanessa ApeaSo they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really. NeilMany people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination. BethFor some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends. NeilThere are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health: James GallagherCan you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease? Dr Vanessa ApeaI bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues. BethJames asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone. NeilAs well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question? BethIt is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil? NeilYes, I think I said c) 61%. BethI’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time. NeilTo diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient. BethIf you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help. NeilThe phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed. BethThe adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else. NeilAnd finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not built your vocabulary and listening skills even more with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme? They’re both available now on our website, bbclearningenglish.com. See you there! BethBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)I’m Neil.你好。这是来自 BBC Learning English 的六分钟英语。我是 Neil。 Beth(贝丝)And I’m Beth.我是 Beth。 Neil(尼尔)Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed – that self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red and you wish you could just disappear.很多事情都会让我们感到尴尬 —— 当你的脸涨红，你希望自己能消失时，那种自我意识、不舒服的感觉。 Beth(贝丝)Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?你有没有经历过尴尬的时刻，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, many. Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car and I waved my hands around in a very silly way. But unfortunately, I soon discovered that it wasn’t my parents. It was another couple.是的，很多。有一次我在停车场遇到了我的父母，我看到他们开着他们的车来了，我以一种非常愚蠢的方式挥了挥手。但不幸的是，我很快发现那不是我的父母。那是另一对。 Beth(贝丝)Oh no, that’s really embarrassing. I remember answering the phone, I thought it was my best friend and I said ‘hello’ in a very silly voice, and then they asked to speak to my dad, and it wasn’t my friend.哦，不，这真的很尴尬。我记得接电话时，我以为是我最好的朋友，我用非常愚蠢的声音说了一声“你好”，然后他们要求和我爸爸说话，但那不是我的朋友。 Neil(尼尔)What was the voice?声音是什么？ Beth(贝丝)Hello?你好？ Neil(尼尔)Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing. When it comes to our health, there’s no end of things to be embarrassed about.哦，天哪。但尴尬不仅仅是害羞和脸红。当谈到我们的健康时，有无穷无尽的事情值得尴尬。 Beth(贝丝)Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed that they don’t go to see a doctor when they should, sometimes with serious consequences.是的，有些人感到非常尴尬，以至于他们没有在应该去看医生的时候去看医生，有时会带来严重的后果。 Neil(尼尔)In this programme we’ll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment, and as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new words and phrases.在这个节目中，我们将讨论医疗尴尬的问题，像往常一样，我们将学习一些有用的新单词和短语。 Beth(贝丝)So, I have a question. Neil, according to the UK’s Nursing Times newspaper, what percentage of people surveyed said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment, and then later been diagnosed with a health condition? Was it: a) 21% ? b) 41% ? or, c) 61% ?所以，我有一个问题。Neil，据英国《护理时报》报道，有多少百分比的受访者表示他们因尴尬而推迟了去看医生，后来又被诊断出患有健康状况？是：a） 21% ？b） 41% ？或者，c） 61% ？ Neil(尼尔)So I think it’s probably a lot. So c) 61%.所以我认为这可能很多。所以 c） 61%。 Beth(贝丝)OK. We will find out if that’s correct at the end of the programme.还行。我们将在节目结束时找出这是否正确。 As humans we get embarrassed if we feel different from others, especially if the(作为人类，如果我们觉得自己与他人不同，我们会感到尴尬，尤其是当)difference is physical. But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition impact our relationship with the doctor? Here’s Dr Vanessa Apea, consultant in sexual health at Barts Hospital in London, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:差异是物理的。但是，对医疗状况感到尴尬如何影响我们与医生的关系呢？以下是伦敦巴茨医院性健康顾问 Vanessa Apea 博士对 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的更多解释： Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)So they’ll delay accessing the clinic, and also seeking treatment, and so then you’ll often see people that could have been diagnosed with what’s happening much earlier, and could have had earlier intervention, but it’s delayed quite significantly. And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence really.因此，他们会延迟进入诊所和寻求治疗，因此你经常会看到一些人，他们本来可以更早地被诊断出患有正在发生的事情，并且可能更早地接受了干预，但延迟了相当多。所以我觉得我们看到很多人真的在默默地忍受痛苦。 Neil(尼尔)Many people delay going to the doctor – they postpone going or put it off until a later time. As a result, their problem isn’t diagnosed. To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.许多人延迟去看医生 —— 他们推迟去看医生或推迟到以后。因此，他们的问题没有得到诊断。To diagnose 是指通过医学检查来识别疾病或健康问题。 Beth(贝丝)For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong they prefer to suffer in silence – to struggle with pain without seeking help - rather than visit the doctor. But fortunately, there are things you can do to help. Writing your problem down, going with a friend, and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Apea recommends.对一些人来说，尴尬的感觉是如此强烈，他们宁愿默默忍受 —— 在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦作斗争 —— 也不愿去看医生。但幸运的是，您可以做一些事情来提供帮助。写下你的问题，和朋友一起去，去看你信任的医生是 Apea 医生推荐的一些想法。 Neil(尼尔)There are ways that doctors can help as well, as Dr Vanessa Apea explains here to James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health:医生也可以通过多种方式提供帮助，正如 Vanessa Apea 博士在这里向 BBC Radio 4 节目 Inside Health 的主持人 James Gallagher 解释的那样： James Gallagher(詹姆斯·加拉格尔)Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?您能告诉我们您用了什么技巧来让人们放心吗？ Dr Vanessa Apea(Vanessa Apea 医师)I bring transparency to the conversation, and own it, and say that I’m going to be asking you some quite personal questions, and there may be also intimate examination… I want to assure you that this is confidential, that this is a safe, non- judgmental space… So really, I often name the words to create that space as well. Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.我为对话带来透明度，并拥有它，并说我将问你一些非常私人的问题，也可能有亲密的检查……我想向你保证，这是保密的，这是一个安全、不带评判的空间……所以说真的，我也经常说出创造那个空间的词。我希望，也要以我的方式，以及我的非语言暗示。 Beth(贝丝)James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease – to make them feel calm and relaxed - and Dr Apea describes her ideal conversation: it’s a safe space, it’s non-judgmental and what is said is confidential, kept private and not shared with anyone.詹姆斯问医生可以做些什么来让人们放松 —— 让他们感到平静和放松 —— Apea 医生描述了她理想的对话：这是一个安全的空间，不带评判，所说的是保密的，保密的，不与任何人分享。 Neil(尼尔)As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively, Dr Apea also uses non- verbal cues - the expression on her face, her hand movements, and the tone of her voice, rather than words, to communicate and relax the patient. Embarrassment is normal, and with support hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor despite it. OK, Beth, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question?除了敏感地讨论令人尴尬的问题外，Apea 医生还使用非语言暗示 - 她脸上的表情、她的手部动作和她的语气，而不是语言，来与患者交流和放松。尴尬是正常的，在支持下，希望我们中的更多人会感到放心去看医生。好的，贝丝，现在是不是该透露你问题的答案了？ Beth(贝丝)It is. I asked you: What percentage of people said they had delayed visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed, but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition? Do you remember what you said, Neil?是的。我问你：有多少百分比的人说他们因为尴尬而推迟去看医生，但后来被诊断出患有健康状况？你还记得你说过的话吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I think I said c) 61%.是的，我想我说的是 c） 61%。 Beth(贝丝)I’m afraid that is not the correct answer. It was, in fact a) 21% or just over a fifth. OK, let’s recap the new vocabulary we’ve used, starting with delay, to postpone or put off until a later time.恐怕这不是正确的答案。事实上，它是 a） 21% 或略高于五分之一。好，让我们回顾一下我们使用的新词汇，从 delay 开始，推迟或推迟到以后。 Neil(尼尔)To diagnose a disease or medical condition means to identify it by recognising the symptoms and examining the patient.To diagnose a disease or medical condition 的意思是通过识别症状和检查患者来识别它。 Beth(贝丝)If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle with painful feelings without asking someone for help.如果你默默忍受，你会忍受痛苦的感觉，并在不寻求帮助的情况下与痛苦的感受作斗争。 Neil(尼尔)The phrasal verb put someone at ease means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.短语动词 put someone at ease 的意思是让某人感到平静和放松。 Beth(贝丝)The adjective confidential means kept private and secret and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.形容词 confidential 的意思是保密和秘密，并描述不与其他任何人共享的信息。 Neil(尼尔)And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice, rather than speech, to show your feelings.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob. DanAnd I’m Dan. RobNow, do you know who Michelle Obama is? DanEr, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America. RobThat is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan? Dan th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century. RobOK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before? BBC News ReportThe former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady. Rob So, where did she revisit on this trip? DanShe went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved. RobThe report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing. DanOne of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position. RobThere is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do. DanI get that feeling all the time! RobI wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us. DanWell, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves. RobLet’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities. Michelle ObamaThat’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in. RobShe says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’. DanShe uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with. Rob Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said? DanI thought it was the 20th Century. RobWell, you were right. DanYay! Robth But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary. DanWe started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject. RobThen there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities. Dan The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired. RobNext there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’. DanThe next phrase was in their own right. If someone is successful in their own right, for example, it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities, and not because of who they work for, or work with or which social group they come from. RobAnd finally there was the noun phrase station in life. DanYour station in life is your position in society – your social status. RobAnd that brings us to the end of this week’s programme. We’ll be back soon and in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our app and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye bye for now. DanBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Rob(罗伯)Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 罗伯。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan.我是 Dan。 Rob(罗伯)Now, do you know who Michelle Obama is?现在，你知道米歇尔·奥巴马是谁吗？ Dan(担)Er, yes. Maybe the most famous woman in the world? Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.呃，是的。也许是世界上最著名的女性？前第一夫人，这意味着她是美利坚合众国总统的妻子。 Rob(罗伯)That is correct. She’s just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life. Before we find out more, here is this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, Any ideas Dan?这是正确的。她刚刚出版了自己的自传，并一直在英国谈论她的生活。在我们了解更多信息之前，以下是本周的问题。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪还是，c） 20 世纪，有什么想法吗？ Dan (担 )th This could be a trick question. The first US presidents were in the 18 Century, and they had wives, but I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later – so I’m th going to take a wild guess and say the 20 Century.th 这可能是一个棘手的问题。第一任美国总统是在 18 世纪，他们有妻子，但我认为实际的术语可能只是在很久以后才引入的 —— 所以我要大胆猜测一下，说 20 世纪。 Rob(罗伯)OK. Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Michelle Obama’s visit to the UK was covered on BBC News. According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?还行。好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 对英国的访问进行了 BBC 新闻报道。根据这份报告，她去过哪里，而她以前去过哪里？ BBC News Report(BBC新闻报道)The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues and one of her main messages was about empowerment. Earlier in the day Mrs Obama revisited a school in north London, a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education during her time as the First Lady.这位前第一夫人公开谈论了许多问题，她的主要信息之一是关于赋权。当天早些时候，奥巴马夫人再次访问了伦敦北部的一所学校，她说，她在担任第一夫人期间第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。 Rob (罗伯 )So, where did she revisit on this trip?那么，她这次旅行重访了哪里呢？ Dan(担)She went to a school in north London. She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education. If you are inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling that you want to do something, you feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular, often because of something someone else has said or achieved.她在伦敦北部的一所学校上学。她说，正是在这所学校，她第一次受到启发，开始专注于教育。如果你受到启发去做某事，你会有一种强烈的感觉，你想做某事，你会有一种强烈的动力去实现某件事，通常是因为别人说过或取得了成就。 Rob(罗伯)The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues. To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject, often a difficult subject, without trying to hide the facts or your feelings. It’s a phrase that is used when people talk about things in their life that they find difficult or embarrassing.该报告还提到，她公开谈论了一些问题。公开谈论某事是指您讨论一个话题，通常是一个困难的话题，而不试图隐藏事实或您的感受。当人们谈论生活中他们觉得困难或尴尬的事情时，会用到这个短语。 Dan(担)One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn’t really belong, that she really have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing and that she didn’t deserve her position.她公开谈论的一件事是她自己觉得自己并不真正属于这里，她真的有技能或才能来做她正在做的事情，她不配得到这个职位。 Rob(罗伯)There is a name for that. It’s called imposter syndrome – that feeling where you think one day everyone will realise that you’re really not very good at what you do.它有一个名字。这被称为冒名顶替者综合症 —— 那种感觉，你认为有一天每个人都会意识到你真的不太擅长你所做的事情。 Dan(担)I get that feeling all the time!我一直都有这种感觉！ Rob(罗伯)I wonder why? Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn’t justified. It’s more a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.我想知道为什么？因为这种冒名顶替者综合症的问题在于它没有道理。这更多的是缺乏自信或社会给我们贴标签的结果。 Dan(担)Well, anyway, back to the report. Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment. That’s giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.好吧，无论如何，回到报告。米歇尔·奥巴马 （Michelle Obama） 也热衷于谈论赋权的话题。这给了人们力量、信心和力量，让他们靠自己实现他们想要的生活。 Rob(罗伯)Let’s hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people based on their class rather than their individual abilities.现在让我们听听米歇尔·奥巴马本人如何谈论我们有时如何根据他们的阶级而不是他们的个人能力来评判他们。 Michelle Obama(米歇尔·奥巴马)That’s often the mistake that we make, we assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right when a lot of times your station in life is limited by the circumstances that you find yourself in.这通常是我们犯的错误，我们假设工人阶级本身并不具有很高的天赋，而很多时候你的生活地位受到你所处环境的限制。 Rob(罗伯)She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life. To assume means ‘to make a judgement which is not based on the facts but on what we think is true’.她在这里说，我们根据人们的社会地位或生活中的地位来假设他们的事情。假设的意思是“做出的判断不是基于事实，而是基于我们认为是真实的”。 Dan(担)She uses the phrase in their own right. When you say that someone is talented in their own right, it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities and not because of any connection with any organisation, individual or class that they happen to be associated with.她自己使用了这个短语。当你说某人本身就有才华时，这意味着他们的才华来自他们自己的技能和能力，而不是因为他们碰巧与之相关的任何组织、个人或阶级有任何联系。 Rob (罗伯 )Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. When did the title ‘First Lady’ first become used for the wife of the US president? Was it in the: a) 18th Century, b) 19th Century or, c) 20th Century, And Dan, you said?在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。“第一夫人”这个头衔是什么时候第一次被用来称呼美国总统的夫人的？是在：a） 18 世纪，b） 19 世纪，还是 c） 20 世纪，还有丹，你说？ Dan(担)I thought it was the 20th Century.我以为是 20 世纪。 Rob(罗伯)Well, you were right.嗯，你是对的。 Dan(担)Yay!耶！ Rob(罗伯)th But let me finish. You were right in that it was later than the 18 Century, which was when th the first US presidents held their positions, but it wasn’t as late as the 20 Century. It was th the second half of the 19 Century when the title First Lady began to be used. Now let’s review today’s vocabulary.但让我说完。你是对的，那时晚于 18 世纪，而 18 世纪是第一任美国总统任职的时候，但还没有到 20 世纪。19 世纪下半叶，第一夫人的头衔开始使用。现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Dan(担)We started with the phrase to talk openly about something. This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject, without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.我们从 to open ly talk about something 这句话开始。这意味着讨论某事，通常是一个困难的话题，而不隐藏您对该主题的感受、情绪或事实。 Rob(罗伯)Then there was the noun empowerment. This is the process of giving people the feeling that they are in control of their lives, making people more confident in their rights and abilities.然后是名词 empowerment。这是给人一种他们掌控自己生活的感觉的过程，使人们对自己的权利和能力更有信心。 Dan (担 )The verb inspire was next. If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something, something difficult or creative. If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.接下来是动词 inspire。如果你激励人们，你就会给他们一种感觉，他们想做一些事情，并且可以做一些困难的事情或有创意的事情。如果你自己也有这种感觉，你就会受到启发。 Rob(罗伯)Next there was the verb to assume something. To assume means ‘to make a judgement about someone or something not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true’.接下来是动词 to assume something。To assume 的意思是“不是根据证据，而是根据你认为或相信是真实的事物来判断某人或某事”。 Dan(担)The next phrase was in their own right.

This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob. NeilAnd I’m Neil. RobToday we’re talking about buttons. NeilYes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen. RobThings like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil? Neil Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one. RobWell, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons? Professor Steven ConnorWe do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something. Rob OK. What does he say about children and buttons? NeilThat they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach. RobYes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us. NeilBut many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient. RobProfessor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion? Professor Steven ConnorYou know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes. RobSo then, why can’t we resist buttons? NeilBecause as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures. RobThe use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it? NeilNo, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them. RobAnd one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again. Professor Steven ConnorYou know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes. Rob Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said? NeilI didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia. RobThat it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary. NeilWe’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen. RobButtons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t. Neil And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily. RobProfessor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands. NeilThe professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe. RobAnd finally we had grooming. NeilThis is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other. RobWell the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com. Bye for now. Neil Bye! Can I just press that button? RobOh go on then, if you like! 【中英文双语脚本】Rob(罗伯)Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I’m Rob.你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil.我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)Today we’re talking about buttons.今天我们讨论的是按钮。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, buttons. Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them but the word is also used for things that we push to make things happen.是的，按钮。纽扣是我们衣服上用来固定它们的东西，但这个词也用于我们推动以使事情发生的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster, kettle. We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it. Not everyone likes buttons though, particularly the ones we have on our clothes. It’s a recognised phobia. What is this fear called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, Any ideas Neil?比如你的床头闹钟、收音机、烤面包机、水壶。我们每周都会不假思索地按下数百个按钮。不过，并不是每个人都喜欢纽扣，尤其是我们衣服上的纽扣。这是一种公认的恐惧症。这种恐惧叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，有什么想法吗，尼尔？ Neil (尼尔 )Er – I think I’ve got a fear of pronouncing these words! No idea what the answer is, I think buttonophobia is much too obvious – so it’s one of the others – or is it? It’s a hard one.呃 – 我想我害怕发音这些词！不知道答案是什么，我认为纽扣恐惧症太明显了 —— 所以它是其他问题之一 —— 或者是吗？这是一个艰难的问题。 Rob(罗伯)Well, I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Thinking Allowed is a BBC Radio 4 programme which covers a range of interesting topics. Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons and how important they are to everyday life. Steven Connor, Professor of English at the University of Cambridge, was on the programme and he talked about the appeal of buttons. What does say about children and buttons?好吧，我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。Thinking Allowed 是 BBC Radio 4 的一档节目，涵盖了一系列有趣的话题。最近，他们讨论了纽扣以及它们对日常生活的重要性。剑桥大学英语教授 Steven Connor 参加了该节目，他谈到了纽扣的吸引力。关于子项和按钮，怎么说？ Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)We do love buttons and I think the pleasure and the temptation of buttons… this temptation and everyone feels it, which is why buttons have to be very convenient. On the other hand they have to be kept away from children, so they’ve got to be put high up on the wall, and buttons that really matter have to be made quite hard to push – like put behind glass or something.我们确实喜欢纽扣，我认为纽扣的乐趣和诱惑……这种诱惑，每个人都能感受到，这就是为什么按钮必须非常方便。另一方面，它们必须远离儿童，所以它们必须放在墙上的高处，真正重要的按钮必须非常难以按下 —— 比如放在玻璃后面或其他东西。 Rob (罗伯 )OK. What does he say about children and buttons?还行。他对孩子和纽扣有什么看法？ Neil(尼尔)That they have to be kept away from them! As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child. I would press any that I saw, so important ones did have to be out of my reach.他们必须远离他们！正如我之前所说，我小时候就喜欢按下按钮。我会按我看到的任何东西，所以重要的肯定是我够不着的。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, he said buttons are a temptation. A temptation is something that makes you want to do something and it’s often used when it’s something you shouldn’t really do. So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous or serious consequences, like a fire alarm, need to be protected, maybe behind glass, so temptation doesn’t get the better of us.是的，他说纽扣是一种诱惑。诱惑是让你想做某事的东西，它经常被用来做你真的不应该做的事情。因此，导致潜在危险或严重后果的按钮（如火灾警报器）需要受到保护，也许是在玻璃后面，这样诱惑就不会战胜我们。 Neil(尼尔)But many buttons have a useful, practical purpose in everyday life, like calling a lift - so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty. The adjective for this is convenient. These everyday buttons have to be convenient.但是许多按钮在日常生活中都有有用的实用用途，例如呼叫电梯 - 因此这些按钮必须易于使用且没有困难。这个形容词很方便。这些日常按钮必须方便。 Rob(罗伯)Professor Connor goes on to say a bit more about why buttons are so appealing. What’s his opinion?Connor 教授继续详细介绍了纽扣为何如此吸引人。他怎么看？ Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。 Rob(罗伯)So then, why can’t we resist buttons?那么，为什么我们不能抗拒纽扣呢？ Neil(尼尔)Because as humans we have a fidgeting instinct. We can’t stay still for very long, we need to move around a lot because we are very digital creatures.因为作为人类，我们有一种坐立不安的本能。我们不能长时间静止不动，我们需要经常四处走动，因为我们是非常数字化的生物。 Rob(罗伯)The use of digital though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?不过，数字的使用与现代在线技术无关，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)No, a digit is a finger or toe. So we are digital creatures – we have fingers and we like to use them.不，手指是手指或脚趾。所以我们是数字生物 – 我们有手指，我们喜欢使用它们。 Rob(罗伯)And one thing other digital creatures do, creatures like apes, is grooming. That is they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes. They look through the hair for insects and bugs and pull them out and eat them. But we can also use the word grooming for humans, someone who is well-groomed for example is neat and tidy, clean and well presented. Here’s Professor Connor again.其他数字生物（如猿类）所做的一件事是梳理毛发。也就是说，他们用手清洁其他猿类的体毛。他们通过毛发寻找昆虫和虫子，然后把它们拉出来吃掉。但我们也可以用 grooming 这个词来形容人类，例如，一个整洁、干净、得体的人。又是康纳教授。 Professor Steven Connor(StevenConnor教授)You know what I think? I think it’s down to the fidgeting instinct of very digital or manual creatures. I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them, we want to make them slightly better… I guess it’s the grooming instinct in apes.你知道我在想什么吗？我认为这要归功于非常数字化或手动生物的坐立不安的本能。我认为我们想摆弄事物并调整它们，我们想让它们稍微好一点……我猜这是猿类的梳理本能。 Rob (罗伯 )Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. Some people have a fear of buttons, it’s a recognised phobia, but what’s it called? Is it A: buttonophobia, B: koumpounophobia, or, C: coulrophobia, And Neil, you said?在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。有些人害怕纽扣，这是一种公认的恐惧症，但它叫什么？是 A：按钮恐惧症，B：koumpounophobia，还是 C：coulrophobia，还有 Neil，你说的？ Neil(尼尔)I didn’t, but I don’t think it can be ‘buttonophobia’, that’d be too easy. And I think coulrophobia is a fear of clowns, so I’m going for the other one - koumpounophobia.我没有，但我不认为这可能是 “纽扣恐惧症”，那太容易了。我认为 coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧，所以我选择了另一个 - koumpounophobia。 Rob(罗伯)That it right. Buttonophobia is a made up word, and as you said, coulrophobia is a fear of clowns. Right, now let’s review today’s vocabulary.没错。Buttonophobia 是一个虚构的词，正如你所说，coulrophobia 是对小丑的恐惧。好，现在让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Neil(尼尔)We’ve been talking about buttons. These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes, or the things that we push to make something happen.我们一直在谈论按钮。这些可以是我们用来固定衣服的小圆件，也可以是我们推动某事发生的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Buttons can be a temptation. We see one, we want to push it. So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something we know we shouldn’t.按钮可能是一种诱惑。我们看到一个，我们想推动它。所以诱惑是让我们想要做一些我们知道不应该做的事情。 Neil (尼尔 )And then we had the adjective convenient. Something that is convenient is easy to use without difficulty. For example the buttons to call a lift are at a very convenient height, they can be reached easily.然后我们有了形容词 方便。方便的东西很容易使用。例如，呼叫电梯的按钮位于非常方便的高度，可以很容易地触及。 Rob(罗伯)Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct. As humans we love to fidget, we like to keep moving around, we can’t stay still for very long and we love to do stuff with our hands.康纳教授接着谈到了我们坐立不安的本能。作为人类，我们喜欢坐立不安，我们喜欢四处走动，我们不能长时间保持静止，我们喜欢用手做事。 Neil(尼尔)The professor talked about us being digital creatures, which means creatures with fingers – a digit is another word for a finger or toe.教授谈到我们是数字生物，这意味着有手指的生物 —— 数字是手指或脚趾的另一种说法。 Rob(罗伯)And finally we had grooming.最后我们进行了梳理。 Neil(尼尔)This is the habit of making ourselves look nice by cleaning, washing and doing our hair. It’s something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.这是通过清洁、洗头和做头发来让自己看起来漂亮的习惯。这是一些动物（例如猿类）为彼此做的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Well the button here in the studio is flashing, which tells me it’s time to wrap up for today. Do join us next time and if you can’t wait, you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube our App and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com.

This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilWhat do you remember of your teenage years? RobOh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil? NeilWell, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly. RobSo whose fault is it? NeilOur brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob? Rob Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess. NeilI’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out? Professor Sarah-Jayne BlakemoreThe first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false. Neil So when did the research into the teenage brain come out? RobSurprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published. NeilAnd she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she? RobNo, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years. NeilWhat I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop. RobYes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true. NeilSo our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time? Professor Sarah-Jayne BlakemoreThe prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet. NeilSo the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob? RobA cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence. NeilSo this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework! RobHa, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”. NeilYes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said? RobI guessed c) 1950s NeilThe answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary. RobAdolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period. NeilSo an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence. Rob Exactly. NeilPapers is the word for published scientific research. RobDogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged. NeilThe prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks. RobAnd cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions. NeilWell my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish. RobWell, your skills are working well Neil. We may be going now but you don’t need to – you can listen or watch us again and find lots more learning English materials on our social media platforms. You can also visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com. NeilSee you soon, goodbye. Rob Bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。这里是六分钟英语，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)What do you remember of your teenage years?你还记得你的青少年时代吗？ Rob(罗伯)Oh, I was a nightmare. I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late, never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?哦，我简直是一场噩梦。我对父母很粗鲁，总是在外面呆到很晚，从不做作业，和错误的人一起出去玩，做了很多错误的决定。你呢，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Well, much the same really. People always say that about teenagers, don’t they? That they go through a period where they are out of control and behave badly. But apparently, it’s not their fault. At least not directly.嗯，真的差不多。人们总是这样说青少年，不是吗？他们经历了一段失控和行为不端的时期。但显然，这不是他们的错。至少不是直接的。 Rob(罗伯)So whose fault is it?那么是谁的错呢？ Neil(尼尔)Our brains’, apparently. Teenagers’ brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour, which could mean that you can’t blame them for acting the way they do. Before we find out more, let’s have our question. There have always been teenagers, but when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Any ideas, Rob?显然是我们的大脑。青少年的大脑仍在控制行为的区域发育，这可能意味着你不能责怪他们的行为方式。在我们了解更多信息之前，让我们先提出我们的问题。一直都有青少年，但“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的呢？是： a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 有什么想法吗，罗伯？ Rob (罗伯 )Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll, so that would have made it the 1950s. That’s my guess.嗯，我认为它大约出现在摇滚乐时代，所以那应该是 1950 年代。这是我的猜测。 Neil(尼尔)I’ll have the answer later in the programme. Sarah-Jayne Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain, particularly the teenage brain. Recently she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme, The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?我将在稍后的节目中提供答案。来自伦敦大学学院的 Sarah-Jayne Blakemore 专门研究大脑的运作，尤其是青少年的大脑。最近，她是 BBC 广播节目 The Life Scientific 的嘉宾。她解释说，关于大脑在青少年时期仍在发育的理解是相当新的。她说第一项研究是什么时候出来的？ Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)The first study showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and significant development throughout adolescence and into the twenties; the first papers were published in the late 90s. Before that, and for example when I was at university, the dogma in the text books was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing much changes after mid-childhood. That dogma is completely false.第一项研究表明，人脑在整个青春期和 20 多岁都经历了这种非常实质性和显着的发展；第一批论文发表于 90 年代后期。在此之前，例如当我上大学时，教科书中的教条是，绝大多数大脑发育发生在生命的最初几年，童年中期之后就没有什么太大的变化了。这个教条是完全错误的。 Neil (尼尔 )So when did the research into the teenage brain come out?那么，对青少年大脑的研究是什么时候出来的呢？ Rob(罗伯)Surprisingly, it wasn’t until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which are published.令人惊讶的是，直到 1990 年代后期才出现。就在这时，她说关于这个主题的第一批论文发表了。在这种情况下，论文是指已发表的科学研究成果。 Neil(尼尔)And she didn’t actually talk about teenagers, did she?她实际上并没有谈论青少年，对吧？ Rob(罗伯)No, that’s right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence, is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult and it more or less is the same as the teenage years.不，没错。她谈到了青春期。这个名词，青春期，是一个人从儿童发展成成人的时期，它或多或少与青少年时期相同。 Neil(尼尔)What I found interesting was that before the 1990s people believed something different about the way our brains develop.我发现有趣的是，在 1990 年代之前，人们认为我们的大脑发育方式有所不同。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, Professor Blakemore said that the dogma had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence. Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.是的，布莱克莫尔教授说，当时的教条是，我们的大脑大多在儿童早期就已经完全发育，早在青春期之前。教条是一个词，用于描述人们被期望接受为真理的强烈信念。 Neil(尼尔)So our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought. What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here is Professor Blakemore again. What excuse can she give for teenagers who don’t get their homework done in time?因此，我们的大脑发育仍然比最初认为的要晚得多。这告诉我们关于青少年行为的什么信息？特别令人感兴趣的是大脑的一个重要部分，称为前额叶皮层。布莱克莫尔教授又来了。她能给那些没有按时完成作业的青少年找什么借口呢？ Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore(Sarah-JayneBlakemore教授)The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain right at the front, just behind the forehead and it’s involved in a whole range of very high-level cognitive tasks such as decision making and planning - we know that this region is undergoing very very large amounts of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homework, it might be too much given that we know that the region of the brain that critically involved in planning is not developed yet.前额叶皮层是大脑中位于前额正后方的部分，它参与了一系列非常高级的认知任务，例如决策和规划 —— 我们知道这个区域在青少年时期正在经历非常非常大量的发育。因此，就我们对青少年的期望而言，例如，计划他们的家庭作业，考虑到我们知道大脑中关键参与计划的区域还没有发育，这可能太高了。 Neil(尼尔)So the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?所以前额叶皮层在认知任务中很重要。那些是什么，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions and planning. It doesn’t happen automatically, you have to think about it. So in the adolescent years this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the noun we had earlier adolescence.认知任务是需要有意识地思考和处理的任务，例如做出决策和规划。它不会自动发生，您必须考虑它。所以在青少年时期，大脑的这一部分还没有完全发育。请注意我们早期青春期的名词的形容词形式。 Neil(尼尔)So this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework!所以这给了你不做功课的好借口！ Rob(罗伯)Ha, ha, I wish I’d known that. I used to say that I’d left my homework on the bus or that the dog had eaten it. Now I could say, “Sorry sir, my brain isn’t developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework”.哈，哈，我真希望我早就知道了。我曾经说我把作业忘在了公共汽车上，或者狗吃了它。现在我可以说，’对不起，先生，我的大脑还不够发达，无法完成计划家庭作业的认知任务’。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, I’m sure that would work! Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week’s question. I asked when was the word ‘teenager’ first used to refer to the 13 – 19 age group? Was it: a) the 1920s b) the 1930s c) the 1950s Rob, you said?是的，我确定那会奏效！在我们结束之前，是时候获得本周问题的答案了。我问“青少年”这个词是什么时候第一次用来指代 13 至 19 岁年龄段的人？你说是：a） 1920 年代 b） 1930 年代 c） 1950 年代 罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)I guessed c) 1950s我猜 c） 1950 年代 Neil(尼尔)The answer is actually b) the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that. Now a quick review of today’s vocabulary.答案实际上是 b） 1930 年代。如果你知道这一点，那就太好了。现在快速回顾一下今天的词汇。 Rob(罗伯)Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from child to adult and the adjective is adolescent – this same word is also the noun for someone who is in that teenage period.青春期是从儿童到成人变化时期的名词，形容词是青少年 —— 同一个词也是处于那个青少年时期的人的名词。 Neil(尼尔)So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behaviour in his or her adolescence.因此，青少年可能要对他或她的青春期行为负责。 Rob (罗伯 )Exactly.完全。 Neil(尼尔)Papers is the word for published scientific research.Papers 是已发表的科学研究的词。 Rob(罗伯)Dogma is strongly held beliefs that are not challenged.教条是坚定不移的信念，不受挑战。 Neil(尼尔)The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which deals with cognitive tasks.前额叶皮层是大脑中处理认知任务的重要组成部分。 Rob(罗伯)And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and consideration, such as planning and making decisions.认知任务是需要积极思考和考虑的心理过程，例如计划和做出决定。 Neil(尼尔)Well my decision making skills tell me that it’s time to finish.好吧，我的决策能力告诉我，是时候完成了。 Rob(罗伯)Well, your skills are working well Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilWe’re going to be looking at a letter from the English alphabet. It’s a letter which has a particular meaning when used at the end of a piece of informal writing such as letters, emails, texts and messages. RobI’m very EXcited. NeilHa ha, very good, very good Rob! RobMy EXpectations are really high. NeilYep, that’s another good one. RobIs it an EXtraordinary letter? NeilOK, thank you Rob, that’s enough of your jokes. I’m getting EXasperated! Oh, now you’ve got me at it! Well, no prizes for guessing what letter we’re focussing on today? Rob Why? NeilNo, it’s not Y. Rob No, no. I didn’t mean the letter ‘y’, I meant the word ‘why’, as in - why are there no prizes? NeilBecause of all the not so subtle clues you’ve been giving. The letter is X. RobYes. Exactly. NeilAlright, I think we get the idea! Before we go much further, let’s have a question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? Any ideas Rob? Rob An excellent question but quite obscure, I’m going to say b) Hindi. NeilWell, I’ll have the answer later on. Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean? RobWell, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing. NeilWhere does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from? Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans… Presenter:That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there. Presenter:It has, clunk. Neil What do we learn about the origins of the X for kisses? RobWell, it’s been used since at least 1763 and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks. NeilAnd why did this come to mean a kiss? RobWell, Dr Wright suggests it’s because of the original pronunciation - &#x2F;ks&#x2F;. NeilAnd at the point the presenter made the connection, didn’t he? RobYes, he did. And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped. NeilAnd this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk. RobAlthough, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example. NeilLet’s listen to that exchange again. Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763. The very first one we know of had seven Xs. I have to say I haven’t gone to seven ever. We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans… Presenter:That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it? Yes it is, isn’t it? I think a penny’s just dropped there. Presenter:It has, clunk. NeilOne thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something you do for everyone. It’s usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life. Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his who wasn’t too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake? Professor Nils Langer, University of BristolA colleague of mine from Bristol, who when she came over from Germany thought that X was just the normal way of closing a letter in England and so she would finish any letter with Xs, even a letter to the Inland Revenue. We never really heard how the Inland Revenue responded to these letters with these Xs. Presenter:They docked her another 20 quid, I think! NeilWhat was her mistake, Rob? RobShe didn’t realise that you don’t put an X on every communication. So she even put it on business letter including one to the Inland Revenue, which is the government department in the UK that deals with tax. NeilWe don’t know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses. But the presenter joked about what their response would have been. RobYes, he joked that they probably docked her another 20 quid. To dock money is to cut the amount of money you are expecting to receive and a quid is a slang word for a British pound. Neil Time now for the answer to our question. English has 26 letters. Which language has 74 letters? Is it… a) Khmer (Cambodian) b) Hindi or c) Armenian? RobI guessed b) Hindi. NeilWell, I suppose it was a one in three chance, but not correct this time. The answer is a) Khmer. Very well done if you knew that. Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme. RobWe started with penny. A penny is an English coin. A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling. NeilThe phrase, the penny has dropped, means that someone has suddenly understood something Rob A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other. NeilThe Inland Revenue is the UK’s tax authority. RobIf you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them. For example, as an employee in the UK your tax is automatically docked from your salary. NeilAnd finally, a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling.

Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself at the end of a message mean?好吧，我稍后会给出答案。现在，罗伯，消息末尾的字母 X 本身是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Well, it means a kiss. The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.嗯，意思是一个吻。亲吻越多，你表现出的爱意就越多。 Neil(尼尔)Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from? Dr Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. When does she say this practice started and where does it come from?用 X 表示亲吻的概念从何而来？Laura Wright 博士来自剑桥大学英语学院，她出现在 BBC Radio 4 节目 Word of Mouth 中。她说这种做法是什么时候开始的，它来自哪里？ Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge (LauraWright博士，剑桥大学英语学院 )Well, we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763.

We get X from the Roman alphabet which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced &#x2F;ks&#x2F; and the Romans…嗯，至少从 1763 年开始，我们就一直在字母底部添加 X 来表示亲吻。我们所知道的第一个有 7 个 X。我不得不说我从来没有去过 7 岁。我们从罗马字母表中得到 X，而罗马字母表又从希腊字母表中得到 X，发音为 &#x2F;ks&#x2F; 和罗马字母…… Presenter:(主持人：)That’s nearly a kiss, isn’t it?

And Dr Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something, particularly something that is obvious to others. She said the penny has just dropped.是的，他做到了。Wright博士用了一个短语来形容某人突然理解了某件事，特别是对其他人来说很明显的事情。她说，一分钱刚刚掉了。 Neil(尼尔)And this has got nothing to do with a penny, which is small coin, actually dropping anywhere. But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling, clunk.这与一分钱无关，一分钱是小硬币，实际上会掉到任何地方。但是主持人用了一个词来开玩笑，我们用它来表示东西掉落的声音，咔嚓咔嚓。 Rob(罗伯)Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk. That’s more like the noise two heavy, metal objects would make - the clunk of a car door, for example.虽然，老实说，一分钱永远不会真正叮当作响。这更像是两个沉重的金属物体发出的噪音 - 例如，车门的叮当声。 Neil(尼尔)Let’s listen to that exchange again.让我们再听一遍那次交流。 Dr Laura Wright, Faculty of English, University of Cambridge (LauraWright博士，剑桥大学英语学院 )Well we’ve been adding Xs for kisses at the bottom of letters since at least 1763.

RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilAnd in this programme we’re discussing food. RobFood glorious food! There’s only one thing better than talking about food and that’s eating it. NeilWell I know you are a bit of a gastronome – someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – but today we’re talking about photographing food, not eating it. RobThat is a shame because I am on a see-food diet – if I see food, I have to eat it. Get it?! NeilYes Rob, very very funny. But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food not eating it is big business as I will explain shortly. But shall we feast on a question first Rob? RobYes, if it tastes good! NeilIt does. So, do you know the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef RobHmm, I’m not a chef expert but I’ll say c) a Sous Chef – it sounds important! NeilWell I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes. RobAnd I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant. NeilWhich isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it! RobYou could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product. NeilMaybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend? Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar ChickIt sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose. NeilRebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words. RobYes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything. NeilAnd that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food. RobYes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant. NeilNow, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens… Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of OxfordWe see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience. NeilRight so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food. RobAnd expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen. NeilRight Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef What did you say, Rob? RobI said c) a Sous chef. Am I right? NeilYou are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen! RobCome on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me! NeilMaybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think. RobWe also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil? NeilAbsolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it? RobVery nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme! NeilWell let’s hope so! RobYes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms. See you soon, bye. NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)And in this programme we’re discussing food.在这个节目中，我们讨论的是食物。 Rob(罗伯)Food glorious food! There’s only one thing better than talking about food and that’s eating it.美食光彩夺目！只有一件事比谈论食物更好，那就是吃它。 Neil(尼尔)Well I know you are a bit of a gastronome – someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – but today we’re talking about photographing food, not eating it.嗯，我知道你有点像个美食家 - 一个喜欢并了解高品质食物的人 - 但今天我们谈论的是拍摄食物，而不是吃它。 Rob(罗伯)That is a shame because I am on a see-food diet – if I see food, I have to eat it. Get it?!这很遗憾，因为我正在吃东西 – 如果我看到食物，我就必须吃它。明白了吗？！ Neil(尼尔)Yes Rob, very very funny. But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food not eating it is big business as I will explain shortly. But shall we feast on a question first Rob?是的，罗伯，非常非常有趣。但是在社交媒体上瘾的世界里，仅仅看到食物不吃它是一件大事，我稍后会解释。但是，我们先吃一个问题好吗，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, if it tastes good!是的，如果味道好的话！ Neil(尼尔)It does. So, do you know the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef确实如此。那么，您知道通常在餐厅厨房中仅次于主厨并承担很多经营责任的人的名字吗？是……a） 糕点师 b） 助理厨师 c） 副厨师长 Rob(罗伯)Hmm, I’m not a chef expert but I’ll say c) a Sous Chef – it sounds important!嗯，我不是厨师专家，但我会说 c） 副厨师长 – 听起来很重要！ Neil(尼尔)Well I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that’s a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes.好吧，我将在节目的后面给出答案。现在让我更多地解释一下食物和照片。如今，一道菜（即准备食用的食物的名词）被拍摄得有多好，比它的实际味道更重要。 Rob(罗伯)And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren’t they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant.我想社交媒体平台是分享美食照片的最佳方式，不是吗？我一直在用智能手机拍下我的食物照片而感到内疚 —— 但仅限于在一家豪华餐厅吃一些美味的食物时。 Neil(尼尔)Which isn’t very often I suppose! But by sharing images across social media, people see them and think the food looks delicious, I must go to that restaurant and eat it!我想这并不常见！但是通过在社交媒体上分享图片，人们看到它们并认为食物看起来很美味，我必须去那家餐厅吃！ Rob(罗伯)You could argue it’s about style over substance, meaning the look of something is better that the content or product.你可以说这是关于风格而不是内容，这意味着某物的外观比内容或产品更好。 Neil(尼尔)Maybe, Rob – although I’m sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks. Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been looking into this. They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here’s one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?也许吧，罗伯 – 尽管我敢肯定有时食物的味道和看起来一样好。无论如何，BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours 一直在调查这个问题。他们与几位有影响力的 Instagram 用户和博主进行了交谈 —— 有影响力意味着有能力让人们改变他们的想法。这是其中之一 – Rebecca Milford，她编辑了一个名为 Bar Chick 的网站。她如何看待这一新趋势？ Rebecca Milford, Editor, Bar Chick(RebeccaMilford，BarChick编辑)It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I’ve got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you’d go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you’re seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose.一张图片胜过千言万语听起来很陈词滥调，但确实如此，我现在有朋友了，而不是像以前那样去餐厅的网站看看他们提供什么，然后你会去他们的 Instagram 帐户查看他们的图片， 然后根据你所看到的从字面上选择你想吃的东西。所以我想它必须像样。 Neil(尼尔)Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there – one that is used so much it has become boring – what we call a cliche. The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words.Rebecca 在那里使用了一句广为人知且使用广为人知的短语 —— 这个短语被使用得如此之多，以至于变得无聊 —— 我们称之为陈词滥调。这句话是一张图片胜过千言万语。 Rob(罗伯)Yes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you’re promoting food, a photo is everything.是的 – 即使这是陈词滥调 – 它确实如此。您在一篇长博客中描述了一顿美妙的饭菜，但您可以从图片中快速看到它的外观，然后在脑海中创造一个关于它的味道的想法。因此，当您推广美食时，照片就是一切。 Neil(尼尔)And that’s why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It’s like a fashion photoshoot for food.这就是为什么一些餐馆向公关公司支付大量资金来拍摄可以在社交媒体上分享的时尚照片。这就像是一次美食的时尚摄影。 Rob(罗伯)Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that’s looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I’ve also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant.是的，Rebecca 说食物必须像样 —— 看起来足够好，让人们看到 —— 因为人们会根据他们看到的东西做出选择。我还听说一些厨师和餐馆老板已经调整了他们的菜单，制作出在智能手机相机上看起来不错的饭菜。顺便说一句，餐馆老板是拥有和管理餐厅的人的名字。 Neil(尼尔)Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens…现在，虽然社交媒体账户（如 Instagram）上的好看食物可能与它的味道不匹配，但有一种理论可能会欺骗你，让你认为它确实很好吃。You and Yours 节目还听取了牛津大学实验心理学家 Charles Spence 教授关于这一切是如何发生的…… Charles Spence, Experimental Psychologist, University of Oxford(CharlesSpence，牛津大学实验心理学家)We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain’s already imagining what it’s going to taste like. And the more beautifully it’s presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience.我们首先看到食物，或者玻璃杯中的饮料，我们的大脑已经在想象它的味道会是什么样子。它呈现得越精美，就越具有艺术性，这设定了更好的期望，它们在某种程度上延续并锚定了品尝体验。 Neil(尼尔)Right so a great photo of food can possibly make us think it tastes better too. We create an idea in our head of how it will taste which influences our expectations when we actually eat the food.是的，一张很棒的食物照片可能会让我们觉得它的味道更好。我们在脑海中创造了一个关于食物味道的想法，这会影响我们实际食用食物时的期望。 Rob(罗伯)And expectation means the feeling that something good is going to happen.而期望意味着感觉好事将要发生。 Neil(尼尔)Right Rob, I’m sure you’re expecting the answer to the question I set you earlier. I asked, if you knew the name for the person who’s usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen after the Head Chef and has lots of responsibility for running it? Is it the… a) Pastry chef b) Commis chef c) Sous chef What did you say, Rob?好的，罗伯，我相信你期待我之前给你的问题的答案。我问道，你是否知道通常在餐厅厨房中仅次于主厨并承担很多经营责任的人的名字？是……a） 糕点师 b） 助理厨师 c） 副厨师长 罗伯，你说什么？ Rob(罗伯)I said c) a Sous chef. Am I right?我说 c） 副厨师长。我说得对吗？ Neil(尼尔)You are Rob! Give that man a job, here maybe in the BBC canteen!你是 罗伯！给那个人一份工作，也许在 BBC 食堂！ Rob(罗伯)Come on Neil, I think I could do better than that! But before I do let’s remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary we’ve discussed today. Starting with gastronome – that’s someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high-quality food – someone like me!来吧，尼尔，我想我可以做得更好！但在我这样做之前，让我们提醒自己我们今天讨论的一些词汇。从 gastronome 开始 - 那是一个喜欢并且对高品质食物非常了解的人 - 像我这样的人！ Neil(尼尔)Maybe, Rob. We also discussed the word influential, meaning having the power to make people change what they think.也许吧，罗伯。我们还讨论了 influential 这个词，意思是有能力让人们改变他们的想法。 Rob(罗伯)We also mentioned cliche – a well-known phrase that is so over-used it has become boring. Like for example ‘a picture speaks a thousand words.’ You never use cliches do you, Neil?我们还提到了陈词滥调 —— 一个众所周知的短语，它被过度使用以至于变得无聊。例如，“一张图片胜过千言万语”。你从来不用陈词滥调，对吧，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Absolutely never. Let’s move on to presentable – that describes something that looks good, is smart and is good enough for people to see. A bit like me in my smart new jumper. Do you like it?绝对不会。让我们继续讨论 Presentable – 它描述了看起来不错、很聪明并且足够让人们看到的东西。有点像我穿着我漂亮的新毛衣。喜欢吗？ Rob(罗伯)Very nice! Well a presenter has to be presentable, Neil! Our next word was expectation, a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen. I have an expectation that people will love this programme!很好！嗯，主持人必须得体，Neil！我们的下一个词是 expectation，这个词描述了好事即将发生的感觉。我期望人们会喜欢这个项目！ Neil(尼尔)Well let’s hope so!好吧，让我们希望如此！ Rob(罗伯)Yes and that brings us to the end of this programme. Don’t forget to check out our social media platforms.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilCatherine, I’m going to start this programme with a quick test, just for you. CatherineOoo, I love tests! NeilComplete this phrase: Wake up and smell the… CatherineCoffee Neil! It’s coffee. I have to say, I love coffee, it’s great. NeilOK, so do you drink much? CatherineWell, just a couple of cups, you know. NeilEvery day? CatherineNo, every hour! I love coffee, don’t you like coffee, Neil? NeilI do but maybe not as much as you! What’s the best thing about it? CatherineIt’s the smell. It’s got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it’s great isn’t it? NeilYes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it? CatherineWell no, not really. It’s always a little disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one. NeilOK, you’ve had quite a lot of coffee today, haven’t you? CatherineJust the usual six cups. NeilWell, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today’s question. The world’s biggest producer of coffee is… CatherineBrazil! Brazil! NeilYes, yes, but that’s not the question. The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia CatherineRight, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right? NeilOK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is? Tim Hayward, Coffee shop ownerIt’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses. NeilSo how important is it? CatherineI’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important. NeilAnd he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away? CatherineWell, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me. NeilCan you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go? CatherineYes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee. NeilDon’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience? CatherineThe effect of the lid? NeilYes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids. Tim HaywardWhat baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird. NeilSo what is he describing there? CatherineI see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience. NeilYes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again. Tim HaywardWhat baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird. NeilThat was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward. Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said? CatherineI said it was a: Colombia. NeilAh, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine. CatherineSo the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential. NeilNext we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee. CatherineSomething that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it. NeilYou might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange. CatherineAnd finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name. NeilWell that is the end of our programe. For more from us, check out Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon, bye. CatherineBye! Fancy a coffee? NeilI think you’ve had too much! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine.我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)Catherine, I’m going to start this programme with a quick test, just for you.Catherine，我将通过一个快速测试来开始这个计划，只为你。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Ooo, I love tests!噢，我喜欢测试！ Neil(尼尔)Complete this phrase: Wake up and smell the…完成这句话：醒来闻到… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Coffee Neil!

It’s got to be the smell. You know, when you open the packet, it’s great isn’t it?是气味。一定是气味。你知道，当你打开数据包时，它很棒，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?是的，但它的味道从来没有像闻起来那么好，不是吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well no, not really. It’s always a little disappointing. I live in hope, another cup, I think it will be better. I might change brands actually and try a different one.嗯，不，不是真的。这总是有点令人失望。我活在希望中，再来一杯，我觉得会更好。我实际上可能会更换品牌并尝试不同的品牌。 Neil(尼尔)OK, you’ve had quite a lot of coffee today, haven’t you?好了，你今天喝了不少咖啡，不是吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Just the usual six cups.只是通常的六杯。 Neil(尼尔)Well, our topic today is the smell of coffee and coffee is also the subject of today’s question. The world’s biggest producer of coffee is…嗯，我们今天的话题是咖啡的味道，咖啡也是今天问题的主题。世界上最大的咖啡生产商是…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Brazil! Brazil!巴西！巴西！ Neil(尼尔)Yes, yes, but that’s not the question. The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer, which is the second largest coffee producing country? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia是的，是的，但这不是问题。问题是，巴西是最大的咖啡生产国，而巴西是第二大咖啡生产国？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Right, so it’s not Brazil but I bet it’s another South American country, so I’m going to go for Columbia. Columbia, is that right?是的，这不是巴西，但我敢打赌这是另一个南美国家，所以我会去哥伦比亚。哥伦比亚，对吗？ Neil(尼尔)OK, we’ll have the answer later in the programme by which time, maybe the caffeine will have left your body Catherine. Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner. He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 programme The Kitchen Cabinet. How important does he say the smell of coffee is?好的，我们将在节目的后面有答案，到那时，也许咖啡因已经离开了你的身体，凯瑟琳。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 是一位咖啡店老板。他出现在 BBC Radio 4 节目 The Kitchen Cabinet 中。他说咖啡的味道有多重要？ Tim Hayward, Coffee shop owner(TimHayward，咖啡店老板)It’s absolutely vital, it’s the key thing. And when you walk in to the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you’re getting physiological responses.这绝对至关重要，这是关键。当你早上走进咖啡店时，那股气味袭来，你就会产生生理反应。 Neil(尼尔)So how important is it?那么它有多重要呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m feeling a bit calmer now. Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital. That means it’s very important, it’s perhaps the most important thing. And he backs this up by saying that it’s the key thing. Something that’s key is something that is essential, it’s really important.我现在感觉平静了一些。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 说，咖啡的气味至关重要。这意味着它非常重要，也许是最重要的事情。他支持这一点，说这是关键。关键是必不可少的东西，它真的很重要。 Neil(尼尔)And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you, you get a physiological response. This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee. Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation. Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?他说，当你体验到这种气味时，当气味袭来时，你会得到一种生理反应。这句话的意思是你的身体对咖啡的气味有反应。也许你的嘴巴开始在期待中流口水。Catherine，当你喝咖啡时，你通常会把它放在那儿还是带走？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I usually take it away, although if I’m feeling really in need of a coffee hit, I might have one there and then get another one and take with me.嗯，我通常会把它带走，但如果我真的觉得需要一杯咖啡，我可能会在那里喝一杯，然后再买一杯带走。 Neil(尼尔)Can you describe the container you are given when you have a coffee to go?您能描述一下当您喝咖啡外带时给您的容器吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, it’s in a tall paper cup with a lid. And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.是的，它装在一个带盖的高纸杯里。盖子上有一个洞，这样我就可以喝那杯可爱的咖啡了。 Neil(尼尔)Don’t you think that’s a problem? I mean, we know how important the smell is, so what is the effect of the lid on that experience?你不觉得这是个问题吗？我的意思是，我们知道气味有多重要，那么盖子对这种体验有什么影响呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)The effect of the lid?盖子的效果？ Neil(尼尔)Yes. Well here’s Tim Hayward again talking about coffee being served with lids.是的。好吧，这是 Tim Hayward 再次谈论带盖咖啡。 Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.让我感到困惑的是，有多少大型咖啡连锁店实际上销售的是带有去除气味的杯子产品。所以你走进咖啡店，你会闻到气味，但当你真正把饮料拿出来时，你是在用一种旨在将热液体直接通过你的舌头，但阻止任何气味进入你的鼻子的东西喝它。这太奇怪了。 Neil(尼尔)So what is he describing there?那么他在那里描述了什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I see now, yes, He’s talking about the big coffee chains. A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities sometimes around the world. I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains. He says that by putting a lid on take away cups, you’re actually blocking the smell - that smell that is really important to the coffee experience.我现在明白了，是的，他说的是大型咖啡连锁店。连锁店是一家在城镇和城市拥有大量门店的公司，有时遍布世界各地。我想我们都能想到几家知名的咖啡连锁店。他说，通过在外卖杯上盖上盖子，你实际上是在阻挡气味 —— 这种气味对咖啡体验非常重要。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, and he says that he finds that weird, which is a way of saying he finds it unusual, thinks it’s strange, odd. So much so that he says it baffles him. If you are baffled by something, you find it confusing, you can’t really understand it. Here’s Tim Hayward again.是的，他说他觉得这很奇怪，这是他觉得不寻常的一种方式，认为这很奇怪，很奇怪。以至于他说这让他感到困惑。如果你对某件事感到困惑，你会觉得它很困惑，你无法真正理解它。蒂姆·海沃德 （Tim Hayward） 又来了。 Tim Hayward(蒂姆·海沃德)What baffles me is that how many of the large coffee chains actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell. So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out you are drinking it from something that is designed to deliver the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stop any smell coming up to your nose. That’s just weird.让我感到困惑的是，有多少大型咖啡连锁店实际上销售的是带有去除气味的杯子产品。所以你走进咖啡店，你会闻到气味，但当你真正把饮料拿出来时，你是在用一种旨在将热液体直接通过你的舌头，但阻止任何气味进入你的鼻子的东西喝它。这太奇怪了。 Neil(尼尔)That was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward. Right before we have another cup of this week’s vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. After Brazil, which country produces most coffee? Is it: a: Colombia b: Vietnam c: Ethiopia Catherine, you said?那是咖啡店老板蒂姆·海沃德（Tim Hayward）。在我们又来了解本周的词汇之前，让我们来了解一下这个问题的答案。在巴西之后，哪个国家的咖啡产量最多？是： a： 哥伦比亚 b： 越南 c： 埃塞俄比亚 凯瑟琳，你说的？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I said it was a: Colombia.我说是：哥伦比亚。 Neil(尼尔)Ah, sorry, no extra coffee for you today! The answer is Vietnam. And now on to the vocabulary we looked at. Take it away Catherine.啊，对不起，今天没有额外的咖啡给你！答案是越南。现在我们来看一下词汇。把它带走凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important. And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential.所以第一个词是 vital，这是一个形容词，意思是非常重要。另一个含义非常相似的词是 key，意思是必不可少的。 Neil(尼尔)Next we had the phrase physiological responses. Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction. So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something, like the smell of coffee.接下来，我们有 physiological responses 这个短语。生理是指我们的身体所做的事情，而反应是一种反应。因此，生理反应是您的身体对某物的反应，例如咖啡的气味。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Something that baffles you, confuses you, you don’t understand it.让你困惑、困惑、你不理解的东西。 Neil(尼尔)You might find something that baffles you to be weird. This adjective means unusual or strange.你可能会发现一些让你感到困惑的事情很奇怪。这个形容词的意思是不寻常或奇怪。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name.最后，连锁店是来自同一家公司、同名的一组商店。 Neil(尼尔)Well that is the end of our programe.

CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilCatherine, what’s the connection between hierarchies, managers and chickens? CatherineWell, I don’t know Neil, but I’m, sure you’re going to tell me. NeilFirst of all, could you explain for our listeners what a hierarchy is? CatherineOf course! A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work! NeilBut where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine? CatherineWell, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371. NeilWell, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock. Margaret HeffernanHe compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work. NeilWhich flock was most successful? CatherineWell, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful. NeilYes, but why was that? CatherineWell, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them. NeilSo, what do we learn from this experiment? CatherineWell, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers. NeilBut there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again. Margaret HeffernanSo chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them. NeilSo, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens? CatherineWell, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves. NeilPecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate? CatherineWell, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens. NeilRight, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine? CatherineI said 371. NeilWell, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right! CatherineThat’s a lot of eggs! NeilIndeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance. CatherineAn expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy. NeilA group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens. CatherineAnother of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done. NeilAnd if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be. CatherineAnd finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people. For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel. NeilWell that is the end of the programme.

CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And I’m Catherine.我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)Catherine, what’s the connection between hierarchies, managers and chickens?Catherine，等级制度、管理者和鸡之间有什么联系？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I don’t know Neil, but I’m, sure you’re going to tell me.嗯，我不认识 Neil，但我确信你会告诉我的。 Neil(尼尔)First of all, could you explain for our listeners what a hierarchy is?首先，您能为我们的听众解释一下什么是层次结构吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Of course! A hierarchy is a way of organising people. For example, in a company, where there are people working at different levels. You’ve got bosses, managers and workers. The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work!答案是肯定的！等级制度是一种组织人员的方式。例如，在一家公司中，有不同级别的人。你有老板、经理和工人。工人做工作，经理开会阻止工人做工作！ Neil(尼尔)But where do the chickens come in? We’ll find out shortly, but first here is today’s question and it is – surprise, surprise – about chickens. What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year? Is it: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What do you think Catherine?但是鸡从哪里来呢？我们很快就会知道，但首先是今天的问题，它是 —— 惊喜，惊喜 —— 关于鸡。一只鸡一年产下的创纪录的鸡蛋数量是多少？是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你怎么看 凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it’s 371.嗯，我认为大多数鸡每天下一次蛋，所以我认为是 371。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we will have an answer later in the programme. Now, for hierarchies and chickens. In the radio programme The Joy of 9 to 5, produced by Somethin’ Else for the BBC, entrepreneur Margaret Heffernan described an experiment. In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens to a group of super-chickens. That’s chickens with an above average egg production. Which was the most successful? Here’s Margaret Heffernan, and by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock.好吧，我们将在节目的后面给出答案。现在，对于层次结构和鸡。在 Somethin’ Else 为 BBC 制作的广播节目 The Joy of 9 to 5 中，企业家 Margaret Heffernan 描述了一项实验。在这个实验中，研究人员比较了一组普通鸡和一组超级鸡的产蛋量。那是产蛋量高于平均水平的鸡。哪个最成功？这是 Margaret Heffernan，顺便说一句，一群鸡的名词是一群鸡。 Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)He compares the two flocks over six generations. The average flock just gets better and better and better. Egg production increases dramatically. The super-flock of super-chickens, at the end of six generations, all but three are dead, because the other three have killed the rest. They’ve achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest. And that’s what we do at work.他将这两个羊群进行了六代的比较。普通的羊群变得越来越好。产蛋量急剧增加。超级鸡的超级群，在六代结束时，除了三个之外，其他都死了，因为其他三个已经杀死了其余的。他们通过压制其他人的生产力来实现自己的个人生产力。这就是我们在工作中所做的。 Neil(尼尔)Which flock was most successful?哪个鸡群最成功？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the super-flock actually killed each other, so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful.嗯，超级鸡群实际上是互相残杀的，所以事实证明，普通鸡群总共产下更多的蛋，而且更成功。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, but why was that?是的，但为什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the super-chickens must have seen their other flock members not as colleagues, but as competitors. Now to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity. This noun refers to the amount of work that’s done. So, on an individual level, the super- chickens achieved productivity because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members. Suppressed here means they ‘stopped the other chickens from being productive’ by killing them.好吧，超级鸡一定把他们的其他鸡群成员看作不是同事，而是竞争对手。现在要理解这一点，我们必须从生产力这个词开始。这个名词指的是完成的工作量。因此，在个体层面上，超级鸡之所以能提高生产力，是因为它们抑制了鸡群成员的生产力。这里的 suppressed 意味着他们通过杀死其他鸡来“阻止其他鸡生产”。 Neil(尼尔)So, what do we learn from this experiment?那么，我们从这个实验中学到了什么呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, Margaret Heffernan suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace. When everyone is equal, productivity is high, but as soon as there’s a hierarchy - as soon as there are managers - things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers. They demonstrate their productivity as managers, by interfering with the productivity of the workers.Margaret Heffernan 认为，我们在人类工作场所看到了这种行为。当每个人都平等时，生产力会很高，但是一旦有等级制度 —— 只要有经理 —— 事情就会出错，因为并非所有经理都认为他们的角色是让员工的生活更轻松。他们通过干扰工人的生产力来展示他们作为管理者的生产力。 Neil(尼尔)But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy. How are those hierarchies different though? Here’s Margaret Heffernan again.但还有其他实验表明，鸡在等级制度中是有生产力的。不过，这些层次结构有何不同？玛格丽特·赫弗南 又来了。 Margaret Heffernan(玛格丽特·赫弗南)So chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy - that’s where we get the term pecking order from. But it’s one that they create among themselves, rather than one that’s imposed upon them.所以鸡有一个内置的，或者如果你愿意的话，有一个继承的层次结构 - 这就是我们得到术语 啄食顺序 的地方。但这是他们自己创造的，而不是强加给他们的。 Neil(尼尔)So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?那么，至少对鸡来说，哪种层次结构是有效的呢？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn’t imposed. That means a good hierarchy isn’t forced on the chickens. They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally. They work out the pecking order themselves.嗯，最好的等级制度是没有强加的等级制度。这意味着良好的等级制度不会强加给鸡。自然，当他们自己创建层次结构时，他们会做得很好。他们自己制定啄食顺序。 Neil(尼尔)Pecking order is a great phrase. We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation. The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are. Where does this phrase originate?啄食顺序是一个很棒的短语。我们用它来描述组织中的重要性级别。你越重要，你的啄食顺序就越高。这句话从何而来？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks. They hit or bite other chickens with them. And the most important or dominant chickens, peck all the others. The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked and do some pecking themselves, and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens. So, there is a definite pecking order in chickens.嗯，啄是指鸡用喙做什么。他们用它们打或咬其他鸡。而最重要或占主导地位的鸡，啄所有其他鸡。最上面的鸡会啄所有的东西，中等等级的鸡会被啄食并自己做一些啄食，有些鸡只被其他鸡啄食。所以，鸡的啄食顺序是明确的。 Neil(尼尔)Right, time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was. The options were: a: 253 b: 371 c: 426 What did you say, Catherine?好了，是时候复习本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解一下测验的答案。我问一只鸡一年产蛋的记录数量是多少。选项是： a： 253 b： 371 c： 426 你说什么，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I said 371.我说 371。 Neil(尼尔)Well, lucky you! You’re definitely top of the pecking order, aren’t you? Because you are right!好吧，你很幸运！你绝对是排名靠前的，不是吗？因为你是对的！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s a lot of eggs!好多鸡蛋啊！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed. Now, the vocabulary. We are talking about hierarchies - a way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance.事实上。现在，词汇。我们谈论的是等级制度 - 一种组织具有不同重要性的社会或工作场所的方式。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)An expression with a similar meaning is pecking order, which relates to how important someone, or a chicken, is, within a hierarchy.具有相似含义的表达是 peking order，它与某人或一只鸡在层次结构中的重要性有关。 Neil(尼尔)A group of chickens is a flock. It’s also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens.一群鸡是一群鸡。它也是 birds 的通用集体名词，而不仅仅是 chickens。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Another of our words was the noun productivity, which refers to the amount of work that is done.我们的另一个词是名词 productivity，它指的是完成的工作量。 Neil(尼尔)And if you suppress someone’s productivity, you stop them from being as productive as they could be.如果你压制某人的生产力，你就会阻止他们尽可能地提高他们的生产力。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And finally, there was the verb to impose. If you impose something, you force it on people. For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel.最后，还有动词 to impose。如果你强加了什么，你就把它强加给人们。例如，政府对燃料征收新的税。 Neil(尼尔)Well that is the end of the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. SamAnd I’m Sam. NeilAnd we are sitting here in New Broadcasting House, in the middle of London. Would you say, Sam, that this is an isolated place? SamOh no, not at all. Isolated means far away from other places and people. NeilDoes that mean then, do you think, that you can’t be lonely here, with all these people around and all these things to do? SamAh, good question. Can you be lonely in a crowd? Yes, of course, I think you can be because being lonely isn’t about physical isolation. I think you can be lonely anywhere if you feel that you are disconnected from the world around you, if you feel that no one understands you. If you are living happily in isolation in The Scottish Highlands, for example, I’m sure you could feel lonely if you came here to London. NeilWell, loneliness is today’s topic. The BBC has just completed a big survey about it which we will learn more about shortly. But first, of course, a question: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet - by which I mean the place furthest away from anywhere else with the fewest people living there. Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert, or is it c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What do you think, Sam? SamI’ve got absolutely no idea, so this is just a guess - I think it’s the one in Antarctica. I’m going to go with that. NeilWell, we’ll have the answer later on in the programme. Loneliness is seen as a big problem for the mental health of the population, so much so that the British government has a minister for loneliness. But which age group suffers most from loneliness. Here is a BBC report about the research. James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondentThere is a common stereotype that loneliness affects only the old and the isolated. It does, but what this experiment also shows is that loneliness is felt throughout life. People aged between 16 and 24 experience loneliness more often and more intensely than any other age group. NeilSo according to the research, Sam, which section of society is most affected by loneliness? SamThis might be a surprise, but it’s 16 to 24 year olds. NeilI was surprised by that because like many, I would’ve guessed that it was older people. SamThe reporter did say that that was a stereotype. A stereotype is nothing to do with stereo music, but it’s the noun we use to describe a very simple and basic judgement of someone and their character and personality based on their age, nationality, profession and so on. So a stereotype of British people is that we can’t cook, we have bad teeth, we are very reserved and never say what we mean. NeilI don’t know what you mean, my cooking is wonderful, Sam. And the stereotype is that old people get lonely. SamMuch like the stereotypes of British people, this may be true in some cases - I’ve eaten some of your home-cooked meals remember, Neil - but it’s not true for the majority. It is young people who feel lonely more often and more intensely. Intensely here means strongly. The feeling of loneliness is stronger in young people than older people. NeilThe reporter goes on to give some explanation for why young people might be more lonely. James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondentResearchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data, suggested feeling lonely may plague the young because it’s a time of identity change. Figuring out your place in the world and of learning to regulate emotions. NeilHe says that feeling lonely may plague young people, what does he mean there? SamIf you are plagued by something, it means that it troubles you, it bothers you and not just once, it’s something that happens continually or repeatedly. NeilAnd he says this may be because at that age we are still figuring out our place in the world. We are trying to understand the world and what we are supposed to do with our lives. SamHe also suggests that younger people have not yet learned how to regulate their emotions, which is another way of saying to control their emotions. NeilRight. Time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet? Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert or c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What did you say, Sam? SamI said a). Neil Well, I’m afraid to say the answer is actually c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. It has a population of fewer than 300 and it’s only accessible by a 6-day voyage by ship from South Africa. SamSo not a popular place for a weekend break! NeilIndeed not. Now it’s time for a recap of our vocabulary. The first word was isolated which Tristan da Cunha certainly is. It means far away from other place and people. SamThen there was stereotype the noun for a simplistic view of person or group based on their nationality, age, profession and the like. NeilIntensely means strongly. SamBeing plagued by something means it causes you problems and difficulties. NeilIf you are trying to figure something out, you are trying to understand it. SamAnd to regulate something means to control it. NeilWell, sadly, that’s the end of the programme. Hopefully you won’t feel too lonely without us, remember we are always here on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Sam(山姆)And I’m Sam.我是 Sam。 Neil(尼尔)And we are sitting here in New Broadcasting House, in the middle of London. Would you say, Sam, that this is an isolated place?我们现在坐在伦敦市中心的新广播大楼。山姆，你会说这是一个偏僻的地方吗？ Sam(山姆)Oh no, not at all. Isolated means far away from other places and people.哦，不，一点也不。孤立意味着远离其他地方和人。 Neil(尼尔)Does that mean then, do you think, that you can’t be lonely here, with all these people around and all these things to do?那么，你认为这是否意味着，你在这里不会孤独，周围有这么多人，有这么多事情要做？ Sam(山姆)Ah, good question. Can you be lonely in a crowd? Yes, of course, I think you can be because being lonely isn’t about physical isolation. I think you can be lonely anywhere if you feel that you are disconnected from the world around you, if you feel that no one understands you. If you are living happily in isolation in The Scottish Highlands, for example, I’m sure you could feel lonely if you came here to London.啊，好问题。你会在人群中感到孤独吗？是的，当然，我认为你可以，因为孤独不是身体上的孤立。我认为，如果你觉得自己与周围的世界脱节，如果你觉得没有人理解你，那么你在任何地方都会感到孤独。例如，如果你在苏格兰高地快乐地与世隔绝地生活，我相信如果你来到伦敦，你会感到孤独。 Neil(尼尔)Well, loneliness is today’s topic. The BBC has just completed a big survey about it which we will learn more about shortly. But first, of course, a question: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet - by which I mean the place furthest away from anywhere else with the fewest people living there. Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert, or is it c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What do you think, Sam?嗯，孤独是今天的话题。BBC 刚刚完成了一项关于它的大型调查，我们很快就会了解更多信息。但首先，当然，一个问题：地球上最孤立的有人居住的地方在哪里 —— 我指的是离其他任何地方最远、居住在那里的人最少的地方。是：a） 南极洲的麦克默多站；b） 埃及西部沙漠的锡瓦绿洲，还是 c） 南大西洋的特里斯坦达库尼亚岛 山姆，你怎么看？ Sam(山姆)I’ve got absolutely no idea, so this is just a guess - I think it’s the one in Antarctica. I’m going to go with that.我完全不知道，所以这只是一个猜测 - 我认为它是南极洲的那个。我要接受这个。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll have the answer later on in the programme. Loneliness is seen as a big problem for the mental health of the population, so much so that the British government has a minister for loneliness. But which age group suffers most from loneliness. Here is a BBC report about the research.好吧，我们稍后会在节目中给出答案。孤独被视为人们心理健康的一个大问题，以至于英国政府设立了一位孤独大臣。但是哪个年龄段的人最容易受到孤独的影响。这是 BBC 关于这项研究的报道。 James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondent(詹姆斯·加拉格尔，BBC 健康与科学记者)There is a common stereotype that loneliness affects only the old and the isolated. It does, but what this experiment also shows is that loneliness is felt throughout life. People aged between 16 and 24 experience loneliness more often and more intensely than any other age group.有一个普遍的刻板印象，即孤独只影响老年人和孤立的人。确实如此，但这个实验还表明，孤独贯穿一生。16 至 24 岁的人比任何其他年龄段的人都更频繁、更强烈地感到孤独。 Neil(尼尔)So according to the research, Sam, which section of society is most affected by loneliness?那么根据研究，山姆，社会上哪个阶层受孤独的影响最大呢？ Sam(山姆)This might be a surprise, but it’s 16 to 24 year olds.这可能是一个惊喜，但这是 16 到 24 岁的年轻人。 Neil(尼尔)I was surprised by that because like many, I would’ve guessed that it was older people.我对此感到惊讶，因为和许多人一样，我会猜到是老年人。 Sam(山姆)The reporter did say that that was a stereotype. A stereotype is nothing to do with stereo music, but it’s the noun we use to describe a very simple and basic judgement of someone and their character and personality based on their age, nationality, profession and so on. So a stereotype of British people is that we can’t cook, we have bad teeth, we are very reserved and never say what we mean.记者确实说这是一种刻板印象。刻板印象与立体声音乐无关，但它是我们用来描述根据年龄、国籍、职业等对某人及其性格和个性的非常简单和基本的判断的名词。所以对英国人的刻板印象是，我们不会做饭，我们的牙齿不好，我们非常内向，从不说我们的意思。 Neil(尼尔)I don’t know what you mean, my cooking is wonderful, Sam. And the stereotype is that old people get lonely.我不知道你的意思，我的厨艺真棒，山姆。刻板印象是老年人会感到孤独。 Sam(山姆)Much like the stereotypes of British people, this may be true in some cases - I’ve eaten some of your home-cooked meals remember, Neil - but it’s not true for the majority. It is young people who feel lonely more often and more intensely. Intensely here means strongly. The feeling of loneliness is stronger in young people than older people.就像英国人的刻板印象一样，在某些情况下可能是真的 —— 记住，尼尔，我吃过你的一些家常菜 —— 但对大多数人来说并非如此。年轻人感到孤独的频率更高、更强烈。这里的 intensely 意思是强烈。年轻人的孤独感比老年人更强烈。 Neil(尼尔)The reporter goes on to give some explanation for why young people might be more lonely.记者继续解释了为什么年轻人可能更孤独。 James Gallagher, BBC Health and science correspondent(詹姆斯·加拉格尔，BBC 健康与科学记者)Researchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data, suggested feeling lonely may plague the young because it’s a time of identity change. Figuring out your place in the world and of learning to regulate emotions.曼彻斯特大学的研究人员分析了这些数据，他们认为孤独感可能会困扰年轻人，因为这是一个身份改变的时期。弄清楚你在世界上的位置并学习调节情绪。 Neil(尼尔)He says that feeling lonely may plague young people, what does he mean there?他说，孤独感可能会困扰年轻人，他这句话是什么意思？ Sam(山姆)If you are plagued by something, it means that it troubles you, it bothers you and not just once, it’s something that happens continually or repeatedly.如果你被某件事所困扰，这意味着它困扰着你，它困扰着你，而且不仅仅是一次，它是持续或反复发生的事情。 Neil(尼尔)And he says this may be because at that age we are still figuring out our place in the world. We are trying to understand the world and what we are supposed to do with our lives.他说这可能是因为在那个年龄，我们仍在弄清楚自己在世界上的位置。我们试图理解世界以及我们应该如何对待我们的生活。 Sam(山姆)He also suggests that younger people have not yet learned how to regulate their emotions, which is another way of saying to control their emotions.他还建议，年轻人还没有学会如何调节自己的情绪，这是控制自己情绪的另一种说法。 Neil(尼尔)Right. Time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the answer to the quiz. I asked: Where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet? Is it: a) McMurdo Station in Antarctica; b) Siwa Oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert or c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic What did you say, Sam?好的。是时候回顾一下本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解一下测验的答案。我问道：地球上最偏僻的有人居住的地方在哪里？是：a） 南极洲的麦克默多站；b） 埃及西部沙漠的锡瓦绿洲 或 c） 南大西洋的特里斯坦达库尼亚岛 山姆，你说什么？ Sam(山姆)I said a). Neil Well, I’m afraid to say the answer is actually c) the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. It has a population of fewer than 300 and it’s only accessible by a 6-day voyage by ship from South Africa.我说 a）。Neil：嗯，我不敢说答案实际上是 c） 南大西洋的 Tristan da Cunha 岛。它的人口不到 300 人，只能从南非乘船 6 天才能到达。 Sam(山姆)So not a popular place for a weekend break!所以不是周末度假的热门地方！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed not. Now it’s time for a recap of our vocabulary. The first word was isolated which Tristan da Cunha certainly is. It means far away from other place and people.确实不是。现在是时候回顾一下我们的词汇了。第一个词是孤立的，Tristan da Cunha 肯定是。它的意思是远离其他地方和人。 Sam(山姆)Then there was stereotype the noun for a simplistic view of person or group based on their nationality, age, profession and the like.然后是刻板印象，即根据国籍、年龄、职业等对个人或群体的简单化看法。 Neil(尼尔)Intensely means strongly.强烈意味着强烈。 Sam(山姆)Being plagued by something means it causes you problems and difficulties.被某事困扰意味着它会给你带来麻烦和困难。 Neil(尼尔)If you are trying to figure something out, you are trying to understand it.如果你试图弄清楚某件事，你就在试图理解它。 Sam(山姆)And to regulate something means to control it.而 to regulation something 的意思是控制它。 Neil(尼尔)Well, sadly, that’s the end of the programme. Hopefully you won’t feel too lonely without us, remember we are always here on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, our App and of course the website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye.好吧，遗憾的是，该计划到此结束。希望没有我们，您不会感到太孤独，请记住，我们一直在 Instagram、Facebook、Twitter、YouTube、我们的应用节目，当然还有 bbclearningenglish.com 的网站。一会见。再见。 Sam(山姆)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】isolatedfar away from other places and people与世隔绝远离其他地方和人群；偏僻的；孤立的The isolated village was accessible only by boat.与世隔绝的村庄只能乘船到达。 stereotypea simplistic view of person or group based on certain characteristics such as nationality, age, profession刻板印象基于某些特征（如国籍、年龄、职业）对个人或群体的简单化看法He doesn’t fit the stereotype of a successful businessman.他不符合成功商人的刻板印象。 intenselystrongly强烈地强烈地；剧烈地She intensely disliked the idea.她强烈反感这个主意。 to be plagued by somethingto be tormented by something; to have it causing you problems and difficulties受…困扰受…折磨；受…之苦；为…所苦The country is plagued by corruption.该国饱受腐败之苦。 figure something outtry to understand something弄明白试图理解某事I’m trying to figure out what went wrong.我正试图弄明白出了什么问题。 to regulateto control规范；调节控制；调节；管理The government regulates the prices of essential goods.政府对生活必需品的價格進行管制。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["学习笔记"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】爱美是人的天性吗？","path":"/2018/11/01/wechat-2018-11-01/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilHello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. SamAnd I’m Sam. NeilAnd in this programme we’re looking at the word objectification. SamObjectification is when we reduce people to objects. NeilAn example of this is advertising and the media and in particular the way women have been shown. Impossibly attractive and implausibly perfect models in adverts and in movies and on TV you are much more likely to see naked or half-naked women than men. SamObjectification can lead to issues in society such as inequality and discrimination. Objectification of women is a problem but what about the objectification of men? NeilBefore we hear more, it’s time for a question. Today’s question is: on British TV in which decade was a completely naked man first seen? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What do you think Sam? SamI’m going for the 60s. NeilI’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now Sam, do you know the TV programme Love Island? SamYes, it’s a kind of a dating show and all the contestants - men and women - spend a lot of time in their swimming costumes and they’ve all got perfect bodies. NeilYes, that’s right. It’s a programme that seems equally to objectify men and women equally. But is that a bad thing? Dr Peter Lucas is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire. He spoke on this topic on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. What does he suggest might be the advantage of featuring men with ‘perfect’ bodies? Dr Peter LucasIf you look at the impact of TV series like Love Island for instance, the producers of that programme present that as, have described that as being aspirational for their audience. It’s presenting role models, its presenting models that people are supposed to aspire to. Now many women, thinking about the male bodies that are on display there might think well, if it means that more men get off to the gym, look after themselves physically, surely that’s a good thing. NeilSo what might be an advantage of these highly fit athletic bodies on show? SamDr Lucas suggests that seeing those bodies might encourage men to go to the gym and work hard to improve their fitness and health and that could be a good thing. NeilYes, the people in the programme are described as role models. A role model is someone whose behaviour is seen as a good example for others to copy. SamI’m not sure the behaviour of the people in Love Island makes them good role models, but perhaps from the point of view of their physical fitness they give us something to aspire to. If you aspire to something, it’s something you can aim for, something you want to achieve. Dr Lucas also used a related word, aspirational. The TV series Love Island was described as being aspirational. It shows a lifestyle that people would like to have, something they might aim to achieve. NeilBut there are also dangers to encouraging people to get to the gym. Here’s Dr Lucas again. Dr Peter LucasBut also it’s likely to generate higher levels of narcissism, self-consciousness, becoming obsessive about your appearance. It’s not particularly an attractive feature either in men or in women and I suspect that’s impacting on men’s behaviour in a way which is detrimental in the same sort of way that’s been detrimental for women really, for decades. NeilHe talks about behaviour that is detrimental, this means behaviour that has a negative impact. What behaviours does he say are detrimental? SamIf people become obsessed by their appearance it could lead to narcissism. This is a condition where you spend so much time focussing on yourself, your own looks, your own body that you stop caring about anyone else. NeilAnd because it’s very very hard to get that kind of body it can also lead to people being very self-conscious. They might become embarrassed about their bodies and lose confidence in themselves as a result. Right. It’s almost time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have theanswer to the quiz. In what decade was the first naked man seen on British TV? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What did you say, Sam? SamI said c) the 60s. NeilI’m afraid the revolution had come earlier than that. The correct answer is the 1950s. It was a 1957 documentary called Out of Step, part of which was filmed at a nudist colony. Now, time for our vocabulary. SamOur first word was objectification. This is the noun for when we reduce a human being to an object. We don’t think of them as a real person anymore. The verb is to objectify. NeilSomeone whose behaviour is a good example that others want to copy is a role model. SamWhen it comes to presenting 6 Minute English, you are my role model, Neil. NeilYou’re too kind, and I aspire to your level of professionalism, Sam. To aspire to - to aim to be, to hope to achieve. SamThat is related to the next word, aspirational. This adjective is used to describe the desire to improve parts of you life - for example, getting a better job or a better body. Aspirational TV programmes or adverts show lifestyles that people might want to betheirs. NeilOur next word is an adjective for something that is bad for you, something that has a negative effect. The adjective is detrimental. SamWe heard that aspiring to the perfect body can be detrimental because it might lead to narcissism. Narcissism is the term for someone who is so obsessed with their own body and life that they don’t care about anyone else. NeilAchieving that perfect body is incredibly hard and impossible for most real people and not achieving it can make people overly self-conscious - which in this situation means that they can lose confidence in themselves.

NeilBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.大家好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Sam(山姆)And I’m Sam.我是 Sam。 Neil(尼尔)And in this programme we’re looking at the word objectification.在这个节目中，我们关注的是物化这个词。 Sam(山姆)Objectification is when we reduce people to objects.物化是指我们将人简化为对象。 Neil(尼尔)An example of this is advertising and the media and in particular the way women have been shown. Impossibly attractive and implausibly perfect models in adverts and in movies and on TV you are much more likely to see naked or half-naked women than men.这方面的一个例子是广告和媒体，尤其是女性的展示方式。在广告、电影和电视中，你看到裸体或半裸女性的可能性要比男性高得多。 Sam(山姆)Objectification can lead to issues in society such as inequality and discrimination. Objectification of women is a problem but what about the objectification of men?物化会导致社会问题，例如不平等和歧视。物化女性是一个问题，但物化男性呢？ Neil(尼尔)Before we hear more, it’s time for a question. Today’s question is: on British TV in which decade was a completely naked man first seen? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What do you think Sam?在我们听到更多之前，是时候提出一个问题了。今天的问题是：在英国电视上，第一次看到一个全裸的男人是在哪个十年里？是不是……a） 1940 年代；b） 1950 年代 c） 1960 年代 你怎么看 Sam？ Sam(山姆)I’m going for the 60s.我要去 60 年代。 Neil(尼尔)I’ll give the answer later in the programme. Now Sam, do you know the TV programme Love Island?我将在节目的后面给出答案。现在山姆，你知道电视节目《爱情岛》吗？ Sam(山姆)Yes, it’s a kind of a dating show and all the contestants - men and women - spend a lot of time in their swimming costumes and they’ve all got perfect bodies.是的，这是一种约会节目，所有的参赛者 - 男人和女人 - 都花了很多时间穿着泳衣，他们都有完美的身材。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, that’s right. It’s a programme that seems equally to objectify men and women equally. But is that a bad thing? Dr Peter Lucas is Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire. He spoke on this topic on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. What does he suggest might be the advantage of featuring men with ‘perfect’ bodies?是的，没错。这个节目似乎平等地物化了男性和女性。但这是一件坏事吗？Peter Lucas 博士是中央兰开夏大学哲学高级讲师。他在 BBC 的 Woman’s Hour 节目中谈到了这个话题。他认为拥有“完美”身材的男性可能有什么优势？ Dr Peter Lucas(Peter Lucas 博士)If you look at the impact of TV series like Love Island for instance, the producers of that programme present that as, have described that as being aspirational for their audience. It’s presenting role models, its presenting models that people are supposed to aspire to. Now many women, thinking about the male bodies that are on display there might think well, if it means that more men get off to the gym, look after themselves physically, surely that’s a good thing.例如，如果你看一下像《爱情岛》这样的电视剧的影响，该节目的制片人将其描述为对他们的观众来说是令人向往的。它展示了榜样，它展示了人们应该向往的榜样。现在，许多女性，想到那里展示的男性身体，可能会想得很好，如果这意味着更多的男性去健身房，照顾好自己的身体，这肯定是一件好事。 Neil(尼尔)So what might be an advantage of these highly fit athletic bodies on show?那么，这些高度健康的运动身体可能有什么优势呢？ Sam(山姆)Dr Lucas suggests that seeing those bodies might encourage men to go to the gym and work hard to improve their fitness and health and that could be a good thing.卢卡斯博士建议，看到这些身体可能会鼓励男性去健身房并努力改善他们的健康和健康，这可能是一件好事。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, the people in the programme are described as role models. A role model is someone whose behaviour is seen as a good example for others to copy.是的，该计划中的人被描述为榜样。榜样是其行为被视为他人效仿的好榜样的人。 Sam(山姆)I’m not sure the behaviour of the people in Love Island makes them good role models, but perhaps from the point of view of their physical fitness they give us something to aspire to. If you aspire to something, it’s something you can aim for, something you want to achieve. Dr Lucas also used a related word, aspirational. The TV series Love Island was described as being aspirational. It shows a lifestyle that people would like to have, something they might aim to achieve.我不确定《爱情岛》中人们的行为是否使他们成为很好的榜样，但也许从他们的身体健康的角度来看，他们给了我们一些值得向往的东西。如果你渴望某事，那就是你可以瞄准的，你想要实现的。卢卡斯博士还使用了一个相关的词，即 aspirational。电视连续剧《爱情岛》被描述为令人向往。它展示了人们想要拥有的生活方式，他们可能旨在实现的生活方式。 Neil(尼尔)But there are also dangers to encouraging people to get to the gym. Here’s Dr Lucas again.但是，鼓励人们去健身房也有危险。又是 Lucas 博士。 Dr Peter Lucas(Peter Lucas 博士)But also it’s likely to generate higher levels of narcissism, self-consciousness, becoming obsessive about your appearance. It’s not particularly an attractive feature either in men or in women and I suspect that’s impacting on men’s behaviour in a way which is detrimental in the same sort of way that’s been detrimental for women really, for decades.但它也可能会产生更高水平的自恋、自我意识、对自己的外表产生强迫症。无论是在男性还是女性中，这都不是一个特别有吸引力的特征，我怀疑它正在以一种有害的方式影响男性的行为，就像几十年来对女性有害一样。 Neil(尼尔)He talks about behaviour that is detrimental, this means behaviour that has a negative impact. What behaviours does he say are detrimental?他谈到了有害的行为，这意味着具有负面影响的行为。他说哪些行为是有害的？ Sam(山姆)If people become obsessed by their appearance it could lead to narcissism. This is a condition where you spend so much time focussing on yourself, your own looks, your own body that you stop caring about anyone else.如果人们沉迷于自己的外表，可能会导致自恋。在这种情况下，你花了很多时间专注于自己、自己的外表、自己的身体，以至于你不再关心其他人。 Neil(尼尔)And because it’s very very hard to get that kind of body it can also lead to people being very self-conscious. They might become embarrassed about their bodies and lose confidence in themselves as a result.因为要获得这样的身体非常非常困难，它也会导致人们非常自我意识。他们可能会对自己的身体感到尴尬，并因此对自己失去信心。 Right. It’s almost time to review this week’s vocabulary, but before that let’s have the(好的。现在差不多该复习本周的词汇了，但在此之前，让我们先了解)answer to the quiz. In what decade was the first naked man seen on British TV? Was it… a) the 1940s; b) the 1950s c) the 1960s What did you say, Sam?回答测验。英国电视上的第一个裸体男人是在哪个十年里？是不是……a） 1940 年代；b） 1950 年代 c） 1960 年代 山姆，你说什么？ Sam(山姆)I said c) the 60s.我说 c） 60 年代。 Neil(尼尔)I’m afraid the revolution had come earlier than that. The correct answer is the 1950s. It was a 1957 documentary called Out of Step, part of which was filmed at a nudist colony. Now, time for our vocabulary.恐怕革命来得比那更早。正确答案是 1950 年代。这是一部 1957 年的纪录片，名为 Out of Step，其中一部分是在裸体主义者聚居地拍摄的。现在，是时候使用我们的词汇了。 Sam(山姆)Our first word was objectification. This is the noun for when we reduce a human being to an object. We don’t think of them as a real person anymore. The verb is to objectify.我们的第一个词是物化。这是当我们把一个人简化为一个物体时的名词。我们不再将他们视为真实的人。动词是 to objectify。 Neil(尼尔)Someone whose behaviour is a good example that others want to copy is a role model.如果一个人的行为是别人想要效仿的好榜样，那么他就是一个榜样。 Sam(山姆)When it comes to presenting 6 Minute English, you are my role model, Neil.在展示六分钟英语时，您是我的榜样，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)You’re too kind, and I aspire to your level of professionalism, Sam. To aspire to - to aim to be, to hope to achieve.你太善良了，我渴望达到你的专业水平，山姆。渴望 - 以成为为目标，希望实现。 Sam(山姆)That is related to the next word, aspirational. This adjective is used to describe the desire to improve parts of you life - for example, getting a better job or a better body.这与下一个词 aspirational 有关。这个形容词用于描述改善生活某些部分的愿望 - 例如，获得更好的工作或更好的身体。 Aspirational TV programmes or adverts show lifestyles that people might want to be(令人向往的电视节目或广告展示了人们可能想要的生活方式)theirs.他们。 Neil(尼尔)Our next word is an adjective for something that is bad for you, something that has a negative effect. The adjective is detrimental.我们的下一个词是一个形容词，表示对你有害的事物，对你有负面影响的事物。这个形容词是有害的。 Sam(山姆)We heard that aspiring to the perfect body can be detrimental because it might lead to narcissism. Narcissism is the term for someone who is so obsessed with their own body and life that they don’t care about anyone else.我们听说追求完美的身材可能是有害的，因为它可能会导致自恋。自恋是指那些如此痴迷于自己的身体和生活以至于不关心其他人的人。 Neil(尼尔)Achieving that perfect body is incredibly hard and impossible for most real people and not achieving it can make people overly self-conscious - which in this situation means that they can lose confidence in themselves.对于大多数真实的人来说，实现完美的身体是非常困难和不可能的，不达到它会使人们过度自我意识 —— 在这种情况下，这意味着他们会对自己失去信心。 Sam(山姆)That’s all we have time for today.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. NeilNow Rob, how creative are you? RobVery creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now. NeilYou are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively. RobCreativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer? NeilYes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl. RobI can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl. NeilOK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob! RobOf course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools? Bernadette Duffy, early years consultantWe focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future. NeilSo Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills. RobSo we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things. NeilBernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’. RobWell, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’. NeilRob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?! RobWell, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest? Nick Skillicorn, Innovation ManagerOn a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas. NeilSo we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas. RobDisparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions. NeilWell, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital. RobRight, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now. NeilAh yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl. RobAnd I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon. NeilNot quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted! RobWow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising. NeilThen we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably. RobNext we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal. NeilWe also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob! RobThanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated. And we talked about headspace, which is when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. NeilBefore we head off to find some headspace, don’t forget to visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more great learning English content. That’s all we have time for now. Do join us again though. Goodbye. RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Now Rob, how creative are you?现在 罗伯，你的创意如何？ Rob(罗伯)Very creative, I think. Creativity is in my bones! Look at this wonderful script that I wrote and we’re presenting right now.我认为非常有创意。创造力就在我的骨子里！看看我写的这个精彩的剧本，我们现在正在展示。 Neil(尼尔)You are what we could call ‘a creative’ – a noun which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas. In our job we have to create – or make – content that teaches English creatively.您就是我们可以称之为“创意者”的人 —— 一个名词，意思是具有丰富想象力和想法的人。在我们的工作中，我们必须创建或制作具有创造性英语教学的内容。 Rob(罗伯)Creativity is becoming more important for everyone. The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020, creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs. This is particularly relevant for younger people who will be entering the world of work soon – and that’s what we’ll be discussing today. But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?创造力对每个人来说都变得越来越重要。世界经济论坛预测，到 2020 年，创造力将成为未来工作最重要的三大技能之一。这对于即将进入职场的年轻人尤其重要，这就是我们今天要讨论的内容。但在我们这样做之前，Neil，您是否提出了一个问题让我们回答？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, and it’s about the very creative artist Banksy. He created a well-known piece of artwork that has been in the news recently, but do you know what it is called? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon Girl.是的，这是关于非常有创造力的艺术家 Banksy 的。他创作了一件最近上了新闻的著名艺术品，但你知道它叫什么吗？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。 Rob(罗伯)I can see the picture in my head – so I think it’s c) Balloon Girl.我可以在脑海中看到这幅画 —— 所以我认为它是 c） Balloon Girl。 Neil(尼尔)OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about creativity. Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity to help them get a job. That’s perhaps surprising in the UK, when some of our creative industries – that’s businesses that make music, art and TV for example – are world famous. We are creative people, Rob!好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于创造力的讨论。专家表示，学生需要更多地关注创造力，以帮助他们找到工作。这在英国可能很令人惊讶，因为我们的一些创意产业 —— 例如制作音乐、艺术和电视的企业 —— 举世闻名。我们是有创造力的人，罗伯！ Rob(罗伯)Of course, but there’s not such a focus on being creative in education now and that might have an effect in the future. It’s something Bernadette Duffy, an early years consultant, has been discussing on BBC Radio 4’s Bringing up Britain programme. What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?当然，但现在没有那么注重教育的创造力，这可能会在未来产生影响。这是早期教育顾问伯纳黛特·达菲 在 BBC Radio 4 的“培养英国”节目中一直在讨论的问题。她说我们在学校里太关注什么了？ Bernadette Duffy, early years consultant(Bernadette Duffy，早期教育顾问)We focus on the things that are legitimately important but we teach them in a way that makes them easier to measure. I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on gaining the skills and far far more on actually using them in a creative way because that’s what’s going to make a difference for the future.我们专注于合法重要的事情，但我们以一种更容易衡量的方式教授它们。我认为我们需要纠正这种平衡，这种平衡将重点纯粹放在获得技能上，而更多地放在以创造性的方式实际使用它们上，因为这将对未来产生影响。 Neil(尼尔)So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested. She says we teach these skills legitimately – which here means fairly and reasonably. But she feels we don’t teach a creative approach to learning skills.因此，Bernadette 认为我们以一种易于衡量和测试的方式教授技能。她说，我们合法地教授这些技能 —— 这里的意思是公平合理的。但她认为我们没有教授一种创造性的方法来学习技能。 Rob(罗伯)So we mean things like problem solving. I guess, even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets can be approached creatively. In any job, it’s sometimes good to ‘think outside the box’ or find new ways of doing things.所以我们指的是解决问题之类的事情。我想，即使是数据输入和准备电子表格等任务也可以创造性地完成。在任何工作中，有时“跳出框框思考”或寻找新的做事方式都是好的。 Neil(尼尔)Bernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills and start using these skills creatively – she used the expression ‘redress the balance’ which means ‘change things to make them fairer and more equal’.Bernadette 认为我们应该从仅仅学习技能开始创造性地使用这些技能 —— 她使用了“redress the balance”这个词，意思是“改变事物，让它们更公平、更平等”。 Rob(罗伯)Well, here at the BBC we have to creative. In fact one of our values states that ‘creativity is the lifeblood of our organisation’. Lifeblood here means ‘the most important thing to make something a success’.好吧，在 BBC，我们必须发挥创造力。事实上，我们的价值观之一就是“创造力是我们组织的命脉”。Lifeblood 在这里的意思是“使某事成功最重要的事情”。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, I can see creativity is in your blood – but on an everyday level how can we all improve our creativity – be like you?!罗伯，我能看出创造力流淌在你的血液中 —— 但在日常层面上，我们如何才能提高我们的创造力 —— 像你一样？！ Rob(罗伯)Well, Neil, I’m no expert but Innovation Manager, Nick Skillicorn is. He’s also been speaking to the BBC and explaining what we can do to help ourselves. What does he suggest?好吧，Neil，我不是专家，但创新经理 Nick Skillicorn 是。他还一直在接受 BBC 的采访，解释我们可以做些什么来帮助自己。他建议什么呢？ Nick Skillicorn, Innovation Manager(Nick Skillicorn，创新经理)On a daily basis, everyone should take fifteen minutes of what I call unfocused time – time that they’re not looking at any screen, time that they can essentially get back into their own head, slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections between disparate ideas that result in divergent new original ideas.每天，每个人都应该花 15 分钟我所说的无重点时间 —— 他们不看任何屏幕的时间，他们基本上可以回到自己的脑海中，放慢一点速度，开始在不同的想法之间形成这些新的联系，从而导致不同的新原创想法。 Neil(尼尔)So we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head – what Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas.因此，我们需要空闲时间在脑海中收集所有不同的想法 —— Nick 称之为不同的想法，以创造新的和令人惊叹的想法。 Rob(罗伯)Disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated. And we need what we might call headspace – that’s when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly. For me, I have headspace when I’m lying in the bath or out riding my bike – there are no interruptions.不同的想法是截然不同的想法，都是不相关的。我们需要我们所谓的头脑空间 – 那时你的大脑处于良好的状态，你可以清晰地思考。对我来说，当我躺在浴缸里或骑自行车时，我有头部空间 —— 不会被打扰。 Neil(尼尔)Well, you certainly don’t get your ideas sitting at a desk, focusing on one task – we all need some downtime to get creative. But children going into school now will grow up to do a job that doesn’t yet exist. And faced with the challenges of AI, automation, green issues and an ageing population, creativity and imagination will be vital.好吧，你肯定不会把你的想法放在办公桌前，专注于一项任务 —— 我们都需要一些休息时间来发挥创意。但是现在上学的孩子长大后会从事一份尚不存在的工作。面对人工智能、自动化、绿色问题和人口老龄化的挑战，创造力和想象力将至关重要。 Rob(罗伯)Right, well, let’s get back to talking about the creativity of Banksy now.好了，好吧，现在让我们回到 Banksy 的创造力上来。 Neil(尼尔)Ah yes, because earlier I asked you which one of his well-known pieces of artwork has been in the news recently? Is it… a) Girl with Balloon; b) Girl with Red Balloon c) Balloon girl.啊，是的，因为之前我问你最近他的哪一件知名作品上了新闻？是吗。。。a） 带气球的女孩；b） 带红气球的女孩 c） 气球女孩。 Rob(罗伯)And I said c) Balloon Girl. I know it was a girl and a balloon.我说 c） 气球女孩。我知道那是一个女孩和一个气球。 Neil(尼尔)Not quite right, Rob. The artwork is titled ‘Girl with Balloon.’ This was recently auctioned in London but amazingly shredded in its frame as someone’s winning bid was accepted!不太对劲，罗伯。这件作品的标题是“带气球的女孩”。这辆车最近在伦敦拍卖，但令人惊讶的是，由于有人的中标被接受，它被撕碎了！ Rob(罗伯)Wow, that’s a very creative way to destroy a picture! I will do the same with this script soon but not before we have recapped some of today’s vocabulary. Starting with ‘a creative’ - a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination and come up with new ideas, such as someone who works in the media or advertising.哇，这是一种非常有创意的销毁图片的方法！我很快就会对这个脚本做同样的事情，但在此之前，我们会回顾一下今天的一些词汇。从“创意人员”开始 - 其工作是发挥大量想象力并提出新想法的人，例如在媒体或广告行业工作的人。 Neil(尼尔)Then we mentioned legitimately – which describes doing something fairly and reasonably.然后我们提到了 legimately – 它描述了公平合理地做某事。 Rob(罗伯)Next we heard the expression ‘redress the balance’. This means to make things fairer and more equal.接下来，我们听到了“redress the balance”这个说法。这意味着让事情变得更公平、更平等。 Neil(尼尔)We also talked about creativity being the lifeblood of the BBC. Lifeblood here means the most important thing to make something a success. And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob!我们还谈到了创造力是 BBC 的命脉。Lifeblood 在这里意味着使某事成功最重要的事情。我知道创造力在你的血管中流淌，罗伯！ Rob(罗伯)Thanks, Neil. We also heard the word disparate, meaning very different and unrelated. And we talked about headspace, which is when your mind is in a good state and you can think clearly.谢谢，Neil。我们还听到了 disparate 这个词，意思是非常不同且不相关。我们谈到了顶空，即当你的大脑处于良好状态并且可以清晰思考时。 Neil(尼尔)Before we head off to find some headspace, don’t forget to visit our website at bbclearningenglish.com for more great learning English content.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. CatherineNow Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop? RobYes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity. CatherineExactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement? RobIt should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please! CatherineIt’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968? RobI’ll go for 1948. CatherineOK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too. RobIt’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd! CatherineWell, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start? Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily MirrorWell I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things. RobOK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style. CatherineYes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation. RobYes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends. CatherineWell Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress? RobOK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend? Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily MirrorIt’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there. RobWow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. CatherineNo don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing. RobAnd I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money. CatherineThe issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it. RobWell if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do. CatherineAnd there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? RobAnd I said 1948. CatherineAnd you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece. RobVery interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’. CatherineThen we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation. RobWe also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends. CatherineRummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’. RobWell you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Catherine。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop?现在 罗伯，你有没有在慈善商店买过东西？ Rob(罗伯)Yes I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain and I also donate items to charity shops too. And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them and makes money and the money goes to the charity.是的，我愿意。他们是讨价还价的好地方，我也向慈善商店捐赠物品。顺便说一句，慈善商店是人们拿走他们不需要的物品，然后商店出售它们并赚钱的商店，这些钱捐给了慈善机构。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Exactly that’s good to hear Rob, because donating – that’s giving money or goods to an organisation – helps charities raise money. And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of - and that’s what we’re discussing today – is looking like you’re dressing in charity shops clothes a new fashion statement?“ 听到 罗伯 说这句话真是太好了，因为捐赠 —— 即向组织提供资金或物品 —— 有助于慈善机构筹集资金。您可能有兴趣知道，穿着二手衣服又回来了 —— 嗯 —— 这就是我们今天要讨论的内容 —— 看起来像你在慈善商店穿衣服是一种新的时尚宣言吗？ Rob(罗伯)It should be interesting but first Catherine, aren’t you going to set me a question to answer – and not a second-hand one please!这应该很有趣，但首先，凯瑟琳，你不打算给我一个问题来回答吗 —— 请不要是二手问题！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)It’s a brand new question today Rob, for you and the listeners at home – do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK? Was it in… a) 1928; b) 1948, or c) 1968?罗伯，今天对于您和家里的听众来说，这是一个全新的问题 —— 您知道英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的吗？是在……a） 1928 年；b） 1948 年，还是 c） 1968 年？ Rob(罗伯)I’ll go for 1948.我会选择 1948 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)OK, and we’ll find out the answer later. But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion. And there’s a new look in town, which some people are calling ‘scumbro’. Scumbro combines the word ‘scummy’ which means ‘dirty and messy’ with the word ‘bro’, which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too.好的，我们稍后会找出答案。但现在回到我们关于慈善商店和时尚的讨论。镇上出现了一种新的面貌，有些人称之为 “scumbro”。Scumbro 将“scummy”一词与“bro”一词相结合，“bro”一词是称呼男孩或男人的非正式方式。所以 scumbro 是男性的时尚 —— 但女性也可以采用它。 Rob(罗伯)It’s a bit of an insulting name and here’s the odd thing about this new fashion style: Being scumbro is about buying expensive designer-brands that look like they are from a charity shop. Very odd!这个名字有点侮辱人，这种新时尚风格的奇怪之处在于：成为渣男就是购买昂贵的设计师品牌，这些品牌看起来像是来自慈善商店的。很奇怪！ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, it’s something Amber Graafland knows about. She is the Fashion &amp; Beauty Director for the Daily Mirror newspaper and she’s been telling BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme all about it. So, how did this trend start?嗯，这是 Amber Graafland 知道的事情。她是每日镜报的时尚与美容总监，她一直在向BBC广播4台的You and Yours节目讲述这一切。那么，这种趋势是如何开始的呢？ Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)Well I think the name came from a Vanity Fair article, and I think Justin Bieber, the likes of Jonah Hill to thank for this look, Pete Davidson, who’s actually the fiancée of Ariana Grande – he’s definitely one of the founding fathers of scumbro. And I think, like most of these trends, they’re started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it’s been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things.嗯，我认为这个名字来自《名利场》的一篇文章，我想贾斯汀·比伯，要感谢乔纳·希尔等人，皮特·戴维森，他实际上是阿丽亚娜·格兰德的未婚妻 —— 他绝对是渣男的创始人之一。我认为，就像大多数这些趋势一样，它们是由名人发起的，然后，我的意思是，它已经被每个人的声音所接受。 Rob(罗伯)OK, so the fashion magazine Vanity Fair invented the name but the trend has spread because celebrities have been dressing in this style.好吧，时尚杂志《名利场》发明了这个名字，但这种趋势已经蔓延开来，因为名人一直在穿着这种风格。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities who are the founding fathers of the trend – that’s a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.Yes and Amber 提到了一些名人，他们是这一趋势的奠基人 —— 这是一个用来描述提出想法或组织的人的术语。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, the trend has been picked up – or copied - by people who you might describe as fashion victims – people who have to follow the latest fashion trends.是的，这种趋势已经被你描述为时尚受害者的人所接受或复制 —— 他们必须追随最新的时尚潮流。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well Rob, I’m no fashion victim – but I say, maybe, one day, I might want to look scumbro – or maybe scumsis! So how exactly should I dress?好吧，罗伯，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 但我说，也许，有一天，我可能想看起来渣男 —— 或者可能是渣男！那么我到底应该怎么着装呢？ Rob(罗伯)OK, well let’s hear from Amber Graafland again. How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend?好的，让我们再次听到 Amber Graafland 的声音。她如何描述这种时尚潮流的特点？ Amber Graafland, Fashion &amp; Beauty Director, Daily Mirror(Amber Graafland，时尚与美容总监，每日镜报)It’s all about wearing these oversized clothes that are overpriced and I think it’s not just about looking like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it’s basically about looking simultaneously like you’ve made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there.这一切都与穿着这些价格过高的超大号衣服有关，我认为这不仅仅是看起来像你在青少年的装扮盒中翻找过。这些都是非常非常昂贵的商品 —— 你提到了 Prada、Versace、Gucci、Supreme 等品牌 —— 虽然基本上看起来你没有付出任何努力，但潜在的问题是你确实需要看到努力已经在那里。 Rob(罗伯)Wow, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort! It’s not just about looking messy – like you’ve rummaged in a teenager’s dressing up box. Rummaging is when you search for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things.哇，这种时尚趋势确实需要付出很多努力！这不仅仅是看起来凌乱 —— 就像你在青少年的装扮盒里翻找一样。翻找是指您搜索与许多其他事物混合在一起的东西。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)No don’t be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you’ve not made any effort but at the same time, you’re show you have made an effort! And that’s the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing.不，不要翻找！诀窍似乎是看起来你没有付出任何努力，但与此同时，你表明你已经付出了努力！这就是这个词的含义 – 同时做一件事和另一件事。 Rob(罗伯)And I guess by showing you’ve made an effort, you wear designer labels – showing you’ve paid lots of money.我想，通过表明你付出了努力，你佩戴了名牌 —— 表明你付出了很多钱。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)The issue here is clothes from charity shops are supposed to be cheap. Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they’re wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren’t making any money from it.这里的问题是慈善商店的衣服应该很便宜。有些人甚至购买这些衣服，因为这是他们能负担得起的 —— 但具有讽刺意味的是，有些人选择花很多很多钱来看起来像他们穿着二手衣服 —— 而慈善商店并没有从中赚到任何钱。 Rob(罗伯)Well if you’re a fashion victim it’s something you have to do.好吧，如果你是时尚界的受害者，这是你必须做的事情。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And there’s one thing I have to do now and that’s give you the answer to today’s quiz question. So I asked you earlier when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK?我现在必须做一件事，那就是给你今天测验问题的答案。所以我刚才问你，英国第一家官方慈善商店是什么时候开业的？ Rob(罗伯)And I said 1948.我说的是 1948 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And you are correct this week Rob. Well done! The very first shop, run by the charity Oxfam, opened its doors in Oxford in 1948, as a direct result of an appeal launched to help post-war Greece.本周你是对的，罗伯。干的好！第一家商店由慈善机构乐施会经营，于 1948 年在牛津开业，这是为了帮助战后希腊而发起的呼吁的直接结果。 Rob(罗伯)Very interesting. Right, let’s remind ourselves of some of today’s vocabulary, starting with the word donating which means ‘giving goods or money to an organisation or charity’.非常有趣。好吧，让我们提醒自己今天的一些词汇，从“捐赠”这个词开始，意思是“向组织或慈善机构捐赠物品或金钱”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Then we mentioned founding fathers - a term used to describe people who start an idea or an organisation.然后我们提到了开国元勋 —— 一个用来描述发起一个想法或组织的人的术语。 Rob(罗伯)We also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim – a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends.我们还提到，Catherine 不是时尚的受害者 —— 一个必须追随最新时尚潮流的人。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Rummaging was a word that described searching for something that’s mixed up with lots of other things. And then we had simultaneously which means ‘doing one thing at the same time as doing something else’.Rummaging 这个词形容寻找与许多其他事物混在一起的东西。然后我们有了 同时，这意味着“在做一件事的同时做另一件事”。 Rob(罗伯)Well you can simultaneously listen to this programme and look at our website if you like.

I’m Neil. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. NeilToday we’re talking about plastic. RobYes, it’s our addiction to plastic that is of concern because this material doesn’t decay very quickly, so once we’ve used it; it hangs around for a very long time. NeilIt is a problem – and decay, by the way, describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles. We hear so much about the consequences of having too much waste plastic around, don’t we? RobIndeed. Not only does it cause a mess - wildlife, particularly marine animals, are at risk when they become entangled in plastic waste, or ingest it. It’s an issue that needs tackling – or dealing with. And that’s what we’ll be discussing today and finding out what could be done to solve this plastic crisis. NeilOK, first, let’s challenge you to answer a question about plastic, Rob. The first synthetic plastic – that’s plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. Do you know what its brand name was? Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica? RobI’m no expert, so I’ll say c) Formica. NeilWell, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about plastic. This man-mad substance is everywhere - from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets. RobBut the problem is that most of it isn’t biodegradable – that’s a word that describes something that can decay naturally without harming anything. Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single-use. So why don’t we stop using it? NeilIt’s not that easy, Rob, and it’s something Lucy Siegle, a BBC reporter and author, has been talking about. She was speaking in a discussion on the Costing the Earth programme on BBC Radio 4, and explained the issue we have with quitting plastic but also how our attitude is changing… Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and authorWe have this weird psychological attachment to this material that’s been around and it’s like a push and pull. At the one time, we’re so horrified by what we’re seeing – the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic, beaming in from all over the world, and at the same time we’re being told we can’t live without it, so that creates a psychological dissonance –which I think is the barrier to behavioural change but I’m finding now awareness has peaked and it’s going over into activism. RobShe mentioned the word psychological – that’s something that affects or involves our mind – so here, psychological attachment means that in our mind we feel we have to use plastic – we’re addicted. NeilBut we also see the negative impact of plastic – like whales dying – and in our mind we’re also thinking we must stop! This has created what Lucy says is a ‘psychological dissonance’ - dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas – so we’re having an argument in our head about the right thing to do – this is the ‘push and pull’ of thoughts she referred to. RobAnd this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue – but now we’re starting to do something about it – we’re taking action to reduce our plastic waste – we’re turning to activism. That’s taking action to change something – it could be social or political change, or a change in our behaviour or attitude. NeilOf course there has been a big push – that means people have been strongly encouraged – to recycle. RobMaybe in an ideal world the best thing to do is go plastic-free – but that isn’t easy, is it? NeilNo, it isn’t, and it’s something Lucy Siegle spoke about. Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process. But where does she think we can make the biggest difference? Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and authorI really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life is easier and more effective in the long term, than trying to go plastic-free from the outset. We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture. RobShe says we have a supermarket culture in the UK. Culture here describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave – and in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets. NeilSo, for example, customers can make a big difference by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging. It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands – we need to be more careful about how and when we use it – and use our collective power to force change if it’s needed. RobBut there’s no doubt plastic is useful for many things so it will be a long time before it disappears altogether. NeilAnd earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic, invented over a 100 years ago. Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica? RobAnd I said c) Formica. Was I right? NeilFormica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas in kitchens – but it’s not the oldest type. That was Bakelite. RobI may have got that wrong but hopefully I’ll have more success recapping some of today’s vocabulary – starting with decay, which describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles – which plastic takes a long time to do. NeilNext we had biodegradable – that’s a word to describe something that can decay naturally without harming anything. RobThen we had psychological – that’s something that affects or involves your mind. NeilNext up, we had dissonance, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas. RobAnd then we mentioned activism - that’s taking action to change something.

NeilGoodbye. 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟 English。我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Today we’re talking about plastic.今天我们谈论的是塑料。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, it’s our addiction to plastic that is of concern because this material doesn’t decay very quickly, so once we’ve used it; it hangs around for a very long time.是的，我们对塑料的依赖令人担忧，因为这种材料不会很快腐烂，所以一旦我们用过它；它会存在很长时间。 Neil(尼尔)It is a problem – and decay, by the way, describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles. We hear so much about the consequences of having too much waste plastic around, don’t we?这是一个问题 —— 顺便说一句，衰变描述了某物被破坏或分解成小颗粒的自然过程。我们听到了很多关于周围有太多废塑料的后果，不是吗？ Rob(罗伯)Indeed. Not only does it cause a mess - wildlife, particularly marine animals, are at risk when they become entangled in plastic waste, or ingest it. It’s an issue that needs tackling – or dealing with. And that’s what we’ll be discussing today and finding out what could be done to solve this plastic crisis.事实上。它不仅会造成混乱 —— 野生动物，尤其是海洋动物，当它们被塑料垃圾缠住或摄入时，它们就会处于危险之中。这是一个需要解决或处理的问题。这就是我们今天要讨论的内容，并找出可以做些什么来解决这场塑料危机。 Neil(尼尔)OK, first, let’s challenge you to answer a question about plastic, Rob. The first synthetic plastic – that’s plastic made entirely from man-made materials - was created over 100 years ago. Do you know what its brand name was? Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica?好的，首先，让我们挑战您回答一个关于塑料的问题，罗伯。第一种合成塑料 - 完全由人造材料制成的塑料 - 是在 100 多年前创造的。你知道它的品牌名称是什么吗？是不是……a） 电木；b） 有机玻璃还是 c） 富美家？ Rob(罗伯)I’m no expert, so I’ll say c) Formica.我不是专家，所以我会说 c） 富美家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about plastic. This man-mad substance is everywhere - from clothing to crisp packets, and bottles to buckets.好吧，我们将在节目结束时揭晓答案。现在让我们更多地谈谈塑料。这种让人疯狂的物质无处不在 —— 从衣服到薯片包，从瓶子到桶。 Rob(罗伯)But the problem is that most of it isn’t biodegradable – that’s a word that describes something that can decay naturally without harming anything. Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single-use. So why don’t we stop using it?但问题是，其中大部分是不可生物降解的 —— 这个词用来描述可以自然腐烂而不会伤害任何东西的东西。每年生产 4 亿吨塑料，其中 40% 是一次性塑料。那么，我们为什么不停止使用它呢？ Neil(尼尔)It’s not that easy, Rob, and it’s something Lucy Siegle, a BBC reporter and author, has been talking about. She was speaking in a discussion on the Costing the Earth programme on BBC Radio 4, and explained the issue we have with quitting plastic but also how our attitude is changing…这并不容易，罗伯，这是 BBC 记者兼作家 Lucy Sigle 一直在谈论的事情。她在 BBC Radio 4 的 Costing the Earth 节目的讨论中发表了讲话，并解释了我们戒除塑料的问题，以及我们的态度是如何改变的…… Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and author(露西·西格尔，BBC记者兼作家)We have this weird psychological attachment to this material that’s been around and it’s like a push and pull. At the one time, we’re so horrified by what we’re seeing – the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic, beaming in from all over the world, and at the same time we’re being told we can’t live without it, so that creates a psychological dissonance –which I think is the barrier to behavioural change but I’m finding now awareness has peaked and it’s going over into activism.我们对这种一直存在的材料有一种奇怪的心理依恋，它就像一种推拉。曾经，我们对所看到的感到非常震惊 —— 鲸鱼死亡，海洋吐出塑料，从世界各地涌入，与此同时，我们被告知我们不能没有它，所以这造成了心理上的不和谐 —— 我认为这是行为改变的障碍，但我发现现在意识已经达到顶峰，并且正在转变为行动主义。 Rob(罗伯)She mentioned the word psychological – that’s something that affects or involves our mind – so here, psychological attachment means that in our mind we feel we have to use plastic – we’re addicted.她提到了心理这个词 – 这是影响或涉及我们思想的东西 – 所以在这里，心理依恋意味着在我们的思想中，我们觉得我们必须使用塑料 – 我们上瘾了。 Neil(尼尔)But we also see the negative impact of plastic – like whales dying – and in our mind we’re also thinking we must stop! This has created what Lucy says is a ‘psychological dissonance’ - dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas – so we’re having an argument in our head about the right thing to do – this is the ‘push and pull’ of thoughts she referred to.但我们也看到了塑料的负面影响 —— 就像鲸鱼死亡一样 —— 在我们心中，我们也在想我们必须停止！这造成了露西所说的“心理失调” —— 不调是指两个对立的想法之间的分歧 —— 所以我们在脑海中争论如何做 —— 这就是她提到的思想的“推拉”。 Rob(罗伯)And this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue – but now we’re starting to do something about it – we’re taking action to reduce our plastic waste – we’re turning to activism. That’s taking action to change something – it could be social or political change, or a change in our behaviour or attitude.这种不和谐一直是我们试图解决塑料问题的障碍 —— 但现在我们开始采取行动 —— 我们正在采取行动减少塑料垃圾 —— 我们正在转向行动主义。这就是采取行动来改变某事 —— 它可以是社会或政治变化，或者是我们行为或态度的改变。 Neil(尼尔)Of course there has been a big push – that means people have been strongly encouraged – to recycle.当然，已经有很大的推动力 —— 这意味着人们受到了强烈的鼓励 —— 回收利用。 Rob(罗伯)Maybe in an ideal world the best thing to do is go plastic-free – but that isn’t easy, is it?也许在理想情况下，最好的办法是无塑料 —— 但这并不容易，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)No, it isn’t, and it’s something Lucy Siegle spoke about. Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process. But where does she think we can make the biggest difference?不，不是，这是 Lucy Siegle 谈到的事情。在我们的生活中摆脱塑料是一个循序渐进的过程。但她认为我们可以在哪些方面做出最大的改变呢？ Lucy Siegle, BBC reporter and author(露西·西格尔，BBC记者兼作家)I really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life is easier and more effective in the long term, than trying to go plastic-free from the outset. We are in the UK, a supermarket culture, so a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic are getting round supermarket culture.我真的认为，从长远来看，专注于阻止塑料流入您的生活比从一开始就尝试无塑料更容易、更有效。我们身处英国，拥有一种超市文化，因此许多减少塑料流动的技巧和窍门都在超市文化中得到传播。 Rob(罗伯)She says we have a supermarket culture in the UK. Culture here describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave – and in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets.她说我们在英国有一种超市文化。这里的文化描述了一种生活方式 —— 或者我们通常的行为方式 —— 就食品购买而言，我们倾向于在超市里这样做。 Neil(尼尔)So, for example, customers can make a big difference by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging. It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands – we need to be more careful about how and when we use it – and use our collective power to force change if it’s needed.因此，例如，客户可以通过向超市施加压力，要求他们减少使用塑料包装，从而产生很大的不同。塑料的未来似乎确实掌握在我们手中 —— 我们需要更加谨慎地使用塑料的方式和时间 —— 并在需要时利用我们的集体力量来推动变革。 Rob(罗伯)But there’s no doubt plastic is useful for many things so it will be a long time before it disappears altogether.但毫无疑问，塑料对很多东西都有用，所以它完全消失还需要很长时间。 Neil(尼尔)And earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic, invented over a 100 years ago. Was it… a) Bakelite; b) Lucite or c) Formica?早些时候，我问你 100 多年前发明的第一种合成塑料叫什么名字。是不是……a） 电木；b） 有机玻璃还是 c） 富美家？ Rob(罗伯)And I said c) Formica. Was I right?我说 c） 富美家。我是对的吗？ Neil(尼尔)Formica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas in kitchens – but it’s not the oldest type. That was Bakelite.富美家是一种用于覆盖厨房桌子和工作区域的硬塑料 —— 但它并不是最古老的类型。那就是电木。 Rob(罗伯)I may have got that wrong but hopefully I’ll have more success recapping some of today’s vocabulary – starting with decay, which describes the natural process of something being destroyed or breaking down into small particles – which plastic takes a long time to do.我可能弄错了，但希望我能更成功地重述今天的一些词汇 —— 从衰变开始，它描述了某物被破坏或分解成小颗粒的自然过程 —— 塑料需要很长时间才能完成。 Neil(尼尔)Next we had biodegradable – that’s a word to describe something that can decay naturally without harming anything.接下来是可生物降解的 —— 这个词用来描述可以自然腐烂而不会伤害任何东西的东西。 Rob(罗伯)Then we had psychological – that’s something that affects or involves your mind.然后我们有了心理 – 这是影响或涉及你的思想的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Next up, we had dissonance, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas.接下来，我们有 Dissonance，它描述了两个对立想法之间的分歧。 Rob(罗伯)And then we mentioned activism - that’s taking action to change something. We also mentioned the phrase a big push which means people are strongly encouraged or persuaded to do something, usefully by force.然后我们提到了行动主义 —— 即采取行动来改变某些事情。我们还提到了 a big push 这个词，意思是人们被强烈鼓励或说服去做某事，通过武力做某事。 Neil(尼尔)And finally we had culture. In our context of supermarket culture, it describes a way of life – or a way that we generally behave.最后，我们有了文化。在我们超市文化的背景下，它描述了一种生活方式 —— 或者我们通常的行为方式。 Rob(罗伯)Thanks, Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, what generation are you? RobWell what are my choices? NeilYou can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born. RobOh, OK then, what are the different generations? NeilWell, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and … RobOK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties? NeilYou’re very smart. So, which one are you? RobAh, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil? NeilYes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media. RobOh, poor them! NeilMmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer? RobWell, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties. NeilWe’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different? Hiral PatelMost people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them. NeilSo Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations? RobYes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences. NeilAnd this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want. RobAnd she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers. NeilIt’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy. RobAnd being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge. NeilNow I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again: Hiral PatelMost people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them. NeilRight time to review this week’s vocabulary, but first let’s have an answer to that quiz. In what decade was the term ‘social media’ first coined? Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties What did you say Rob? RobYeah, well I said c) the noughties. NeilYou’re wrong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary. RobYes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years. NeilAnd we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009. RobThe next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market. NeilAnd if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable. RobThis makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy. NeilWell that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, what generation are you?罗伯，你是哪一代人？ Rob(罗伯)Well what are my choices?那么我有哪些选择呢？ Neil(尼尔)You can’t choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born.你不能选择你是哪一代，这取决于你是什么时候出生的。 Rob(罗伯)Oh, OK then, what are the different generations?哦，好吧，有哪些不同的世代呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well, there are baby boomers, who were born in between the 1940s and the early 1960s. Then there was Generation X, born between the mid1960s and the early 1980s. Then there is Generation Y, also known as millennials, born mid 1980s to late 1990s, and …嗯，有婴儿潮一代，他们出生于 1940 年代到 1960 年代初之间。然后是 X 世代，出生于 1960 年代中期至 1980 年代初之间。然后是 Y 世代，也被称为千禧一代，出生于 1980 年代中期至 1990 年代后期，以及…… Rob(罗伯)OK, let me guess, Generation Z? Born in the late nineties or early noughties?好吧，让我猜猜，Z 世代？出生于 90 年代末还是 90 年代初？ Neil(尼尔)You’re very smart. So, which one are you?你很聪明。那么，你是哪一个呢？ Rob(罗伯)Ah, that would give away my age wouldn’t it! OK, I have to confess I am Generation X. And what about you Neil?啊，那会暴露我的年龄，不是吗！好吧，我不得不承认我是 X 世代。那你呢，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes me too, Generation X. But today we’re going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z. What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation. They have never known a time without social media.是的，我也是，X 世代。但今天我们将关注 Z 世代，也称为 Z 世代。Z 世代的特别之处在于他们是社交媒体一代。他们从未经历过没有社交媒体的时代。 Rob(罗伯)Oh, poor them!哦，可怜的他们！ Neil(尼尔)Mmm, well, that’s one view. Other opinions are available. Before we look at Gen-Z in more detail, a question though. No one can quite agree on who first used the term ‘social media’, but we do know from which decade it came. Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties, that is the first decade of the 21st Century. Rob, what’s your answer?嗯，嗯，这是一种观点。其他意见也可用。在我们更详细地研究 Z 世代之前，有一个问题。没有人能完全同意谁首先使用“社交媒体”这个词，但我们确实知道它来自哪个十年。是：a） 1980 年代；b） 1990 年代 c） 新世纪，即 21 世纪的第一个十年。罗伯，你的答案是什么？ Rob(罗伯)Well, come on, it’s quite a recent thing. It’s got to be c) the noughties.嗯，拜托，这是最近的事情。它必须是 c） 新世纪。 Neil(尼尔)We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now we’re going to hear from Hiral Patel who is an analyst for Barclays. She appeared on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and was asked whether there was much difference between millennials and Generation Z. Does she think they are the same or different?我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，我们将听取巴克莱银行分析师 Hiral Patel 的发言。她出现在 BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目中，并被问及千禧一代和 Z 世代之间是否有太大差异。她认为它们是相同的还是不同的？ Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for. Our research found that Gen Z are tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers, and extremely savvy. This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.大多数人将 Z 世代视为迷你千禧一代 —— 那是因为人们对“千禧一代”这个词很着迷。我们的研究表明，Z 世代是不同的，他们有自己的一套价值观和偏好，消费品牌需要迎合这些价值观和偏好。我们的研究发现，Z 世代是天生的技术型、消息灵通的消费者，而且非常精明。我们今天生活的这个高度互联的世界对他们来说是一种新常态。 Neil(尼尔)So Rob, does Hiral Patel think there is much difference between the two generations?那么 罗伯，Hiral Patel 认为这两代人之间有很大差异吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, she does. But she comments that not everyone does. Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people. Gen-Z, she says are not mini-millennials, they are quite different and have their own values and preferences.是的，她知道。但她评论说，并不是每个人都这样做。千禧一代是一个被频繁使用的术语，以至于许多人认为它指的是所有年轻人。她说，Z 世代不是迷你千禧一代，他们完全不同，有自己的价值观和偏好。 Neil(尼尔)And this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation. They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want.这对于消费品牌和想要向这一代销售产品的公司来说非常重要。他们需要迎合这一代人的需求，这意味着他们需要提供 Z 世代想要的商品。 Rob(罗伯)And she describes Gen Z as being tech-innate, hyper-informed consumers.她将 Z 世代描述为与生俱来的技术、消息灵通的消费者。 Neil(尼尔)It’s a bit of a mouthful but essentially it means that they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media and as a result have a lot of information about what’s going on in the world. This makes them savvy.这有点拗口，但从本质上讲，这意味着他们对现代技术和社交媒体非常满意，因此有很多关于世界上正在发生的事情的信息。这使他们变得精明。 Rob(罗伯)And being savvy means being able to understand situations well and make clever decisions because of this knowledge.精明意味着能够很好地理解情况并因为这些知识而做出明智的决定。 Neil(尼尔)Now I think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media, but I didn’t grow up with it, it’s new. For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal, it’s all around and always has been, it’s their norm, as Hiral Patel put it. Here she is again:现在我认为我对现代互联技术和媒体非常了解，但我不是伴随着它长大的，它是新的。对于 Z 世代来说，这种技术水平是正常的，正如 Hiral Patel 所说，它无处不在，而且一直都是，这是他们的常态。她又来了： Hiral Patel(希拉尔·帕特尔)Most people view Generation Z as mini-millennials - and that’s because there is an obsession with the word ‘millennial’. Our research shows that Gen Z are different and they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to cater for.

In what decade was the term ‘social media’ first coined? Was it: a) the 1980s; b) the 1990s c) the noughties What did you say Rob?是时候复习本周的词汇了，但首先让我们来回答一下这个测验。“社交媒体”一词最早是在哪个十年创造的？是：a） 1980 年代；b） 1990 年代 c） 新世纪 你说 罗伯 什么？ Rob(罗伯)Yeah, well I said c) the noughties.是的，我说的是 c） 新世纪。 Neil(尼尔)You’re wrong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer. I’m sure most of you got that one correct. Right, now, the vocabulary.你错了。也许不足为奇，1990 年代就是答案。我相信你们中的大多数人都猜对了。好了，现在，词汇。 Rob(罗伯)Yes this week we’ve been talking about generations. This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time, usually, but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years.是的，本周我们一直在谈论几代人。这是一个术语，用于描述在特定时期出生的人，通常但并不总是大约 18 到 20 年。 Neil(尼尔)And we were focussing on Generation Z or Gen Z which includes those born in the early noughties, which is the first decade of the 21st Century from 2000 to 2009.我们专注于 Z 世代或 Z 世代，包括出生在二十世纪初的人，即 21 世纪的第一个十年，从 2000 年到 2009 年。 Rob(罗伯)The next expression was to cater for. This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group. And if you are trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market.下一个表达是迎合。这意味着提供特定群体需要或想要的东西。如果你想卖东西，你需要迎合你的目标市场。 Neil(尼尔)And if your market is Gen Z you need to be aware that they are tech innate, hyper- informed. They have grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable.如果你的市场是 Z 世代，你需要意识到他们是技术天生的，消息灵通。他们在互联技术中长大，知识渊博。 Rob(罗伯)This makes them extremely savvy. This adjective means smart and intelligent. In this context it means they are able to make smart decisions about what to buy because they are connected so many sources of information. And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm. It’s what is normal, what is usual for them. So where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology - for Gen Z, it’s easy.这使他们非常精明。这个形容词的意思是聪明和聪明。在这种情况下，这意味着他们能够对购买什么做出明智的决定，因为他们连接了如此多的信息来源。对于 Z 世代来说，这种水平的互动和连接是常态。这是正常的，对他们来说是正常的。因此，我有时会与现代生活和技术作斗争 —— 对于 Z 世代来说，这很容易。 Neil(尼尔)Well that may be true but I’m savvy enough to know that it’s time to end the programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling. RobNeil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off. NeilAnd a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion. RobWell, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about? NeilOK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s? RobI do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s. NeilWell, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket. RobYes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion. NeilHannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason? Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The GuardianThere’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion. RobSo her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed. NeilAnd these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that! RobHannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction. NeilTraction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front. RobThis raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing? NeilYes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue? Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The GuardianEvery time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there. NeilSo she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work. RobAnd the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily. NeilAnd we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s? RobYes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right! NeilWell, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear. RobOK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil. NeilThey, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed. RobNext we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive. NeilAnd then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss. RobWell, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever. NeilThat’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English. See you soon. Goodbye. RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, it’s good to see you keeping up with fashion by wearing the high-vis jacket – although I have to say it is a bit dazzling.罗伯，很高兴看到你穿着高可见度夹克跟上时尚 —— 尽管我不得不说它有点令人眼花缭乱。 Rob(罗伯)Neil, I’m no fashion victim – this high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety. I wear it when I’m cycling around London and I’ve just forgotten to take it off.Neil，我不是时尚的受害者 —— 这件高可见度或高能见度夹克是为了安全。我在伦敦骑自行车时戴着它，只是忘了摘下它。 Neil(尼尔)And a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement – that’s something you wear to attract attention and people who know something about fashion.顺便说一句，时尚受害者是那些总是穿着被认为是时尚的东西的人，即使它实际上在他们身上看起来并不好。但穿着高可见度的衣服已经成为最新的时尚宣言 —— 这是你穿来吸引注意力和对时尚有所了解的人的东西。 Rob(罗伯)Well, I can assure you, I don’t wear my bright jacket to look cool but in today’s programme we’ll be discussing why some people do. But first Neil, have you got a question for us to think about?好吧，我可以向你保证，我穿上鲜艳的夹克并不是为了看起来很酷，但在今天的节目中，我们将讨论为什么有些人会这样做。但首先，Neil，您有没有一个问题要我们考虑？ Neil(尼尔)OK, we know that fashions come and go but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory? Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the 1990s?好吧，我们知道时尚来来去去，但是在哪个十年里，暖腿套作为流行的时尚配饰佩戴？是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？ Rob(罗伯)I do remember these so I’ll say b) the 1980s.我确实记得这些，所以我会说 b） 1980 年代。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about the oddest item of clothing to hit the catwalk this year - the humble hi-vis jacket.好吧，我们将在节目结束时揭晓答案。现在让我们更多地谈谈今年 T 台上最奇怪的服装 —— 不起眼的高可见度夹克。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they’re working in the road or directing traffic. So it’s strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on-trend – that’s following the latest fashion.是的，为了安全起见，它们被设计为供骑自行车的人和行人以及需要在道路上工作或指挥交通的工人佩戴。所以，现在人们选择穿着它们来紧跟潮流，这很奇怪 —— 这是在追随最新的时尚。 Neil(尼尔)Hannah Marriott is the Fashion Editor of the Guardian newspaper. She told the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours, why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing. What was the reason?Hannah Marriott 是《卫报》的时尚编辑。她告诉 BBC Radio 4 节目 You and Yours，为什么她认为人们会转向明亮、发光的衣服。原因是什么？ Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)There’s also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things, very eye- catching things, it feels that with social media, you know, everyone’s scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed and anything that sort of catches the eye, that seems yeah, like a bit of a talking point, something that’s going to get a bit of attention - those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment - than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion.目前还有一种趋势是，人们穿着非常明亮、非常引人注目的衣服，感觉有了社交媒体，你知道的，每个人都以如此快的速度向下滚动他们的 Instagram 屏幕，任何吸引眼球的东西，这似乎是的，就像一个话题，一些会得到一些关注的东西 —— 这些趋势目前越来越受欢迎 —— 而不是那种低调的羊绒毛衣那种时尚。 Rob(罗伯)So her reason is social media. In our fast-paced lives, we’re quickly scrolling through our social media feeds and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed.所以她的理由是社交媒体。在我们快节奏的生活中，我们快速浏览社交媒体信息，人们希望脱颖而出，吸引我们的注意力并引起注意。 Neil(尼尔)And these attention-seekers need to wear some eye-catching – something that will catch your eye and be noticed. High-vis clothing certainly does that!这些寻求关注的人需要穿一些引人注目的衣服 —— 一些会吸引你眼球并被注意到的东西。High-vis 服装当然可以做到这一点！ Rob(罗伯)Hannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point – something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media – even if it is to say ‘that guys looks ridiculous’! And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in and accepting these kinds of trends – the word she used was traction.Hannah 提到，穿着不同的衣服会成为一个话题 —— 你或我可能会在工作中或社交媒体上讨论的东西 —— 即使是说“那些家伙看起来很荒谬”！她还提到，人们对这类趋势越来越感兴趣并接受 —— 她使用的词是牵引力。 Neil(尼尔)Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick. Of course fashion comes at a price. While an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear is normally affordable, when they’re sold as a fashion item they can go for much higher prices, particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front.这里的牵引力意味着这种时尚趋势开始流行起来。当然，时尚是有代价的。虽然用于工作服的普通高可见度背心通常价格实惠，但当它们作为时尚单品出售时，它们的价格可能会高得多，特别是如果它们的正面有设计师品牌。 Rob(罗伯)This raises an important question. We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs, so does this fashion devalue what they’re doing?这就提出了一个重要的问题。我们知道，许多穿着高可见度夹克的人都在做重要的工作，那么这种时尚是否贬低了他们正在做的事情的价值呢？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, it’s something Hannah Marriott talked about. Let’s hear from her again. What word does she use to describe a difficult issue?是的，这是 Hannah Marriott 谈到的事情。让我们再次听到她的心声。她用什么词来形容一个难题？ Hannah Marriott, Fashion Editor, The Guardian(Hannah Marriott，《卫报》时尚编辑)Every time fashion borrows from workwear, there’re always some sort of thorny issues around it - particularly when you’re charging £2000 for something that is actually very similar to, you know, a uniform that somebody might be wearing who doesn’t actually make that much money, you know, there’s obviously some thorny class issues there.每次时尚借鉴工作服时，总会有一些棘手的问题 —— 尤其是当你收取 2000 英镑的价格买一件实际上非常相似的东西时，你知道，某人可能穿着的制服实际上赚不到那么多钱，你知道，那里显然存在一些棘手的阶级问题。 Neil(尼尔)So she used the word thorny to describe the issue of things worn at work becoming expensive fashion items. Thorny issues are subjects that are difficult deal with. Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class – so different groups of people in society in different economic positions – some can afford clothing for fashion, others can only afford clothing for work.所以她用 thorny 这个词来描述工作时穿的东西变成昂贵的时尚单品的问题。棘手的问题是难以处理的话题。在这里，她特别提到了阶级问题 —— 因此社会上处于不同经济地位的不同群体 —— 有些人买得起时尚服装，有些人只能买得起工作用的衣服。 Rob(罗伯)And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing, then the people who need to stand out for their own safety may not stand out as easily.另一个问题是，如果每个人都开始穿着高可见度的衣服，那么需要为了自身安全而脱颖而出的人可能不会那么容易脱颖而出。 Neil(尼尔)And we wouldn’t want to miss you when you’re out cycling on your bike, Rob. But would we miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers? Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory. Was it… a) the 1970s; b) the 1980s or c) the1990s?当您骑自行车外出时，我们不想错过您，罗伯。但是，如果您穿着一双护腿套，我们会想念您吗？早些时候，我问护腿套是哪十年的流行时尚配饰。是不是……a） 1970 年代；b） 1980 年代还是 c） 1990 年代？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, and I said b) the 1980s. It’s got to be right!是的，我说的是 b） 1980 年代。它必须是正确的！ Neil(尼尔)Well, you know your fashion, Rob – it was indeed the 1980s. Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, but in the early 1980s they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear.嗯，你知道你的时尚，罗伯 - 那确实是 1980 年代。暖腿套最初是舞者穿着的，以防止她们的肌肉在伸展后抽筋，但在 1980 年代初期，它们成为十几岁女孩穿的时尚。 Rob(罗伯)OK, let’s move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we’ve mentioned today. Starting with fashion victim – that’s someone who always wears what’s thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn’t actually look good on them. Like that pair of red jeans you used to wear, Neil.好，让我们继续回顾我们今天提到的一些词汇。从时尚受害者开始 —— 那是总是穿着被认为是时尚的衣服的人，即使它实际上穿在他们身上并不好看。就像你以前穿的那条红色牛仔裤一样，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)They, Rob, were on-trend – that means ‘in keeping up with the latest fashion’. Of course wearing something red is very eye-catching which means attracting attention and being noticed.他们，罗伯，紧跟潮流 —— 这意味着“跟上最新的时尚”。当然，穿红色衣服非常引人注目，这意味着吸引注意力并被注意到。 Rob(罗伯)Next we mentioned traction. If something gains traction it becomes accepted and popular. And then we had understated. In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention and is not that impressive.接下来我们提到了牵引力。如果某件事获得牵引力，它就会被接受和流行。然后我们就低估了。在时尚界，这描述了不引起注意且不那么令人印象深刻的事物。 Neil(尼尔)And then we discussed the word thorny. A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle and similarly a thorny issue is a subject that is difficult to deal with and discuss.然后我们讨论了 thorny 这个词。长有荆棘的树木或灌木丛很难触摸和处理，同样，棘手的问题也是一个难以处理和讨论的话题。 Rob(罗伯)Well, we’ve covered some thorny and less thorny issues today but we know that fashions change and maybe high-vis fashion won’t be here forever.好吧，我们今天已经讨论了一些棘手和不那么棘手的问题，但我们知道时尚会发生变化，也许高可见度的时尚不会永远存在。 Neil(尼尔)That’s it for now but please join us next time for 6 Minute English.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilRob, would you say that were a snowflake? RobWow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude? NeilSo I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked. RobDon’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say. NeilThere is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there? RobYes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults. NeilWell we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016. RobWell, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob? RobThanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be. NeilAlso, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do. RobThese terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics. NeilThe topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence? Evan DavisFirst, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination. NeilHe says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence. RobIf you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive. NeilDavis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again. Evan DavisWhere the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong. RobHis point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things. NeilAnd I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes. RobWell I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil? NeilOf course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016. RobAnd I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right! NeilWell, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence. RobPeople can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group. NeilThe term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings. RobTo call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification. NeilAnd finally we have taboo. Something that society says is offensive and shocking. So there we have it. What do you think Rob of this topic. RobWell it is a very difficult subject, particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society. Free speech is good but at times, particularly on social media, I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant. NeilWell, try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme. Do join us next time. Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. And of course, we have a new app which you can find on our website. It’s free and it’s brilliant isn’t it Rob? RobAbsolutely! NeilSee you soon, bye. RobBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil.你好。欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Neil。 Rob(罗伯)And I’m Rob.我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)Rob, would you say that were a snowflake?罗伯，你会说那是一片雪花吗？ Rob(罗伯)Wow, I can’t believe you said that, that’s so offensive. How could you be so rude?哇，我真不敢相信你这么说，这太冒犯了。你怎么能这么粗鲁呢？ Neil(尼尔)So I guess that’s a yes then? Sorry, I only asked.所以我想这是肯定的吗？对不起，我只是问了。 Rob(罗伯)Don’t worry, I wasn’t really upset, I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word. The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years. These days it’s used as an insult. It’s used to criticise people or groups that are seen to be very easily offended or upset by things that others say.别担心，我并不是真的不高兴，我只是想演示这个词的含义。近年来，雪花这个词有了新的含义。如今，它被用作侮辱。它被用来批评那些被认为很容易被别人所说的话冒犯或不安的人或团体。 Neil(尼尔)There is usually a political side to it too, isn’t there?它通常也有政治的一面，不是吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, people who use the word snowflake tend to be from the political right and they usually use it about those on the political left, particularly millennials - young, socially aware adults.是的，使用雪花这个词的人往往来自政治右翼，他们通常用它来指代政治左翼人士，尤其是千禧一代 —— 年轻的、有社会意识的成年人。 Neil(尼尔)Well we’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a quiz question. In which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.好吧，我们稍后将更详细地探讨这个主题，但首先是一个测验问题。snowflake 是哪一年的 Collins Dictionary 年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。 Rob(罗伯)Well, we said it’s quite a recent word so I’m going for c) 2016.嗯，我们说这是一个很新的词，所以我选择 c） 2016。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later on in the programme. The topic of offence is a very complicated one. First what do we mean by offence Rob?好吧，我们稍后会发现您在该计划中是否正确。冒犯的话题是一个非常复杂的话题。首先，我们所说的冒犯 罗伯 是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Thanks for that. That is a really difficult question. Something that is offensive is rude, insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset. What’s difficult about it though is that we don’t all find the same things offensive. Some people can be deliberately offensive and some people may be offensive without meaning to be.谢谢你。这是一个非常困难的问题。冒犯性的东西是粗鲁的、侮辱性的，会让人感到受伤和不安。然而，困难的是，我们并不都觉得同样的事情令人反感。有些人可能会故意冒犯，有些人可能会无意冒犯。 Neil(尼尔)Also, different people respond to offence in different ways - some accept it as the price of free speech and some try to stop the people they think are offensive from saying the things they do.此外，不同的人对冒犯的反应也不同 —— 有些人认为这是言论自由的代价，有些人试图阻止他们认为冒犯的人说出他们所做的事情。 Rob(罗伯)These terms come up quite a lot in discussions about equality, race, religion and of course, politics.这些术语在关于平等、种族、宗教，当然还有政治的讨论中经常出现。 Neil(尼尔)The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme Sweet Reason. Evan Davis presented the programme and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion. What does he say is the reason some people talk about offence?BBC 广播节目 Sweet Reason 详细讨论了这个话题。Evan Davis 介绍了该计划，以下是他对讨论的总结的第一部分。他说有些人谈论冒犯的原因是什么？ Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)First, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence when really they just have a political disagreement and on occasion groups that suffer discrimination or exclusion perhaps find it exhilarating or uniting to call out that discrimination.首先，有时人们可能确实会援引冒犯，而实际上他们只是存在政治分歧，有时遭受歧视或排斥的群体可能会觉得大声疾呼这种歧视令人振奋或团结起来。 Neil(尼尔)He says that some people take offence when it’s just a political disagreement. He says they invoke offence.他说，当这只是政治分歧时，有些人会感到冒犯。他说他们引发了冒犯。 Rob(罗伯)If you invoke something it means that you use it to support your point or explain your action. So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way because we are offended by what you have said, although the offence may only be a political difference rather than something truly offensive.如果你引用了某项内容，则意味着你用它来支持你的观点或解释你的操作。因此，援引冒犯就是说我们之所以这样做，是因为我们对你所说的话感到冒犯，尽管冒犯可能只是政治上的分歧，而不是真正冒犯性的东西。 Neil(尼尔)Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer from discrimination may get some feelings of unity when they call out discrimination. They feel more together when they publicise and highlight the discrimination they have experienced. Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine, that doesn’t mean people don’t have a right to be offended. Here’s Evan Davis again.戴维斯继续说，确实遭受歧视的群体在大声疾呼歧视时可能会获得一些团结的感觉。当他们宣传和强调他们所经历的歧视时，他们会感觉更加团结。即使受到的一些冒犯可能不是真实的，但这并不意味着人们没有权利被冒犯。埃文·戴维斯 又来了。 Evan Davis(埃文·戴维斯)Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this, societies are entitled to make certain things taboo and the millennials use of the word offensive is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong they are in a special category of wrong.所谓的雪花肯定有道理，社会有权将某些事情定为禁忌，而千禧一代使用冒犯性这个词只是为了说一些观点不仅是错误的，而且属于一类特殊的错误。 Rob(罗伯)His point here is that societies can decide that certain things are taboo. In this context something that is taboo is something that is regarded by society as being shocking and offensive and that it is OK for people to be offended by these things.他在这里的观点是，社会可以决定某些事情是禁忌。在这种情况下，禁忌的东西就是被社会视为令人震惊和冒犯的东西，人们被这些事情冒犯是可以的。 Neil(尼尔)And I think the point he makes is a good one. The word snowflake is usually used as an insult - but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake because it means they are standing up for a particular standard, they have a level of decency and social responsibility that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes.我认为他提出的观点很好。雪花这个词通常被用作侮辱 —— 但有些人可能会为自己是雪花而感到自豪，因为这意味着他们正在捍卫特定的标准，他们的体面和社会责任水平高于那些称他们为雪花的人。 Rob(罗伯)Well I hope we haven’t caused any offence today. Before we review the vocabulary, can we have the answer to today’s question Neil?好吧，我希望我们今天没有引起任何冒犯。在我们回顾词汇之前，我们能回答今天的问题吗 尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Of course, I asked in which year was snowflake one of Collins Dictionary’s words of the year? Was it… a) 1996; b) 2006 c) 2016.当然，我问雪花是哪一年的柯林斯词典年度词汇之一？是不是……a） 1996 年；b） 2006 c） 2016 年。 Rob(罗伯)And I said c) 2016. It’s got to be right!我说 c） 2016 年。它必须是正确的！ Neil(尼尔)Well, do you want to hear the story? Interestingly the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club, but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionary’s words of the year. Now let’s review our words of the day. First there is offence.那么，你想听这个故事吗？有趣的是，这个词是在 1996 年的《搏击俱乐部》一书中创造的，但直到 2016 年，它才成为词典的年度词汇之一。现在让我们回顾一下我们今天的词汇。首先是冒犯。 Rob(罗伯)People can take offence and be offended by something that is offensive. Something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking. It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.人们可能会因为冒犯性的事情而受到冒犯和冒犯。冒犯性的内容可能是粗鲁的、侮辱性的和令人震惊的。它可能表现为对个人或群体的羞辱或歧视。 Neil(尼尔)The term snowflake is a word used by some people to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily and unnecessarily. They don’t want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset. Then we had the word invoke. If you invoke something you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings.雪花一词是一些人用来谈论他们认为太容易和不必要地被冒犯的其他人的词。他们不想仅仅因为雪花不安就改变他们的语言或想法。然后我们有了 invoke 这个词。如果你援引某样东西，你就把它作为解释你的行为和感受的理由。 Rob(罗伯)To call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification.指出某件事就是挑战它，突出它并寻找理由。 Neil(尼尔)And finally we have taboo. Something that society says is offensive and shocking. So there we have it. What do you think Rob of this topic.最后，我们有禁忌。社会所说的令人反感和震惊的东西。所以我们有了它。你觉得这个话题的 罗伯 怎么样。 Rob(罗伯)Well it is a very difficult subject, particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society. Free speech is good but at times, particularly on social media, I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant.嗯，这是一个非常困难的话题，尤其是在政治、宗教和社会方面。言论自由是好的，但有时，尤其是在社交媒体上，我认为可能会带来不必要的不愉快。 Neil(尼尔)Well, try not to be offended but it is time for us to leave you for this programme.

And welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Dan. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. DanIn today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app? RobNo way, I would never use one. DanHmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right? RobAh, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left. DanWe will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think? RobWell, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is? Alice GrayIt’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person. RobSo she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not. DanAlthough of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them. RobYes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you. DanSo what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again. Alice GrayWe see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another. RobSo, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times. DanIn real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on. RobIn the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with. DanWell, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five. RobHmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right? DanSorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you? RobYes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high. DanIt’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary. RobOK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like. DanOur decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once. RobRejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them. DanIf you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection. RobYeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off. But, having many rejections can be difficult to cope with, which means it can be difficult to manage, difficult to keep positive. DanWell, we hope you don’t swipe left on this programme and you will join us again next time Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.

I’m Dan.你好。欢迎来到六分钟英语。我是 Dan。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob.大家好，我是 罗伯。 Dan(担)In today’s programme we’re going to be looking at what our brains are doing when we are using dating apps. Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app?在今天的节目中，我们将看看当我们使用约会应用节目时，我们的大脑在做什么。现在，罗伯，你用过约会应用吗？ Rob(罗伯)No way, I would never use one.不可能，我永远不会用。 Dan(担)Hmm, so Rob, can you explain, when talking about dating apps, what we mean by swipe left and swipe right?嗯，那么 罗伯，您能否解释一下，在谈论约会应用程序时，我们所说的向左滑动和向右滑动是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Ah, yes. These are not new words but technology has given them new meaning. To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you’re looking at. So imagine turning the page in a book, well, on a phone, you swipe. In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive. If you do like them, you swipe right. If you don’t like them, you swipe left.啊，是的。这些不是新词，但技术赋予了它们新的含义。滑动是您在智能手机上的手指移动以更改您正在查看的屏幕。所以想象一下，在书中翻页，嗯，在手机上，你滑动。在一些约会应用程序中，他们会向您展示您可能会觉得有吸引力的人的照片。如果你喜欢他们，你可以向右滑动。如果你不喜欢他们，你可以向左滑动。 Dan(担)We will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first, a question. In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five What do you think?我们稍后将深入探讨这个话题，但首先是一个问题。在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一 你怎么看？ Rob(罗伯)Well, all of those seem quite high to me, so I’m going to guess in the middle, one in four.嗯，所有这些在我看来都相当高，所以我猜一下，四分之一。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right later in the programme. Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger. Recently she was a guest on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour programme and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps compared to when we meet people in real life. What difference does she say there is?好吧，我们将在该计划的后面发现您是否正确。现在，Alice Gray 是一名科学传播者和博主。最近，她做客了 BBC Radio 4 的 Woman’s Hour 节目，她被问及当我们使用约会应用节目时，与在现实生活中认识人时相比，我们的大脑中发生了什么。她说有什么区别呢？ Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)It’s very easy to think that with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right, that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different, when actually it’s really similar to how we do it in person.我们很容易认为，通过这些瞬间向左滑动、向右滑动，我们大脑中如何挑选合适伴侣的过程会非常不同，而实际上这与我们亲自做事的方式非常相似。 Rob(罗伯)So she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar. Online we make decisions very quickly about who we like. These decisions are almost immediate - she used the adjective instantaneous for this. So we make these instantaneous decisions then choose to swipe left or swipe right. In real life, we do the same thing. We know almost immediately when we see someone if we find them attractive or not.所以她说，我们大脑中发生的事情实际上非常相似。在网上，我们很快就决定了我们喜欢谁。这些决定几乎是立竿见影的 —— 她为此使用了形容词 instantaneous。因此，我们立即做出这些决定，然后选择向左滑动或向右滑动。在现实生活中，我们做同样的事情。当我们看到某人时，我们几乎立即知道我们是否觉得他们有吸引力。 Dan(担)Although of course in digital dating, one you’ve swiped left you will never see that person again and you won’t have the chance to meet. In the real world you could meet someone you don’t find attractive instantaneously and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them.当然，在数字约会中，您向左滑动的约会将永远不会再看到那个人，您也没有机会见面。在现实世界中，您可能会立即遇到一个您认为没有吸引力的人，然后了解他们并发现您确实非常喜欢他们。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, that is true, but then possibly they won’t like you. And then you have to deal with rejection. Rejection is when someone doesn’t find you attractive and they don’t want to spend time with you or get to know you.是的，这是真的，但那样的话，他们可能不会喜欢你。然后你必须面对拒绝。拒绝是指有人觉得你没有吸引力，他们不想花时间和你在一起或了解你。 Dan(担)So what’s the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection? Here’s Alice Gray again.那么，在我们的大脑中，在线拒绝和现实生活中的拒绝有什么区别呢？又是 Alice Gray。 Alice Gray(爱丽丝·格雷)We see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on dating apps are similar, just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot higher than the ones in real life. So in real life you’ll have time to, sort of, compute the rejection, get over it a little bit, and dust yourself off and get on with it. Whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high it’s often hard to cope with one coming in after another.我们看到，与现实生活中的拒绝和约会应用程序上的拒绝相关的许多模式是相似的，只是你在约会应用程序上被拒绝的比率比现实生活中的要高得多。所以在现实生活中，你会有时间，在某种程度上，计算一下被拒绝的情况，稍微克服它，然后掸掉身上的灰尘，继续前进。虽然约会应用程序的拒绝率如此之高，但通常很难应对一个接一个的进来。 Rob(罗伯)So, she says that our brain’s response to real life and online rejection is quite similar, but in the digital world you can be rejected many more times.所以，她说我们的大脑对现实生活和在线拒绝的反应非常相似，但在数字世界中，你可能会被拒绝很多次。 Dan(担)In real life you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection, to get over it, as she says. You can dust yourself off which is a way of saying you think positively to make yourself feel better - imagine falling over on the ground, when you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt, you need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again, before you carry on.正如她所说，在现实生活中，你有更多的时间从拒绝中恢复过来，克服它。你可以把自己掸掉，这是一种说你积极思考让自己感觉更好的方式 —— 想象一下摔倒在地上，当你站起来时，你可能会沾满灰尘和污垢，你需要把自己掸掉灰尘，让自己再次做好准备，然后再继续。 Rob(罗伯)In the online world though, you don’t have that time. Online dating apps can lead to many rejections and psychologically that can be difficult to manage. Another way of saying ‘difficult to manage’ is difficult to cope with.然而，在网络世界中，你没有那个时间。在线约会应用程序可能会导致许多拒绝，并且在心理上可能难以管理。“难以管理”的另一种说法是难以应对。 Dan(担)Well, we don’t want you to reject us, so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question before a recap of today’s vocabulary. I asked: in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online? Is it: a) One in three; b) One in four c) One in five.好吧，我们不希望您拒绝我们，所以现在是时候在回顾今天的词汇之前为您提供该测验问题的答案了。我问：在英国，大约有多少婚姻是从这对夫妇在网上见面开始的？是：a） 三分之一；b） 四分之一 c） 五分之一。 Rob(罗伯)Hmmm, so I said b) one in four – 25%. Was I right?嗯，所以我说 b） 四分之一 – 25%。我是对的吗？ Dan(担)Sorry, Rob, the answer is a), one in three. Does that surprise you?对不起，罗伯，答案是 a），三分之一。这让你感到惊讶吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, it does, I didn’t think it would be that high.是的，确实如此，我没想到会那么高。 Dan(担)It’s the sign of the times, Rob. Digital world – digital dating! Let’s have a look at that vocabulary.这是时代的标志，罗伯。数字世界 – 数字约会！让我们来看看这个词汇。 Rob(罗伯)OK, well, we started with the verb to swipe. The movement of our finger on smartphone or tablet screen to indicate whether we like someone or not. Swipe right for like, swipe left if you don’t like.好了，我们从动词 to swipe 开始。我们的手指在智能手机或平板电脑屏幕上的移动，以表明我们是否喜欢某人。向右滑动表示喜欢，不喜欢则向左滑动。 Dan(担)Our decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not are often instantaneous. This adjective means immediate, at once.我们决定是否发现某人有吸引力通常是即时的。这个形容词的意思是立即的。 Rob(罗伯)Rejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them, you don’t want to be romantically involved with them.拒绝是指你让某人知道你对他们不感兴趣，你不想和他们发生浪漫关系。 Dan(担)If you are rejected you might need some time to feel better, and for this you can use the phrasal verb get over. It can take some time to get over a rejection.如果你被拒绝了，你可能需要一些时间来感觉好些，为此你可以使用短语动词 get over。克服拒绝可能需要一些时间。 Rob(罗伯)Yeah, I know! Being positive and optimistic after a rejection can be described as dusting yourself off. But, having many rejections can be difficult to cope with, which means it can be difficult to manage, difficult to keep positive.是的，我明白！被拒绝后保持积极乐观可以被描述为掸掉自己的灰尘。但是，有很多拒绝可能很难应对，这意味着很难管理，很难保持积极。 Dan(担)Well, we hope you don’t swipe left on this programme and you will join us again next time Remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.好吧，我们希望您不要在这个节目上向左滑动，下次您会再次加入我们请记住，您可以在 Instagram、Facebook、Twitter、YouTube 上找到我们，当然还有我们的网站 bbclearningenglish.com。 Rob(罗伯)And don’t forget our new BBC Learning English app.别忘了我们新的 BBC Learning English 应用程序。 Dan(担)Oh good idea.

I’m Catherine. DanAnd I’m Dan. CatherineNow Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all? DanIf I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that’s not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I’ll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life. CatherineNice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think? DanBased on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself. CatherineWe’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest. DanDeath by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years. CatherineHow has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems? John LaurensonIf you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close. CatherineHow did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan? DanWell, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’. Catherine‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said? DanHe talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk. CatherineLaurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard. DanStern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around. CatherineSo we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life. DanBut he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise. CatherineWell, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? DanAnd I said I had no idea. CatherineWell, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours. DanI guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain. CatherineAnd sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise. DanAnd if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live. CatherineNext we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise. DanSomething that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously. CatherineIf you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict. DanAnd finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around. CatherineWell, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise.

I’m Catherine.您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan.我是 Dan。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?现在 Dan，你会说你有久坐不动的生活方式吗？ Dan(担)If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life. I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day. But because I know that’s not good for my health, I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week and I’ll do some exercise, like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend. So, my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.如果我只去工作，是的，我会过上久坐不动的生活。我坐在管子上，一天中的大部分时间都坐在我的办公桌前或工作室里。但因为我知道这对我的健康不利，所以我也喜欢每周去几次健身房，我会做一些运动，比如骑自行车或在周末踢足球。所以，我的工作是久坐不动的，但不是我的生活。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Nice answer, Dan. And our topic today is about how one country in particular has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population. But before we find out more, here is today’s question. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours? So, Dan, what do you think?“回答得不错，丹。我们今天的主题是关于一个国家如何在处理久坐不动的人口问题方面非常成功。但在我们了解更多信息之前，这里有一个今天的问题。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？那么，Dan，你怎么看？ Dan(担)Based on my day, it would be between 8 and 9 hours, but I don’t know if I am an average person! So I’m interested to learn the answer for myself.根据我的一天，这将在 8 到 9 小时之间，但我不知道我是否是一个普通人！所以我很想自己了解答案。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Now, 40 years ago Finland was perhaps the unhealthiest country in the Western world. But now, it’s one of the healthiest.我们稍后会在节目中找到答案。现在，40 年前，芬兰可能是西方世界最不健康的国家。但现在，它是最健康的疫苗之一。 Dan(担)Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80% and life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until, has risen by 10 years.芬兰的心脏病死亡率下降了 80%，预期寿命延长了 10 年。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)How has this been achieved? This was investigated on BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement. BBC reporter John Laurenson describes in a humorous way how this works. How does he describe someone with many health problems?这是如何实现的？BBC Radio 4 的 You and Yours 节目对此进行了调查，芬兰改善国家健康的方式之一是通过大量的国家参与。BBC 记者约翰·劳伦森 以幽默的方式描述了这是如何运作的。他如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人？ John Laurenson(约翰·劳伦森)If you’re an exercise shirker because you’re fat or old or asthmatic or chained to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps, of a stern lady with a clipboard and make some firm suggestions. They won’t actually drag you off your PlayStation, out of your nursing home or out of the pub but they do get quite close.如果你因为肥胖、年老、哮喘、被锁在电脑前、或者只是懒惰或所有这些事情都归入一个超级健康重灾区而成为运动推卸者，他们可能会以一位拿着写字板的严厉女士的形式来找你，并提出一些坚定的建议。他们实际上不会把你从 PlayStation 上拖下来，拖出你的疗养院或酒吧，但他们确实非常接近。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?丹，他是如何描述一个有很多健康问题的人的？ Dan(担)Well, he wasn’t very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite tongue-in-cheek, which means that it’s meant to be funny and shouldn’t be taken seriously but he called the people with many health problems ‘super-health disaster zones’.嗯，他不是很恭维，我们应该强调，这份报告相当半开玩笑，这意味着它本来就是为了搞笑，不应该被认真对待，但他称有很多健康问题的人为“超级健康灾难区”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)‘Super-health disaster zones’. So what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?“超级健康灾区”。那么，我们还可以从他所说的内容中挑选出哪些其他词汇呢？ Dan(担)He talked about being an exercise shirker. A shirker is someone who avoids doing something usually because they are being lazy. It’s also a verb, to shirk.他谈到自己是一个运动推销者。推卸责任的人通常是因为他们懒惰而避免做某事。它也是一个动词，即 shrk。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Laurenson says that if you are an exercise shirker or indeed a super-health disaster zone, someone from the authorities will come and visit you. In another tongue-in-cheek description he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a clipboard.劳伦森说，如果你是一个运动推销者，或者确实是一个超级健康重灾区，当局会有人来拜访你。在另一个半开玩笑的描述中，他说这位访客可能是一位拿着写字板的严厉女士。 Dan(担)Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict, someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry. And in his description the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard. It’s a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you are moving around.Stern 是一个形容词，意思是非常严肃和严格，一个没有幽默感的人可能会很生气。在他的描述中，记者说这位严厉的女士将有一个剪贴板。这是一块硬板，您可以在上面贴上纸张，这样您就可以在四处走动时在纸上写字。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health habits and make you live a healthier life.所以我们有一张生气的女士来到你家的照片，告诉你的健康习惯，让你过上更健康的生活。 Dan(担)But he does point out that they won’t actually drag you out of your house to do exercise. However, in the report he goes on to say that there is lot of encouragement, even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.但他确实指出，他们实际上不会把你拖出家门去锻炼。然而，在报告中，他继续说，即使从学生时代开始，也有很多鼓励要吃得好并定期锻炼。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time, let’s get the answer to today’s quiz. According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down every day? Is it: a) between 6 and 7 hours; b) between 7 and 8 hours or c) between 8 and 9 hours?好吧，在一位拿着写字板的严厉女士来告诉我们没有按时完成之前，让我们来了解今天测验的答案。根据最近的一项调查，英国人平均每天坐下多长时间？是：a） 6 到 7 小时之间；b） 7 到 8 小时之间或 c） 8 到 9 小时之间？ Dan(担)And I said I had no idea.我说我不知道。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, the answer was c), Dan - between 8 and 9 hours. In fact, it was 8 and a quarter hours. By comparison, in Finland, it’s less than 6 hours.嗯，答案是 c）， Dan - 8 到 9 小时之间。事实上，那是 8 个半小时。相比之下，芬兰的车程不到 6 小时。 Dan(担)I guess we are a lot more sedentary in Britain.我想我们在英国久坐不动的情况要多得多。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And sedentary is our first word in our vocabulary review. It’s an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.久坐是我们词汇复习中的第一个词。这是一个形容词，用于描述一种涉及大量坐着而不进行太多运动的生活方式。 Dan(担)And if you are very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy. Life expectancy, the age to which you are expected to live.如果你久坐不动，可能会导致预期寿命降低。预期寿命，您预计的寿命。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Next we had the word shirker for someone who avoids doing something they don’t like, usually because they are lazy. For example, an exercise shirker avoids exercise.接下来，我们有 shirker 这个词，指的是那些避免做他们不喜欢的事情的人，通常是因为他们很懒惰。例如，运动的 shirker 避免运动。 Dan(担)Something that is said tongue-in-cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.半开玩笑地说的话是为了幽默而不是被认真对待。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)If you are stern though, you want to be taken seriously. It’s an adjective that means serious and strict.不过，如果你很严厉，你就会希望被认真对待。这是一个形容词，意思是严肃和严格。 Dan(担)And finally there’s clipboard. A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.最后是剪贴板。一块你把文件贴在上面的板子，这样你就可以在走动时在上面写字。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, Dan, it’s time for us to go and get some exercise. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Neil. RobAnd I’m Rob. NeilNow Rob, you like your food, don’t you? RobOh yes, yum yum, food! One of my favourite things. NeilAnd what do you think of street food? RobI love street food. There are some great places in London where you can find delicious foods from all over the world, cooked in front of you in market stalls on the street. NeilIt’s quite new though, isn’t it - not really a British tradition. RobI guess not, but it seems to be much more popular these days. NeilWell our topic today is street food, but before we tuck into that, here is today’s question. Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old? What do you think? RobI don’t know - but what I do know is, I wouldn’t really want to try a sandwich made from that bread! NeilMmm, it might be a bit mouldy. RobYes! Anyway, I’m going to have a guess and say c) 5,500 years old. NeilRight, we will find out the answer later in the programme. Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas? Mark LaurieIt’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like. NeilSo where does he say the popularity of street food is growing? RobHe says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities. NeilSo essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere. RobExactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big. NeilYes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular. RobYou know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience. NeilWell, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK. Mark LaurieIt’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like. NeilMark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular. What kind of food does he say it’s not like? Mark LaurieYeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub. NeilSo street food is many things, but what isn’t it? RobWell he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven. NeilYou know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave. RobBut I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic. NeilYes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture. RobHe also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’. NeilWell, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years? RobMmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years. NeilAnd I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years. RobVery tasty I’m sure. NeilYes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary. RobThen we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular. NeilAnd not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities. RobSomething which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time. NeilAnd one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy. RobAnd finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven. And that kind of food is not seen by some as authentic. NeilWell, it’s time to eat, so that’s all we have time for today.

Recently archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe is the oldest remains of bread. How old is this bread? Is it… a) 18,000 years old; b) 14,000 years old, or c) 5,500 years old?

Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterers Association. He is an expert in the business of street food in the UK. He appeared on BBC radio’s The Food Programme and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years. In his answer he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food. What are those areas?好的，我们将在稍后的节目中找到答案。Mark Laurie 来自全国餐饮业协会。他是英国街头食品业务的专家。他出现在 BBC 电台的 The Food Programme 上，并被问及近年来街头食品业务发生了怎样的变化。在他的回答中，他谈到了街头食品增长最快的地区。这些区域是什么？ Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream. Part of the cultural fabric of the country really, or it’s beginning to be, certainly in the bigger cities and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.街头食品的增长非常惊人，它真的起飞了，它真的成为了相当主流。这个国家文化结构的一部分，真的，或者说它开始成为，肯定是在大城市，而且如果你愿意的话，越来越多地出现在那种省份。 Neil(尼尔)So where does he say the popularity of street food is growing?那么，他认为街头食品的受欢迎程度在哪里增长呢？ Rob(罗伯)He says that it’s in the bigger cities and also in the provinces. The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities.他说，在大城市和外省都有。省是一个词，意思是城市以外的国家部分。 Neil(尼尔)So essentially, he’s saying it’s getting more popular everywhere.所以从本质上讲，他是在说它在任何地方都越来越受欢迎。 Rob(罗伯)Exactly. In fact he says the growth is phenomenal. This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big.完全。事实上，他说增长是惊人的。这意味着他认为增长非常壮观，非常大。 Neil(尼尔)Yes he says that it’s really taken off. Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways. In this sense, when something takes off it means it becomes successful and popular.是的，他说它真的起飞了。Taken off 是可以以多种不同方式使用的短语动词之一。从这个意义上说，当某件事起飞时，意味着它变得成功和受欢迎。 Rob(罗伯)You know, street food isn’t really something you associate with Britain. Perhaps it’s the climate or British food - so street food is something that we are now getting used to and enjoying more. In fact Mark says that it’s now becoming mainstream. This means that is no longer something that it’s seen as being unusual or different. It’s becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience.你知道，街头小吃并不是你真正与英国联系在一起的东西。也许是气候或英国食物 - 所以街头小吃是我们现在已经习惯并更加享受的东西。事实上，Mark 说它现在正在成为主流。这意味着它不再被视为不寻常或不同的东西。它正在成为日常饮食体验中被接受的一部分。 Neil(尼尔)Well, let’s listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK.好吧，让我们再听听 Mark Laurie 谈论英国街头食品的增长。 Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)It’s been phenomenal the growth in street food, it’s really taken off, it’s really become quite mainstream.

What kind of food does he say it’s not like?Mark Laurie 继续谈论街头食品变得流行的原因。他说这不像什么样的食物？ Mark Laurie(马克·劳里)Yeah, it’s just really captured the imagination of the public. It’s honest food, it’s authentic food and it’s people that you can trust making it. It’s not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub.是的，它真的抓住了公众的想象力。这是诚实的食物，是正宗的食物，而且是您可以信任的人制作。它不是一些微波炉食物或任何你在当地酒吧可能买到的东西。 Neil(尼尔)So street food is many things, but what isn’t it?所以街头小吃有很多东西，但什么不是呢？ Rob(罗伯)Well he says that it’s not like food you might get in some pubs. That food, he says, may be some microwave food. Which is food prepared in a microwave oven.嗯，他说这不像你在一些酒吧里买到的食物。他说，那种食物可能是一些微波炉食物。这是在微波炉中准备的食物。 Neil(尼尔)You know I quite like a microwave meal now and then and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave.你知道我很喜欢时不时地用微波炉加热我的剩菜。 Rob(罗伯)But I guess if you were paying for a nice meal you wouldn’t expect reheated leftovers! I think the point he is making is that in many places the food you are served is not freshly made. It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave. Street food, he says, is authentic.但我想，如果你花钱吃一顿美餐，你就不会指望重新加热的剩菜了！我认为他想说的是，在许多地方，你吃到的食物不是新鲜制作的。它可以预先准备好并在微波炉中完成。他说，街头小吃是正宗的。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, authentic. It’s real, fresh and cooked right in front of you and if it’s food from a particular country it’s probably being prepared by people from that culture.是的，正宗的。它是真实的、新鲜的，就在你面前烹制的，如果它是来自特定国家的食物，它可能是由来自该文化的人准备的。 Rob(罗伯)He also says that this has captured the imagination of the public. It’s something that the public have experienced and thought - ‘Yep, you know, I like this, this is a great idea.’.他还表示，这激发了公众的想象力。这是公众经历过并认为的事情 - ‘是的，你知道，我喜欢这个，这是一个好主意。 Neil(尼尔)Well, all this talk of food is making me hungry, so let’s get the answer to the quiz and review today’s vocabulary before we head off and grab a bite to eat. We asked about the age of bread discovered by archaeologists in Jordan. Was it a) 18,000 years old, b) 14,000 years or c) 5,500 years?好吧，所有这些关于食物的讨论都让我感到饥饿，所以让我们得到测验的答案，并在我们出发吃点东西之前复习今天的词汇。我们询问了约旦考古学家发现的面包的年代。是 a） 18,000 年，b） 14,000 年还是 c） 5,500 年？ Rob(罗伯)Mmm, and I said it was c) 5,500 years.嗯，我说是 c） 5,500 年。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m afraid it’s a lot mouldier than that. The answer was 14,000 years.而且我担心它比这要霉得多。答案是 14,000 年。 Rob(罗伯)Very tasty I’m sure.我敢肯定，非常好吃。 Neil(尼尔)Yes! Right then, the vocabulary. We started off with the adjective phenomenal to describe something that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary.是的！就在那时，词汇。我们从形容词 phenomenal 开始来描述令人惊叹、非凡和非凡的事情。 Rob(罗伯)Then we had to take off, a phrasal verb which means to become popular. Street food has really taken off in the UK: it’s become really popular.然后我们不得不起飞，一个短语动词，意思是变得流行。街头小吃在英国真正起飞：它变得非常受欢迎。 Neil(尼尔)And not just in the cities but also in the provinces, which is a noun to describe areas of a country that aren’t the major cities.不仅在城市，而且在省份，这是一个名词，用来描述一个国家不是主要城市的地区。 Rob(罗伯)Something which captures the imagination is something which makes you interested and not just for a short time.吸引想象力的东西是让你感兴趣的东西，而不仅仅是短暂的。 Neil(尼尔)And one thing which has captured the imagination of the British public is authentic street food. Something authentic is real, it’s genuine, it’s not a fake or a copy.吸引英国公众想象力的一件事是正宗的街头食品。真实的东西就是真的，它是真实的，不是假的或复制的。 Rob(罗伯)And finally we had microwave food, food prepared in a microwave oven.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Hello! NeilNow, Catherine, say cheese. CatherineCheeeese. NeilThank you, a little souvenir of our time together. CatherineLet’s have a look… Hang on a minute. You just took a selfie, I wasn’t even in the picture. NeilAh, well, that’s the magic of the smartphone, two cameras! You know, that’s not something you can do with a traditional camera. I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days? CatherineI do actually. It’s in a cupboard somewhere at home. NeilWell, that is the topic of this programme. Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones, or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone? CatherineInteresting question. But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners? NeilOf course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think? CatherineWell, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself. NeilOK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens. CatherineThat’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control. NeilAnd there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs. CatherineAnd of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated. NeilPhil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion? Phil HallI don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely. NeilSo does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera? CatherineIn a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales. NeilThis is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else. CatherineFor people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone. NeilSo camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again. Phil HallI think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit. NeilWho does he say might be buying cameras? CatherineHe says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones. NeilGetting into something means becoming very interested in it. CatherineAnd if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it. NeilSo people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’. CatherineNow, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level. NeilNow, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again. CatherineFirst we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice. NeilWhen the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time. CatherineTo opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it. NeilIf you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated. CatherineAnd developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up. NeilRight, that’s all from us from us in this programme. Do join us again next time and don’t forget that in the meantime you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye. CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And I’m Catherine. Hello!我是 Catherine。你好！ Neil(尼尔)Now, Catherine, say cheese.现在，凯瑟琳，说奶酪。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Cheeeese.Cheeeese 的。 Neil(尼尔)Thank you, a little souvenir of our time together.谢谢你，我们在一起的时光的小纪念品。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Let’s have a look… Hang on a minute. You just took a selfie, I wasn’t even in the picture.让我们来看看……等一下。你只是拍了一张自拍，我甚至不在照片里。 Neil(尼尔)Ah, well, that’s the magic of the smartphone, two cameras! You know, that’s not something you can do with a traditional camera. I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days?啊，嗯，这就是智能手机的魔力，两个摄像头！你知道，这不是传统相机可以做到的。我的意思是，你现在有单独的相机吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I do actually. It’s in a cupboard somewhere at home.我实际上是这样做的。它在家里某个地方的橱柜里。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that is the topic of this programme. Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones, or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone?嗯，这就是这个节目的主题。传统相机是否已完全被智能手机取代，或者换句话说，智能手机是否已经过时了？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Interesting question. But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners?有趣的问题。但在我们进入这个话题之前，我们先向听众提出一个问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)Of course. We are certainly in the digital age of photography but when was the first digital camera phone released? Was it: a) 2000; b) 2004 or c) 2007? What do you think?答案是肯定的。我们当然处于摄影的数字时代，但第一款数码照相手机是什么时候发布的呢？是：a） 2000 年；b） 2004 年还是 c） 2007 年？你觉得怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Well, I actually know this one, so I’m going to be fair and keep it to myself.嗯，我其实知道这个，所以我要公平地说，把它留给自己。 Neil(尼尔)OK, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme. There are different kinds of cameras available today. There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic and usually come with a fixed lens.好，好吧，请听节目结束时的答案。今天有不同种类的相机可用。有紧凑型相机，它们很小，大部分是自动的，通常带有固定镜头。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs which are bigger, and you can change the lenses on these cameras and they allow for a lot of manual control.没错。然后是更大的 SLR 和 DSLR，您可以更换这些相机的镜头，它们允许进行大量手动控制。 Neil(尼尔)And there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs. They are small like a compact camera but you can also use the same lenses on them that you can use on DSLRs.还有无反光镜相机，它是紧凑型相机和数码单反相机的交叉。它们像紧凑型相机一样小，但您也可以在它们上使用与数码单反相机相同的镜头。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And of course, there are the cameras on smartphones, and these are convenient and they’re becoming increasingly sophisticated.当然，智能手机上也有摄像头，这些摄像头很方便，而且它们变得越来越复杂。 Neil(尼尔)Phil Hall is the editor of Tech Radar magazine. He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete. What is his opinion?Phil Hall 是 Tech Radar 杂志的编辑。在 BBC 节目 You and Yours 中，有人问他是否认为智能手机会让其他相机过时。他怎么看呢？ Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)I don’t think so. I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it’s the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market’s changing. And I don’t think there’ll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely.我不这么认为。我认为，虽然紧凑型相机的销量确实有所下降，但人们选择了智能手机，而低端、廉价的紧凑型相机则选择了智能手机，我认为制造商正在关注更高端的高端相机、高端紧凑型相机、数码单反相机，这些相机是可以安装镜头的相机，无反光镜相机。所以，市场正在发生变化。而且我认为不会很快出现……智能手机将完全接管相机。 Neil(尼尔)So does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera?那么 Phil 认为智能手机会杀死相机吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)In a word, no. He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff. This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales.一句话，没有。他确实说过，廉价紧凑型相机的销量已经急剧下降。这个相当戏剧性的表达描述了销售额的大幅下降。 Neil(尼尔)This is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera are now opting for the camera on their smartphone. When you opt for something you choose it rather than something else.这是因为选择紧凑型相机的那种消费者现在正在选择智能手机上的相机。当你选择某样东西时，你自己选择了它，而不是其他东西。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)For people who want a quick, easy to use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos, compact cameras used to be the best choice – but now it’s the smartphone.对于想要以快速、易于使用和方便的方式拍摄质量合理的照片的人来说，紧凑型相机曾经是最佳选择 —— 但现在它是智能手机。 Neil(尼尔)So camera makers are now moving to the more high-end market, the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. So who is still buying these more expensive cameras? Here’s Phil Hall again.因此，相机制造商现在正在转向更高端的市场，即 DSLR 和无反光镜相机。那么谁还在购买这些更昂贵的相机呢？又是 Phil Hall。 Phil Hall(菲尔·霍尔)I think it’s… some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone and sort of getting into photography that way and that’s a really great first step into photography and I think people are probably, sometimes, getting a bit frustrated with the quality once they sort of start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what’s the next rung up so it’s people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit.我认为这是……其中一些人拿起智能手机，以这种方式进入摄影领域，这是进入摄影界的非常好的第一步，我认为人们有时可能会对质量感到有点沮丧，一旦他们开始提高自己的创意技能，然后看看下一步会发生什么，所以人们想要拓宽他们的创意技能。 Neil(尼尔)Who does he say might be buying cameras?他说谁可能会购买相机？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)He says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of smartphones.他说，从事摄影的人可能会对智能手机的质量感到沮丧。 Neil(尼尔)Getting into something means becoming very interested in it.进入某样东西意味着对它非常感兴趣。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And if you are frustrated with something it means you are disappointed with it. You are not happy with it.如果你对某件事感到沮丧，那就意味着你对它感到失望。你对它不满意。 Neil(尼尔)So people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations and want to be more creative are going to the next level. They are moving up, they are, as Phil said taking ‘the next rung up’.因此，那些使用智能手机开始摄影但对其局限性感到沮丧并希望更具创意的人将更上一层楼。他们正在上升，正如 Phil 所说，他们正在迈出“下一个梯级”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now, a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder, so the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level.现在，梯级是梯子的水平台阶，所以 takes the next rung up 这句话是描述在更高层次上做某事的一种方式。 Neil(尼尔)Now, talking of higher levels, did you get this week’s quiz question right? The question was: When was the first phone with a digital camera released? Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007? The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000. Now, to take us up to the end of the programme, let’s look at the vocabulary again.现在，说到更高级别，你对本周的测验问题理解正确吗？问题是：第一款带有数码相机的手机是什么时候发布的？是 2000 年、2004 年还是 2007 年？第一款带有数码相机的手机于 2000 年发布。现在，为了带我们进入节目的结尾，让我们再次看一下词汇。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)First we had the adjective obsolete which describes something that has been replaced and is no longer the first choice.首先，我们有形容词 obsolete，它描述了已被替换且不再是首选的事物。 Neil(尼尔)When the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers, it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time.例如，当 drop off a cliff 一词用于销售数字时，表示销售额在短时间内大幅下降。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)To opt for something means to choose something and when you become very interested in an activity you can say that you get into it.To choose for something 意味着选择某事，当你对一项活动非常感兴趣时，你可以说你进入了它。 Neil(尼尔)If you are trying to do something and you can’t do it because you don’t have the skill or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated.如果你正在尝试做某事但因为你没有技能或你使用的设备不正确或不够好而无法做到，你可能会感到沮丧。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up.将您的技能发展到更高的水平可以被描述为更上一层楼。 Neil(尼尔)Right, that’s all from us from us in this programme.

NeilAnd I’m Neil. CatherineNow, Neil, you’re a dad, aren’t you? NeilI am a dad. How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes? CatherineI thought that was just your age. NeilWell, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think? CatherineI think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer? Dr Anna MachinThere’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was. NeilHow many reasons does she mention? CatherineShe mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next. NeilAnother reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it. CatherineYes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true. NeilThere was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again. Dr Anna MachinThere’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was. NeilSo what is it about some father’s own dads that they didn’t like? Here’s Dr Machin again. Dr Anna MachinWell, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are. NeilShe talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children. CatherineYes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong. NeilThese days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners. CatherineAnd talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question. NeilYes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%? CatherineAnd I said a very optimistic 95%. NeilBeing optimistic is good obviously because you are correct. CatherineThat’s fantastic! NeilAnd now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary… CatherineWe started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit. NeilWhich one? CatherineThe one that you left on the desk. NeilThat’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor. CatherineWhat? Yuck! NeilYeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something. CatherineThen we had to go along with something. This is when you agree to do something even if you are not keen on it. NeilAn absent father is one who is not at home to spend time with his children. CatherineAnd some fathers are disciplinarians. They have strict rules and they give out punishments but these days more fathers are hands-on which means they are ‘very much involved’ in looking after and bringing up their children. NeilWell, that’s all we have time for today. Join us again next time and remember you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course our website bbclearningenglish.com. See you soon. Goodbye! CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I’m Catherine.您好，欢迎来到六分钟 English，我是 Catherine。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil.我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Now, Neil, you’re a dad, aren’t you?现在，尼尔，你已经当爸爸了，不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)I am a dad. How did you know? Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes?我当爸爸了。你怎么知道的？是我胡须上的白发吗？是眼睛周围的皱纹吗？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I thought that was just your age.我以为那只是你的年龄。 Neil(尼尔)Well, yes, maybe. In today’s programme we’re going to be talking about fathers and how being a father has changed over the years. But before we hear more about this topic, our question for the day. According to recent research in the UK, what percentage of men are present when their children are born? Is it… a) 55%; b) 75% c) 95% What do you think?嗯，是的，也许吧。在今天的节目中，我们将讨论父亲以及这些年来成为父亲的变化。但在我们听到更多关于这个话题的信息之前，我们今天的问题。根据英国最近的研究，当孩子出生时，男性在场的百分比是多少？是吗。。。a） 55%；b） 75% c） 95% 你怎么看？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)I think a lot of men these days like to see their children born. It’s not culturally inappropriate so I’m going to go for 95%.我认为现在很多男人都喜欢看到他们的孩子出生。这在文化上并不合适，所以我会追求 95%。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, Dr Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist. She studies, among other things, how human behaviour has changed and is changing. She’s written a book called The Life of Dad. She’s been studying new fathers and spoke about her research on the BBC’s Woman’s Hour programme. She asked why men want to become fathers. She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons but how many does she mention in her answer?好吧，我们会在节目结束时了解您是否正确。现在，Anna Machin 博士是一位进化人类学家。她研究人类行为如何变化以及正在发生变化。她写了一本书，叫《爸爸的生活》。她一直在研究新爸爸，并在 BBC 的 Woman’s Hour 节目中谈到了她的研究。她问为什么男人想成为父亲。她首先说有很多原因，但她在回答中提到了多少？ Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.男人想当爸爸的原因有很多……对他们中的一些人来说，这只是他们已经到达的人生阶段。他们有房子，有工作，现在是组建家庭的时候了。有时他们承认实际上他们并不那么热衷，但他们的伴侣想要一个孩子，所以他们有点同意。有相当多的人实际上说他们这样做是因为他们想撤销父亲对他们所做的一切，所以改写与父亲和父亲经历有关的历史，成为比他们父亲更好的父亲。 Neil(尼尔)How many reasons does she mention?她提到了多少个原因？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)She mentioned three reasons. The first was that it was that time in life – the guys had a home and a job and having children was the thing to do next.她提到了三个原因。首先是那是人生中的那个时期 —— 伙计们有家和工作，生孩子是接下来要做的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Another reason was that it was what their partners wanted, even if they weren’t that keen themselves. If you’re not keen on something it means you are ‘not enthusiastic about it’, it’s not really something you want to do, but because it’s what their partner wants they agree to it, or as Dr Machin said, they’re going along with it.另一个原因是这是他们的合作伙伴想要的，即使他们自己并不那么热衷。如果你对某件事不热衷，那就意味着你 “对它不热衷”，这不是你真正想做的事情，但因为这是他们的伴侣想要的，所以他们同意了，或者正如 Machin 博士所说，他们同意了。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes, going along with something, is a phrase that means ‘agreeing to do’ something even though you don’t really want to do it. It’s interesting that Dr Machin said that some men admit to this. To admit to something is to say or agree that something is true even if you’re perhaps ashamed of it or you don’t want it to be true.是的，顺从某事是一个短语，意思是“同意做”某事，即使你并不是真的想做。有趣的是，Machin 博士说，一些男性承认这一点。承认某事就是说或同意某件事是真的，即使你可能为此感到羞耻或你不希望它是真的。 Neil(尼尔)There was one more reason she mentioned and that was that some men become parents because they want to be a better father than their own father had been. Let’s listen again.她还提到了一个原因，那就是一些男人成为父母是因为他们想成为一个比自己的父亲更好的父亲。让我们再听一遍。 Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)There’s lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers … for some of them it’s just a stage in life they’ve reached. They’ve got the house, they’ve got the job, now it’s time to have a family. Sometimes they admit that actually they’re not that keen, but their partner wants a baby, so they’re kinda going along with it. And a reasonable number actually say they do it because they want to undo what their father did to them, so rewrite history in relation to fathers and the experience of fathering, to be a better father than their father was.男人想当爸爸的原因有很多……对他们中的一些人来说，这只是他们已经到达的人生阶段。他们有房子，有工作，现在是组建家庭的时候了。有时他们承认实际上他们并不那么热衷，但他们的伴侣想要一个孩子，所以他们有点同意。有相当多的人实际上说他们这样做是因为他们想撤销父亲对他们所做的一切，所以改写与父亲和父亲经历有关的历史，成为比他们父亲更好的父亲。 Neil(尼尔)So what is it about some father’s own dads that they didn’t like? Here’s Dr Machin again.那么，他们不喜欢一些父亲自己的爸爸的什么呢？又是 Machin 博士。 Dr Anna Machin(Anna Machin 博士)Well, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful, some fathers were absent and others they just felt they were a very, I suppose, we’d say a 1950s father so distant, disciplinarian not actually involved in their children’s daily life and certainly not involved in their care. So today’s generation fathers, even in the 10 years that I’ve been studying dads we’ve seen a massive evolution in how hands-on fathers are.嗯，在某些情况下，你知道，父亲会疏忽大意，有些父亲缺席，而另一些父亲只是觉得自己非常，我想，我们会说一个 1950 年代的父亲如此疏远，管教者实际上没有参与孩子的日常生活，当然也没有参与他们的照顾。所以，今天的一代父亲，即使在我研究父亲的 10 年里，我们也看到了父亲亲力亲为的方式发生了巨大的变化。 Neil(尼尔)She talks there about some negative characteristics associated with dads in the past. She suggests that some fathers didn’t have a very close relationship with their sons, they were absent which means they weren’t at home a lot and ‘didn’t spend time’ with their children.她在那里谈到了过去与父亲相关的一些负面特征。她认为，一些父亲与儿子的关系不是很密切，他们不在，这意味着他们不经常在家，并且“没有花时间”陪伴孩子。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Yes, and some fathers were seen as a disciplinarian. That describes someone whose main communication with their children was to give them strict rules and tell them off or punish them if they did something wrong.是的，有些父亲被视为管教者。这描述了一个人与孩子的主要沟通是给他们严格的规则，如果他们做错了什么，就会责备他们或惩罚他们。 Neil(尼尔)These days, according to Dr Machin, fathers are much more hands-on. This phrase means they are ‘much more involved’ with their children and share bringing up their children with their partners.根据 Machin 博士的说法，如今，父亲们更加亲力亲为。这句话的意思是他们“更多地参与”自己的孩子，并与伴侣共同抚养孩子。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And talking of sharing, Neil, come on – it’s time to know the answer to today’s question.说到分享，Neil，来吧 —— 是时候知道今天问题的答案了。 Neil(尼尔)Yes indeed. According to recent research in the UK, what is the percentage of fathers who are there when their children are born? Was it 55%, 75% or 95%?确实是的。根据英国最近的研究，孩子出生时在场的父亲的百分比是多少？是 55%、75% 还是 95%？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)And I said a very optimistic 95%.我说非常乐观的 95%。 Neil(尼尔)Being optimistic is good obviously because you are correct.乐观显然是好的，因为你是对的。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)That’s fantastic!太棒了！ Neil(尼尔)And now, for something else fantastic, our review of today’s vocabulary…现在，为了另一个很棒的事情，我们对今天词汇的回顾…… Catherine(凯瑟 琳)We started off with admit to for when you say something is true, even if it might make you look a little bit bad. And before we go on I have to admit, Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuit.我们首先承认你说某件事是真的，即使它可能会让你看起来有点糟糕。在我们继续之前，我不得不承认，尼尔，是我吃了你的饼干。 Neil(尼尔)Which one?哪一个？ Catherine(凯瑟 琳)The one that you left on the desk.你留在桌子上的那个。 Neil(尼尔)That’s all right. I wasn’t really keen on it anyway. It had been on the floor.没关系。反正我并不是很热衷于它。它一直在地板上。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)What? Yuck!什么？呸！ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, well, it serves you right! And to be keen on something is our next phrase, meaning ‘being very interested in and enthusiastic about’ something.是的，嗯，它为您服务！而 to be keen on something 是我们的下一个短语，意思是 “对某事非常感兴趣和热情”。 Catherine(凯瑟 琳)Then we had to go along with something.

Welcome to 6 Minute English, we’ve got a sweet topic today, and six tempting items of vocabulary. NeilHello, I’m Neil. And we’re going to be talking about sugar, which many of us find tempting. But how much is too much, Rob? RobI don’t know, Neil, but hopefully we’ll be finding that out. I must admit though, I have a sweet tooth, and that means I like sugary things! NeilMe too. But something I’m always seeing in the news these days is that we’re eating too much sugar. And one important factor is that sugars are sometimes hidden in processed foods. RobProcessed food is any food that has been changed in some way, by freezing it or putting it in tins, or by combining foods or adding chemicals. In fact, some of the sugars we eat are hidden in food that we think of as healthy. Such as yoghurts, low fat snacks, and fruit drinks. NeilDo you check the information on the back of food packets, Rob?, To see what’s in them? RobYes, I do. But it can be very confusing, there’s so much information. And I’m not always sure how much of a certain thing is bad. NeilWell, that brings me onto today’s quiz question. Can you tell me, if a food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it… a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle? RobI’ll say low, Neil. NeilOK. Well, we’ll find out later. Some food products have colour coding on the packaging to help you understand the information, don’t they?, red for high levels of sugar, salt or fat– orange for medium, and green for low. RobThat sounds helpful. Then you can see at a glance what’s good or bad for you. NeilAt a glance means with a quick look. OK, let’s listen now to BBC reporter Rajeev Gupta interviewing a man in Chester, in the UK. He’s asking him to guess how much sugar there is in a pot of fat-free yoghurt. Reporter:I’ve actually got a pot of yoghurt in front of me. This says ‘fat-free’ on it and it’s been marketed as being quite healthy. If I was to say how much sugar is in here, what would you say as… say is the quantity of the tub? Interviewee:I’d probably think maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls, you know, it’s quite surprising how much is sugars in all these products, isn’t there? Reporter:Well, there’s about a third of this yoghurt pot is actually sugar. Interviewee:To be honest, that’s quite amazing, that. I would never have thought a third of that would have been sugar just by looking at it. And it does say it’s fat-free. NeilSo the yoghurt is fat-free, which means it doesn’t contain any fat. And the man guessed there might be two teaspoons of sugar in the yoghurt. RobThat’s right. And if something is sugar-free then it doesn’t contain any sugar. But in this case, a third of the yoghurt’s content was sugar. That, to me, sounds like an awful lot, even for someone with a sweet tooth like me! NeilOK, well, let’s listen to Dr Gunter Kuhnle. He’s a Nutritional Biochemist at Reading University. Dr Gunter Kuhnle, nutritional biochemist at Reading University, UKOne problem we see, nutritionists, is sort of this focusing on any individual foods, at one time it was that fat has to be avoided at all costs, now it seems to go towards sugar and sugar is demonised and people link it to drugs and so on. I think this is the wrong way forward. Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet. It is important also to enjoy your food and not do this extreme focusing on one side or one aspect and individual nutrients. RobSo if you avoid something at all costs you do everything you can to avoid it. And demonise means to make someone or something seem very bad. NeilDr Kuhnle thinks that totally cutting out one type of food like this, whether it’s fat or sugar, is wrong. He thinks we should eat a balanced diet, and enjoy our food. RobThat sounds very sensible. Now, how about telling us the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil? NeilThanks for reminding me, Rob. I asked: if food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it… a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle? You said low… and you were… right! Well done! RobThank you. NeilIf foods contain more than 22.5% total sugars per 100g they are classified as high. RobAnd I guess that between 5 and 22.5% they are somewhere in the middle. NeilCorrect! OK, shall we go over the words we heard today? RobYep. First up, if you have a ‘sweet tooth’ it means you like sugary things. For example, ‘My little nephew has a sweet tooth. He eats far too many biscuits and sweets.’ NeilHis dentist won’t be pleased! Number two, ‘processed food’ is any food that has been changed in some way, by freezing it or putting it in tins, or by combining foods or addingchemicals. RobFor example, ‘The meat in sausages is highly processed.’ NeilOh dear, I didn’t know that. I’m a big fan of sausages! RobNumber three, ‘at a glance’, means with a quick look. NeilFor example, ‘I could tell at a glance that I wouldn’t like the food at that restaurant.’ Rob‘Fat-free’ means without any fat in it. For example, ‘I bought this yoghurt because it says fat- free on the label.’ NeilAha, but did you realise that a third of it was sugar! Moving on, If you avoid something ‘at all costs’ you do everything you can to avoid it. For example, ‘I wanted to win the game at all costs.’ RobI didn’t know you were so competitive, Neil! And finally, ‘demonise’, means to make someone or something seem very bad. Neil‘Politicians shouldn’t demonise their opponents.’ RobThey often do though, don’t they? OK. Well, that’s all we have time for on today’s show. But please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages. NeilJoin us again soon!

Welcome to 6 Minute English, we’ve got a sweet topic today, and six tempting items of vocabulary.我是 罗伯。欢迎来到六分钟英语，我们今天有一个甜蜜的话题，以及六个诱人的词汇。 Neil(尼尔)Hello, I’m Neil. And we’re going to be talking about sugar, which many of us find tempting. But how much is too much, Rob?大家好，我是 Neil。我们将讨论糖，我们中的许多人都觉得它很诱人。但是多少才算太多呢，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)I don’t know, Neil, but hopefully we’ll be finding that out. I must admit though, I have a sweet tooth, and that means I like sugary things!我不知道，Neil，但希望我们能找出来。不过我必须承认，我爱吃甜食，这意味着我喜欢含糖的东西！ Neil(尼尔)Me too. But something I’m always seeing in the news these days is that we’re eating too much sugar. And one important factor is that sugars are sometimes hidden in processed foods.我也是。但这些天我总是在新闻中看到的一点是，我们吃了太多的糖。一个重要因素是糖有时隐藏在加工食品中。 Rob(罗伯)Processed food is any food that has been changed in some way, by freezing it or putting it in tins, or by combining foods or adding chemicals. In fact, some of the sugars we eat are hidden in food that we think of as healthy. Such as yoghurts, low fat snacks, and fruit drinks.加工食品是指通过冷冻或放入罐头、混合食物或添加化学品而以某种方式改变的任何食物。事实上，我们吃的一些糖分隐藏在我们认为健康的食物中。如酸奶、低脂零食和果汁饮料。 Neil(尼尔)Do you check the information on the back of food packets, Rob?, To see what’s in them?你检查食品包背面的信息吗，罗伯？，看看里面有什么？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, I do. But it can be very confusing, there’s so much information. And I’m not always sure how much of a certain thing is bad.是的，我愿意。但这可能非常令人困惑，因为信息太多了。而且我并不总是确定某件事有多少是坏的。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that brings me onto today’s quiz question. Can you tell me, if a food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it… a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle?好吧，这让我进入了今天的测验问题。你能告诉我，如果一种食物每 5 克含有 100% 的总糖，是不是……a） 高糖，b） 低糖或 c） 介于两者之间？ Rob(罗伯)I’ll say low, Neil.我说低，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)OK. Well, we’ll find out later. Some food products have colour coding on the packaging to help you understand the information, don’t they?, red for high levels of sugar, salt or fat– orange for medium, and green for low.还行。好吧，我们稍后会知道。一些食品的包装上有颜色编码，以帮助您理解信息，不是吗？红色表示糖、盐或脂肪含量高 —— 橙色表示中等，绿色表示低。 Rob(罗伯)That sounds helpful. Then you can see at a glance what’s good or bad for you.这听起来很有帮助。然后，您可以一目了然地看到什么对您有利或有害。 Neil(尼尔)At a glance means with a quick look. OK, let’s listen now to BBC reporter Rajeev Gupta interviewing a man in Chester, in the UK. He’s asking him to guess how much sugar there is in a pot of fat-free yoghurt.一目了然意味着快速浏览。好，现在让我们听听 BBC 记者 Rajeev Gupta 在英国切斯特采访一名男子。他让他猜猜一罐无脂酸奶里有多少糖。 Reporter:(记者：)I’ve actually got a pot of yoghurt in front of me. This says ‘fat-free’ on it and it’s been marketed as being quite healthy. If I was to say how much sugar is in here, what would you say as… say is the quantity of the tub?实际上，我面前有一罐酸奶。上面写着“无脂肪”，它被宣传为非常健康。如果我要说这里有多少糖，你会怎么说……比如说浴缸的数量是多少？ Interviewee:(应聘者：)I’d probably think maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls, you know, it’s quite surprising how much is sugars in all these products, isn’t there?我可能会想也许是几茶匙，你知道，所有这些产品中的糖含量都令人惊讶，不是吗？ Reporter:(记者：)Well, there’s about a third of this yoghurt pot is actually sugar.嗯，这个酸奶罐里大约有三分之一实际上是糖。 Interviewee:(应聘者：)To be honest, that’s quite amazing, that. I would never have thought a third of that would have been sugar just by looking at it. And it does say it’s fat-free.老实说，这真是太神奇了。我从来没有想过其中的三分之一会是糖。它确实说它是无脂肪的。 Neil(尼尔)So the yoghurt is fat-free, which means it doesn’t contain any fat. And the man guessed there might be two teaspoons of sugar in the yoghurt.所以酸奶不含脂肪，这意味着它不含任何脂肪。那个人猜酸奶里可能有两茶匙的糖。 Rob(罗伯)That’s right. And if something is sugar-free then it doesn’t contain any sugar. But in this case, a third of the yoghurt’s content was sugar. That, to me, sounds like an awful lot, even for someone with a sweet tooth like me!没错。如果某样东西不含糖，那么它就不含任何糖。但在这种情况下，酸奶中三分之一的成分是糖。对我来说，这听起来很可怕，即使对于像我这样爱吃甜食的人来说也是如此！ Neil(尼尔)OK, well, let’s listen to Dr Gunter Kuhnle. He’s a Nutritional Biochemist at Reading University.好，好，让我们听听 Gunter Kuhnle 博士的演讲。他是雷丁大学的营养生物化学家。 Dr Gunter Kuhnle, nutritional biochemist at Reading University, UK(GunterKuhnle博士，英国雷丁大学营养生物化学家)One problem we see, nutritionists, is sort of this focusing on any individual foods, at one time it was that fat has to be avoided at all costs, now it seems to go towards sugar and sugar is demonised and people link it to drugs and so on. I think this is the wrong way forward. Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet. It is important also to enjoy your food and not do this extreme focusing on one side or one aspect and individual nutrients.营养学家看到的一个问题是，这种关注任何单独的食物，曾经是必须不惜一切代价避免脂肪，现在它似乎转向了糖，糖被妖魔化了，人们将其与药物等联系起来。我认为这是错误的前进方向。个人，是的，你应该有均衡的饮食。享受你的食物也很重要，不要做这种极端的事情，只关注一侧或一个方面以及个别营养物质。 Rob(罗伯)So if you avoid something at all costs you do everything you can to avoid it. And demonise means to make someone or something seem very bad.因此，如果你不惜一切代价避免某件事，你就会尽一切可能避免它。而 demonise 的意思是让某人或某事看起来非常糟糕。 Neil(尼尔)Dr Kuhnle thinks that totally cutting out one type of food like this, whether it’s fat or sugar, is wrong. He thinks we should eat a balanced diet, and enjoy our food.Kuhnle 博士认为，完全戒掉这样的一种食物，无论是脂肪还是糖，都是错误的。他认为我们应该均衡饮食，享受我们的食物。 Rob(罗伯)That sounds very sensible. Now, how about telling us the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil?这听起来很合理。现在，告诉我们今天测验问题的答案怎么样，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)Thanks for reminding me, Rob. I asked: if food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it… a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle? You said low… and you were… right! Well done!谢谢你提醒我，罗伯。我问：如果食物每 5 克含有 100% 的总糖，是不是……a） 高糖，b） 低糖或 c） 介于两者之间？你说的低……而你是……右！干的好！ Rob(罗伯)Thank you.谢谢。 Neil(尼尔)If foods contain more than 22.5% total sugars per 100g they are classified as high.如果每 22.5 克食物的总糖含量超过 100%，则被归类为高糖。 Rob(罗伯)And I guess that between 5 and 22.5% they are somewhere in the middle.我猜在 5% 到 22.5% 之间，他们介于两者之间。 Neil(尼尔)Correct! OK, shall we go over the words we heard today?正确！好，我们来回顾一下我们今天听到的词吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yep. First up, if you have a ‘sweet tooth’ it means you like sugary things. For example, ‘My little nephew has a sweet tooth. He eats far too many biscuits and sweets.’是的。首先，如果你“爱吃甜食”，这意味着你喜欢含糖的东西。例如，’我的小侄子爱吃甜食。他吃了太多的饼干和糖果。 Neil(尼尔)His dentist won’t be pleased! Number two, ‘processed food’ is any food that has been他的牙医不会高兴的！第二，“加工食品”是指任何已经 changed in some way, by freezing it or putting it in tins, or by combining foods or adding(以某种方式改变，通过冷冻或放入罐头，或通过混合食物或添加)chemicals.化学药品。 Rob(罗伯)For example, ‘The meat in sausages is highly processed.’例如，’香肠中的肉是高度加工的。 Neil(尼尔)Oh dear, I didn’t know that. I’m a big fan of sausages!哦，天哪，我不知道。我是香肠的忠实粉丝！ Rob(罗伯)Number three, ‘at a glance’, means with a quick look.第三个数字，“一目了然”，意思是快速浏览。 Neil(尼尔)For example, ‘I could tell at a glance that I wouldn’t like the food at that restaurant.’例如，“我一眼就能看出我不喜欢那家餐厅的食物。 Rob(罗伯)‘Fat-free’ means without any fat in it. For example, ‘I bought this yoghurt because it says fat- free on the label.’“无脂肪”意味着不含任何脂肪。例如，“我买了这个酸奶，因为它在标签上写着 Fat- free。 Neil(尼尔)Aha, but did you realise that a third of it was sugar! Moving on, If you avoid something ‘at all costs’ you do everything you can to avoid it. For example, ‘I wanted to win the game at all costs.’啊哈，但你有没有意识到其中三分之一是糖！继续前进，如果你 “不惜一切代价 ”避免某件事，你就会尽一切可能避免它。例如，’我想不惜一切代价赢得比赛。 Rob(罗伯)I didn’t know you were so competitive, Neil! And finally, ‘demonise’, means to make someone or something seem very bad.我不知道你这么好胜，尼尔！最后，“demonise”的意思是让某人或某事看起来非常糟糕。 Neil(尼尔)‘Politicians shouldn’t demonise their opponents.’“政客不应该妖魔化他们的对手。” Rob(罗伯)They often do though, don’t they? OK. Well, that’s all we have time for on today’s show. But please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.不过他们经常这样做，不是吗？还行。好了，这就是我们今天节目的全部时间。但请查看我们的 Instagram、Twitter、Facebook 和 YouTube 页面。 Neil(尼尔)Join us again soon!

NeilAnd I’m Neil… And today we’re talking about wetiquette! What’s that, Rob? RobI have no idea! NeilWell, you won’t find wetiquette in many dictionaries, it actually means ‘swimming pool etiquette’. W-etiquette, get it? Etiquette is a set of rules for how to behave in social situations. And wetiquette is a set of dos and don’ts to keep things calm in the water. RobDos and don’ts are also rules telling us how to behave. So things like ‘No running by the pool’ or ‘No diving in the shallow end’. Am I right? NeilYes and no, Rob. Those are traditional swimming pool rules. But wetiquette covers slightly different things. RobOK, well before we get to those, I have a question for you, Neil. According to the US Water Quality and Health Council, how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it… a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%. NeilWell, I’m going to be optimistic and say 7%, Rob. RobSo I take it you do always take a shower before swimming, Neil? NeilCorrect. Taking a quick shower is such an easy thing to do, and it stops all that horrible sweat and bacteria getting in the pool water! I can’t understand why some people don’t do it! RobI can see it’s making you quite hot under the collar - and that means angry. Let’s listen to swimming specialist, Jenny Landreth, talking about what annoys her. Jenny Landreth:I’m very keen on my wetiquette in the pool. Interviewer:It’s that thing where people can get quite cross about, which is: Do you go around clockwise or anticlockwise? Do you overtake or not? Jenny Landreth:People need a rule. We need to observe the rules of the pool and I’m very keen on that. Most other swimmers will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool. And don’t know how to observe the rules of that lane. Interviewer:Lane rage, you mean if you’re a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast lane? Jenny Landreth:Well, I hate to say it, but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed and think they’re slightly faster than they are. Interviewer:Ah! The male ego here! Jenny Landreth:They quite often don’t like it if there’s a woman swimming faster than them. So very often they’ll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetiquette to get in the correct lane. Interviewer:Know your speed. Jenny Landreth:Yes. RobThat was Jenny Landreth, a swimming specialist, talking about the things that annoy her about other people in the pool. NeilYes. Jenny doesn’t like it when people are slower that they should be for the fast lane. Older men, like you, Rob. RobNeil, how dare you! Yes, Jenny gets ‘lane rage’. NeilLane rage! Where swimmers get hot under the collar when there’s a slow swimmer in the fast lane. RobSwimming lanes are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’. Do you know your speed, Neil? NeilYes, I’m fast. RobAre you sure you are not misjudging your speed? Do you think you might actually be a medium-fast swimmer? NeilTo misjudge means to guess something wrongly. And our ego is the idea we have of ourselves, with regards to how important we feel we are. And to answer your question, Rob, no, I’m definitely fast. RobAre there other things swimmers should be aware of in the pool? NeilYes, if somebody taps your foot, it means they want to overtake you. RobOvertaking means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them. NeilI hate it when swimmers overtake me! RobReally, Neil? Is that your male ego talking? NeilNo, not at all, I just hate getting splashed. RobI see. Well perhaps now is a good time to move on and hear the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: How many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it… a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%? NeilI said 7% and I hope I’m right. RobWell, I’m afraid you’re wrong, Neil. It’s actually ten times that amount, it’s 70%! The 2012 US report from Water Quality and Health Council found that around 70% of people do not shower before taking a swim in the pool, adding to the number of germs in the water. NeilPerhaps swimming pools should start fining people who don’t take a shower? That might make a difference. Now, let’s go over the words we learned today. RobYes, the first one is ‘dos and don’ts’, which are rules telling us how to behave in a particular situation. For example, “What are the dos and don’ts of meeting the Queen?” NeilGood question, Is the correct etiquette to call her Your Highness or Ma’am? Are there certain subjects you shouldn’t talk about? RobDo you shake her hand or curtsy? NeilThese are things you need to know, or else the Queen might get ‘hot under collar’, that’s our next word, and it means angry! Rob“Both politicians got hot under the collar and insulted each other.” NeilOK, number three is ‘lanes’, which are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’. Rob“Our British Olympic gold medallist is swimming in lane one.” NeilOur next word is ‘misjudge’ which means to guess something wrongly. For example, “I’m sorry I misjudged you, Rob. Please forgive me.” RobOh alright then, Neil. But don’t misjudge me again OK? Next up is ‘ego’, which is our sense of how important we are. Neil“Losing the race was a huge blow to her ego.” RobAnd our final word is ‘overtake’, which means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them. Neil“I don’t enjoy overtaking big lorries on the motorway.” RobNeither do I, Neil. Now one of the don’ts of this show is not talking for more than six minutes. So it’s time to say goodbye! NeilBut please visit our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and tell us what makes you hot under the collar! RobAnd remember, you can explore our website: bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find guides to grammar, exercises, videos and articles to read and improve your English. Bye bye!

What’s that, Rob?我是 Neil……今天我们来谈谈礼仪！那是什么，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)I have no idea!我不知道！ Neil(尼尔)Well, you won’t find wetiquette in many dictionaries, it actually means ‘swimming pool etiquette’. W-etiquette, get it? Etiquette is a set of rules for how to behave in social situations. And wetiquette is a set of dos and don’ts to keep things calm in the water.嗯，你不会在很多词典中找到 wetiquette，它实际上是 “游泳池礼仪 ”的意思。W 礼仪，明白吗？礼仪是一套关于在社交场合如何表现的规则。Wetiquette 是一系列注意事项，以保持水中平静。 Rob(罗伯)Dos and don’ts are also rules telling us how to behave. So things like ‘No running by the pool’ or ‘No diving in the shallow end’. Am I right?该做什么和不该做什么也是告诉我们如何表现的规则。比如’禁止在泳池边跑步’或’禁止在浅水区潜水’。我说得对吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes and no, Rob. Those are traditional swimming pool rules. But wetiquette covers slightly different things.是的，也不是，罗伯。这些是传统的游泳池规则。但 wetiquett 涵盖的内容略有不同。 Rob(罗伯)OK, well before we get to those, I have a question for you, Neil. According to the US Water Quality and Health Council, how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it… a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%.好的，在我们开始之前，我有一个问题要问你，Neil。根据美国水质与健康委员会的数据，有多少人承认在使用游泳池之前没有淋浴？是吗。。。a） 7%，b） 17% 或 c） 70%。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I’m going to be optimistic and say 7%, Rob.好吧，我要乐观地说 7%，罗伯。 Rob(罗伯)So I take it you do always take a shower before swimming, Neil?所以我认为你总是在游泳前洗个澡，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Correct. Taking a quick shower is such an easy thing to do, and it stops all that horrible sweat and bacteria getting in the pool water! I can’t understand why some people don’t do it!正确。快速淋浴是一件很容易的事情，它可以阻止所有可怕的汗水和细菌进入泳池水！我不明白为什么有些人不这样做！ Rob(罗伯)I can see it’s making you quite hot under the collar - and that means angry. Let’s listen to swimming specialist, Jenny Landreth, talking about what annoys her.我看得出来，你的衣领下面很热 —— 这意味着生气。让我们听听游泳专家 Jenny Landreth 谈论让她烦恼的原因。 Jenny Landreth:(珍妮·兰德雷斯：)I’m very keen on my wetiquette in the pool.我非常热衷于在游泳池里的礼仪。 Interviewer:(访问者：)It’s that thing where people can get quite cross about, which is: Do you go around clockwise or anticlockwise? Do you overtake or not?这是人们可以非常困惑的地方，那就是：你是顺时针还是逆时针？你超车还是不超车？ Jenny Landreth:(珍妮·兰德雷斯：)People need a rule. We need to observe the rules of the pool and I’m very keen on that. Most other swimmers will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool. And don’t know how to observe the rules of that lane.人们需要一个规则。我们需要遵守泳池规则，我非常热衷于这一点。如果人们在游泳池的错误车道上，大多数其他游泳者都会遭受泳道愤怒症。并且不知道如何遵守那条车道的规则。 Interviewer:(访问者：)Lane rage, you mean if you’re a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast lane?Lane rage，你的意思是如果你是一个慢速游泳者，你敢于进入快车道？ Jenny Landreth:(珍妮·兰德雷斯：)Well, I hate to say it, but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed and think they’re slightly faster than they are.好吧，我不想这么说，但很多时候，绅士们经常误判他们的速度，认为他们比实际速度略快。 Interviewer:(访问者：)Ah! The male ego here!啊！这里的男性自我！ Jenny Landreth:(珍妮·兰德雷斯：)They quite often don’t like it if there’s a woman swimming faster than them. So very often they’ll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetiquette to get in the correct lane.他们通常不喜欢有女人游得比他们快。所以很多时候他们会走稍微快一点的车道，应该通过礼仪轻轻地鼓励他们进入正确的车道。 Interviewer:(访问者：)Know your speed.了解您的速度。 Jenny Landreth:(珍妮·兰德雷斯：)Yes.是的。 Rob(罗伯)That was Jenny Landreth, a swimming specialist, talking about the things that annoy her about other people in the pool.那是游泳专家珍妮·兰德雷斯 （Jenny Landreth） 谈论让她对游泳池里其他人感到恼火的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. Jenny doesn’t like it when people are slower that they should be for the fast lane. Older men, like you, Rob.是的。Jenny 不喜欢人们慢得比他们应该走快车道的慢。像你这样的年长男人，罗伯。 Rob(罗伯)Neil, how dare you! Yes, Jenny gets ‘lane rage’.尼尔，你怎么敢！是的，Jenny 得了“车道怒症”。 Neil(尼尔)Lane rage! Where swimmers get hot under the collar when there’s a slow swimmer in the fast lane.车道愤怒！当快车道上有慢速游泳者时，游泳者的衣领下会很热。 Rob(罗伯)Swimming lanes are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’. Do you know your speed, Neil?泳道是游泳池的垂直部分，通常被标记为“快速”、“中等”和“慢速”。你知道你的速度吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I’m fast.是的，我很快。 Rob(罗伯)Are you sure you are not misjudging your speed? Do you think you might actually be a medium-fast swimmer?您确定您没有误判自己的速度吗？您认为您真的可能是一名中速游泳运动员吗？ Neil(尼尔)To misjudge means to guess something wrongly. And our ego is the idea we have of ourselves, with regards to how important we feel we are. And to answer your question, Rob, no, I’m definitely fast.To misjudge 的意思是猜错了某事。而我们的自我就是我们对自己的想法，关于我们觉得自己有多重要。为了回答你的问题，罗伯，不，我肯定很快。 Rob(罗伯)Are there other things swimmers should be aware of in the pool?游泳者在游泳池中还应该注意其他事项吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, if somebody taps your foot, it means they want to overtake you.是的，如果有人轻拍你的脚，那就意味着他们想超过你。 Rob(罗伯)Overtaking means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.超车的意思是超过另一个朝同一方向行驶的人，因为你比他们走得更快。 Neil(尼尔)I hate it when swimmers overtake me!我讨厌游泳者超过我！ Rob(罗伯)Really, Neil? Is that your male ego talking?真的吗，尼尔？那是你的男性自我在说话吗？ Neil(尼尔)No, not at all, I just hate getting splashed.不，一点也不，我只是讨厌被溅到。 Rob(罗伯)I see. Well perhaps now is a good time to move on and hear the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: How many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it… a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%?明白了。好吧，也许现在是继续前进并聆听今天测验问题的答案的好时机。记得我问过：有多少人承认在使用游泳池之前没有洗澡？是吗。。。a） 7%， b） 17% 还是 c） 70%？ Neil(尼尔)I said 7% and I hope I’m right.我说 7%，我希望我是对的。 Rob(罗伯)Well, I’m afraid you’re wrong, Neil. It’s actually ten times that amount, it’s 70%! The 2012 US report from Water Quality and Health Council found that around 70% of people do not shower before taking a swim in the pool, adding to the number of germs in the water.嗯，恐怕你错了，尼尔。实际上是这个数字的十倍，是 70%！水质与健康委员会 2012 年美国报告发现，大约 70% 的人在游泳池游泳前不淋浴，这增加了水中的细菌数量。 Neil(尼尔)Perhaps swimming pools should start fining people who don’t take a shower? That might make a difference. Now, let’s go over the words we learned today.也许游泳池应该开始对不洗澡的人处以罚款？这可能会有所作为。现在，让我们回顾一下我们今天学到的单词。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, the first one is ‘dos and don’ts’, which are rules telling us how to behave in a particular situation. For example, “What are the dos and don’ts of meeting the Queen?”是的，第一个是“该做和不该做”，这是告诉我们在特定情况下如何表现的规则。例如，“与女王见面的注意事项是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Good question, Is the correct etiquette to call her Your Highness or Ma’am? Are there certain subjects you shouldn’t talk about?好问题，称她为殿下或马是正确的礼仪吗？有没有你不应该谈论的某些话题？ Rob(罗伯)Do you shake her hand or curtsy?你是握手还是行屈膝礼？ Neil(尼尔)These are things you need to know, or else the Queen might get ‘hot under collar’, that’s our next word, and it means angry!这些是你需要知道的事情，否则女王可能会变得 “衣领下很热”，这是我们的下一个词，意思是生气！ Rob(罗伯)“Both politicians got hot under the collar and insulted each other.”“两位政客都发火了，互相侮辱。” Neil(尼尔)OK, number three is ‘lanes’, which are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’.好的，第三个是“泳道”，这是游泳池的垂直部分，通常被标记为“快”、“中”和“慢”。 Rob(罗伯)“Our British Olympic gold medallist is swimming in lane one.”“我们的英国奥运金牌得主在第一泳道游泳。” Neil(尼尔)Our next word is ‘misjudge’ which means to guess something wrongly. For example, “I’m sorry I misjudged you, Rob. Please forgive me.”我们的下一个词是 ‘misjudge’，意思是猜错了。例如，“很抱歉我误判了你，罗伯。请原谅我。 Rob(罗伯)Oh alright then, Neil. But don’t misjudge me again OK? Next up is ‘ego’, which is our sense of how important we are.哦，好吧，尼尔。但不要再误判我了，好吗？接下来是“自我”，即我们对自己有多重要的看法。 Neil(尼尔)“Losing the race was a huge blow to her ego.”“输掉比赛对她的自尊心是一个巨大的打击。” Rob(罗伯)And our final word is ‘overtake’, which means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.我们的最后一个词是 “overover”，意思是超过另一个朝同一方向行驶的人，因为你比他们走得更快。 Neil(尼尔)“I don’t enjoy overtaking big lorries on the motorway.”“我不喜欢在高速公路上超车。” Rob(罗伯)Neither do I, Neil. Now one of the don’ts of this show is not talking for more than six minutes. So it’s time to say goodbye!我也没有，尼尔。现在这个节目的禁忌之一是说话时间不超过六分钟。所以，是时候说再见了！ Neil(尼尔)But please visit our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and tell us what makes you hot under the collar!但请访问我们的 Twitter、Facebook 和 YouTube 页面，告诉我们是什么让您在衣领下炙手可热！ Rob(罗伯)And remember, you can explore our website: bbclearningenglish.com, where you’ll find guides to grammar, exercises, videos and articles to read and improve your English.

I’m Rob. NeilAnd I’m Neil. And today we’re talking about water, there’s nothing more refreshing than an ice-cold bottle of water straight out of the vending machine. Ah! RobOK. Refreshing in this context means making you feel cool again after being hot. So has that cooled you down, Neil? NeilYes, I feel very refreshed now, thanks. RobCan I ask you though, why didn’t you just get a glass of water from the kitchen tap? That water is cool and refreshing too, and it’s free! NeilWell, I like this brand of bottled water better, it’s enriched with salts and minerals that are very beneficial to your health. Enriched means improving the quality of something by adding to it. RobEnriched!! Honestly, Neil! NeilIt tastes better, Rob. RobYeah. NeilAnd I’m not the only one who thinks so. For the first time in the UK, bottled water is more popular than cola. In fact, can you tell me how many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it. a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres? RobRight. Well, I’m going to say 29 million litres. NeilOK. We’ll find out later if you got that right or wrong. But seriously, Rob, don’t you think it’s a good thing that people are choosing to buy bottled water at the supermarket rather than fizzy drinks? RobYes, of course. But as I said to you earlier, why don’t people just drink tap water? Let’s listen to Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution, and of course, bottled water causes a huge amount of that. Here’s Natalie now, talking about how drinks manufacturers have persuaded people that bottled water is better for them. Natalie Fee, founder of City to SeaThey manufactured the demand for bottled water and they spent millions of pounds on adverts sort of scaring us off of tap water. The bottled water companies set out to make us believe that tap water wasn’t healthy. And yet, tap water is way more regulated than bottled water is, and in taste tests, tap water comes up trumps most times. NeilIf you manufacture something you make it in large amounts in a factory. But here Natalie says the drinks companies ‘manufactured the demand for bottled water’. RobWhich means they made adverts to persuade people that tap water wasn’t healthy, and bottled water was. NeilHmm, To scare people off, What does that mean, Rob? RobWell, if you scare somebody off you make them go away by frightening them. So some advertisers may have suggested, for example, that tap water was unsafe to drink . NeilWhereas bottled water was safer, and tasted better too! RobYou’re catching on! However, Natalie Fee claims that tap water is more regulated than bottled water is. NeilRegulated means controlled. Natalie also says that in taste tests tap water comes up trumps. What does she mean by that? RobWell, a taste test is where you ask people to try several very similar products without knowing which one is which, and then you grade them according to which you like the best. And if something comes up trumps, it means it produces a good result, often unexpectedly. NeilSo tap water comes up trumps, eh? RobYup. Perhaps you should try a taste test now, Neil? It would be interesting to see if your enriched bottled water comes up trumps of not! NeilI tell you what, let’s leave that until later and hear the answer to today’s quiz question instead. RobOK. NeilI asked you: How many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it. a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres? RobYeah. And I said 29 million litres. NeilAnd the answer is. 2.9 billion litres. RobWow! NeilYou can buy many different brands of bottled water with a range of price tags. At the top end, there’s water from a 4,000 year-old Norwegian iceberg. RobHow much does that cost? NeilAround £80 a bottle. RobAs cheap as that? I’ll pop out and get some later. OK let’s review the words we learned today. The first one was ‘refreshing’, which means making you feel cool again after being hot. Neil“I enjoyed a refreshing cup of tea.” RobWe British like to say that, don’t we? Though I don’t understand how a hot drink can be refreshing. OK, number two, ‘enriched’, which means improving the quality of something by adding to it. For example, “Did you know that many types of breakfast cereal are enriched with vitamins and minerals, Neil?” NeilNo, I didn’t, Rob. You learn something new every day. Number three is ‘manufacture’, to make something in large amounts in a factory. “This company manufactures wellington boots.” Rob“I am a wellington boot manufacturer.” That has a nice ring to it. Anyway, when you scare someone off you make them go away by frightening them. “The dog barked fiercely and scared off the two burglars.” NeilDown, Rob, down! Number five, ‘regulated’, or controlled, for example, “The sale of tobacco is tightly regulated by the government.” RobAnd finally, if something ‘comes up trumps’ it produces a good result, often unexpectedly. Neil“My lottery ticket came up trumps again! I can’t believe it!” RobYou’re a lucky man, Neil. OK, it’s time to do that taste test now. If you have an opinion on bottled water or anything else, please tell us about it on our Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube pages. NeilOK. This one definitely tastes better. RobAnd how about this one? NeilYeah, definitely. RobThat’s the tap water, Neil. NeilNo, no, no. I refuse to believe it! 【中英文双语脚本】Rob(罗伯)Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we introduce a refreshing topic and six related items of vocabulary. I’m Rob.欢迎来到六分钟英语，我们在这里介绍了一个令人耳目一新的话题和六个相关的词汇项目。我是 罗伯。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. And today we’re talking about water, there’s nothing more refreshing than an ice-cold bottle of water straight out of the vending machine. Ah!我是 Neil。今天我们谈论的是水，没有什么比直接从自动售货机里出来的一瓶冰凉的水更令人耳目一新的了。啊！ Rob(罗伯)OK. Refreshing in this context means making you feel cool again after being hot. So has that cooled you down, Neil?好的。在这种情况下，刷新意味着让你在热之后再次感到凉爽。那么，这让你冷静下来了吗，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I feel very refreshed now, thanks.是的，我现在感觉很精神焕发，谢谢。 Rob(罗伯)Can I ask you though, why didn’t you just get a glass of water from the kitchen tap? That water is cool and refreshing too, and it’s free!不过，我能问你一下，你为什么不从厨房的水龙头里打一杯水呢？那水也很凉爽，很清爽，而且是免费的！ Neil(尼尔)Well, I like this brand of bottled water better, it’s enriched with salts and minerals that are very beneficial to your health. Enriched means improving the quality of something by adding to it.嗯，我更喜欢这个牌子的瓶装水，它富含盐和矿物质，对你的健康非常有益。丰富意味着通过添加来提高某物的质量。 Rob(罗伯)Enriched!! Honestly, Neil!丰富！！老实说，尼尔！ Neil(尼尔)It tastes better, Rob.味道更好，罗伯。 Rob(罗伯)Yeah.是的。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m not the only one who thinks so. For the first time in the UK, bottled water is more popular than cola. In fact, can you tell me how many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it. a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres?而且我不是唯一一个这么认为的人。在英国，瓶装水首次比可乐更受欢迎。事实上，您能告诉我 2016 年英国售出了多少升瓶装水吗？是这样。a） 29 亿升，b） 2900 万升还是 c） 290 万升？ Rob(罗伯)Right. Well, I’m going to say 29 million litres.好的。嗯，我要说的是 2900 万升。 Neil(尼尔)OK. We’ll find out later if you got that right or wrong. But seriously, Rob, don’t you think it’s a good thing that people are choosing to buy bottled water at the supermarket rather than fizzy drinks?还行。我们稍后会知道你是对还是错。但说真的，罗伯，你不觉得人们选择在超市买瓶装水而不是碳酸饮料是一件好事吗？ Rob(罗伯)Yes, of course. But as I said to you earlier, why don’t people just drink tap water? Let’s listen to Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution, and of course, bottled water causes a huge amount of that. Here’s Natalie now, talking about how drinks manufacturers have persuaded people that bottled water is better for them.是的，当然。但正如我之前对你说的，为什么人们不喝自来水呢？让我们听听 City to Sea 的创始人 Natalie Fee 的话，该组织致力于反对塑料污染，当然，瓶装水造成了大量塑料污染。现在是 Natalie，她谈论饮料制造商如何说服人们瓶装水对他们更好。 Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea(NatalieFee，CitytoSea创始人)They manufactured the demand for bottled water and they spent millions of pounds on adverts sort of scaring us off of tap water. The bottled water companies set out to make us believe that tap water wasn’t healthy. And yet, tap water is way more regulated than bottled water is, and in taste tests, tap water comes up trumps most times.他们制造了对瓶装水的需求，并在广告上花费了数百万英镑，有点吓跑了我们自来水。瓶装水公司开始让我们相信自来水不健康。然而，自来水比瓶装水受到更多的监管，而且在口味测试中，自来水大多数时候都胜过自来水。 Neil(尼尔)If you manufacture something you make it in large amounts in a factory. But here Natalie says the drinks companies ‘manufactured the demand for bottled water’.如果你制造一些东西，你就在工厂里大量生产。但 Natalie 说，饮料公司“制造了对瓶装水的需求”。 Rob(罗伯)Which means they made adverts to persuade people that tap water wasn’t healthy, and bottled water was.这意味着他们制作广告来说服人们自来水不健康，而瓶装水是。 Neil(尼尔)Hmm, To scare people off, What does that mean, Rob?嗯，吓跑人们，这是什么意思，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)Well, if you scare somebody off you make them go away by frightening them. So some advertisers may have suggested, for example, that tap water was unsafe to drink .好吧，如果你吓跑了某人，你就通过吓唬他们来让他们走开。因此，一些广告商可能已经暗示，例如，自来水饮用不安全。 Neil(尼尔)Whereas bottled water was safer, and tasted better too!而瓶装水更安全，味道也更好！ Rob(罗伯)You’re catching on! However, Natalie Fee claims that tap water is more regulated than bottled water is.你赶上了！然而，娜塔莉·费 （Natalie Fee） 声称，自来水比瓶装水受到更严格的监管。 Neil(尼尔)Regulated means controlled. Natalie also says that in taste tests tap water comes up trumps. What does she mean by that?受监管意味着受控。Natalie 还说，在口味测试中，自来水胜过。她这句话是什么意思？ Rob(罗伯)Well, a taste test is where you ask people to try several very similar products without knowing which one is which, and then you grade them according to which you like the best. And if something comes up trumps, it means it produces a good result, often unexpectedly.嗯，口味测试是你让人们尝试几种非常相似的产品，但不知道哪一种是哪一种，然后你根据你最喜欢的产品对它们进行分级。如果某件事胜出，那就意味着它产生了一个好的结果，通常是出乎意料的。 Neil(尼尔)So tap water comes up trumps, eh?所以自来水胜过一切，嗯？ Rob(罗伯)Yup. Perhaps you should try a taste test now, Neil? It would be interesting to see if your enriched bottled water comes up trumps of not!是的。也许你现在应该尝试一下口味测试，尼尔？看看您的浓缩瓶装水是否胜过不喝，这将是一件有趣的事情！ Neil(尼尔)I tell you what, let’s leave that until later and hear the answer to today’s quiz question instead.我告诉你什么，让我们把这个问题留到以后再听听今天测验问题的答案。 Rob(罗伯)OK.还行。 Neil(尼尔)I asked you: How many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it. a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres?我问你：2016 年英国售出了多少升瓶装水？是这样。a） 29 亿升，b） 2900 万升还是 c） 290 万升？ Rob(罗伯)Yeah. And I said 29 million litres.是的。我说的是 2900 万升。 Neil(尼尔)And the answer is. 2.9 billion litres.答案是。29 亿升。 Rob(罗伯)Wow!哇！ Neil(尼尔)You can buy many different brands of bottled water with a range of price tags. At the top end, there’s water from a 4,000 year-old Norwegian iceberg.您可以购买许多不同品牌的瓶装水，价格各不相同。在顶端，有来自一座 4,000 年历史的挪威冰山的水。 Rob(罗伯)How much does that cost?那要花多少钱？ Neil(尼尔)Around £80 a bottle.每瓶约 80 英镑。 Rob(罗伯)As cheap as that? I’ll pop out and get some later. OK let’s review the words we learned today. The first one was ‘refreshing’, which means making you feel cool again after being hot.就这么便宜？我稍后会弹出来拿一些。好，让我们回顾一下我们今天学到的单词。第一个是 “refreshing”，意思是让你在热之后再次感到凉爽。 Neil(尼尔)“I enjoyed a refreshing cup of tea.”“我喜欢喝一杯清爽的茶。” Rob(罗伯)We British like to say that, don’t we? Though I don’t understand how a hot drink can be refreshing. OK, number two, ‘enriched’, which means improving the quality of something by adding to it. For example, “Did you know that many types of breakfast cereal are enriched with vitamins and minerals, Neil?”我们英国人喜欢这么说，不是吗？虽然我不明白热饮怎么会让人提神。好的，第二点，“丰富”，意思是通过添加来提高某物的质量。例如，“你知道很多类型的早餐麦片都富含维生素和矿物质吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)No, I didn’t, Rob. You learn something new every day. Number three is ‘manufacture’, to make something in large amounts in a factory. “This company manufactures wellington boots.”不，我没有，罗伯。您每天都会学到新东西。第三点是“制造”，在工厂中大量生产某物。“这家公司生产惠灵顿靴。” Rob(罗伯)“I am a wellington boot manufacturer.” That has a nice ring to it. Anyway, when you scare someone off you make them go away by frightening them. “The dog barked fiercely and scared off the two burglars.”“我是一家惠灵顿靴制造商。”这很不错。无论如何，当你吓跑某人时，你会通过吓唬他们来让他们走开。“狗吠叫得很猛，吓跑了两个窃贼。” Neil(尼尔)Down, Rob, down! Number five, ‘regulated’, or controlled, for example, “The sale of tobacco is tightly regulated by the government.”倒下，罗伯，倒下！第五个，“受监管”或受控制，例如，“烟草销售受到政府的严格监管。 Rob(罗伯)And finally, if something ‘comes up trumps’ it produces a good result, often unexpectedly.最后，如果某件事 “出现胜过”，它就会产生一个好的结果，通常是出乎意料的。 Neil(尼尔)“My lottery ticket came up trumps again! I can’t believe it!”“我的彩票又上来了！我简直不敢相信！ Rob(罗伯)You’re a lucky man, Neil. OK, it’s time to do that taste test now. If you have an opinion on bottled water or anything else, please tell us about it on our Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube pages.你真是个幸运的人，Neil。好了，现在是时候做那个口味测试了。如果您对瓶装水或其他任何事情有任何意见，请在我们的 Twitter、Instagram、Facebook 或 YouTube 页面上告诉我们。 Neil(尼尔)OK. This one definitely tastes better.还行。这个肯定更好吃。 Rob(罗伯)And how about this one?那么这个怎么样？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, definitely.是的，当然。 Rob(罗伯)That’s the tap water, Neil.那是自来水，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)No, no, no.

And welcome to 6 Minute English, where we vigorously discuss a new topic and six related items of vocabulary. RobAnd hello, I’m Rob. Today we’re discussing vigorous exercise, and whether adults take enough of it! Vigorous means using a lot of energy to do something. NeilSo how many steps do you do in a day, Rob? RobHow many steps? How should I know, Neil?, It would be pretty hard to count them all. NeilOh, come on! You can track steps on your phone! I do ten thousand a day, which is the magic number for keeping fit and healthy, apparently. RobNot if you saunter, Neil, surely? Sauntering from the sofa to the fridge and back, Or from the house to the car. NeilWell I never saunter, Rob. Saunter means to walk slowly. And you’d have to make a lot of trips to the fridge to clock up ten thousand steps. To get some vigorous exercise, you need to get out and about, round the park at a brisk pace… RobBrisk means quick and energetic, the opposite of sauntering. OK, well, perhaps you can you tell me, Neil, how many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? Is it… a) 4%, b)14% or c) 40%? NeilI’m going to say… 4% because ten minutes is such a short amount of time! RobIndeed. Now, I’ve got another question for you, Neil. Why is exercise so important? Because it sounds pretty boring, counting steps, going to the gym, running on a machine. NeilWell, when you exercise, you stimulate the body’s natural repair system. Your body will actually stay younger if you exercise! RobThat sounds good. NeilExercise also lowers your risk of developing illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. RobHmm. I’m getting a bit worried now, Neil. But I don’t have enough time to do a thousand steps every day… I’m far too busy! NeilWell, Rob. Now might be a good time to listen to Julia Bradbury. She’s a TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast who will explain how she builds walking into her busy life. Julia Bradbury, TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiastI will walk to meetings instead of catching a bus, or getting a taxi or a car, into meetings. And I will also, if I can’t build that into my working day, if it’s a day when I haven’t got meetings and I’m maybe at home with the kids, I will take the time, I will take my kids out with the buggy and I will definitely do 30-40 minutes at least everyday. Going to the park, going to the shops, picking up my things up en route, and really sort of building it into my life. Taking the stairs and not taking lifts, all of these kinds of little decisions can incrementally build up to create more walking time in your day. RobSo if you build something in to your day, or your life, you include it from the beginning. NeilAnd Julia Bradbury has built walking into her day. Even though she’s very busy too, Rob! You should learn from her! RobSo she walks instead of driving or taking the bus. And takes the stairs instead of the lift. I could do those things. NeilYou could indeed, before you know it, you’d be doing ten thousand steps, because the amount of walking you do in a day builds incrementally. RobIncrementally means gradually increasing in size. OK, well, before I think that over, perhaps I could tell you the answer to today’s quiz question? NeilOK. You asked me: How many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? The options were: a) 4%, b) 14% or c) 40%? RobAnd you said 4%. But I’m afraid it’s actually 40%. And that’s according to the Government body Public Health England here in the UK. NeilOh dear, that’s a lot more people than I expected. But it isn’t that surprising, people in all age groups are leading more sedentary lifestyles these days. Our job is very sedentary – which means it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise! RobWell, I might just run on the spot while we go over the new vocabulary we’ve learned today! NeilGood plan. First up we heard ‘vigorous’, which means using a lot of energy to do something. RobOK. “I am running vigorously on the spot!” NeilGreat example! And good to see you taking some vigorous exercise! Number two – ‘saunter’, means to walk slowly in a relaxed way. “When I saw Rob, I sauntered over to say hello.” RobHi Neil. Number three, ‘brisk’ means quick and energetic. Neil“It’s important to take some brisk exercise every day.” RobYes! And I’m beginning to realise that might be true. NeilYep! I think you’ve done enough jogging for today, Rob. You’ve probably done about a hundred steps. RobIs that all? OK, number four, if you ‘build something in to something’, you include it from the beginning. Neil“It’s important to build regular exercise into your daily routine.” RobVery good advice. Number five is ‘incrementally’ which means gradually increasing in size. NeilIncremental is the adjective. “The company has been making incremental changes to its pay structure.” RobDoes that mean we’re getting a pay rise? NeilI doubt it! And finally, number six, ‘sedentary’ means sitting a lot and not taking much exercise. For example, “It’s bad for your health to lead such a sedentary lifestyle.” RobDuly noted, Neil! Well, it’s time to go now. But if today’s show has inspired you to step out and take more exercise, please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it! NeilGoodbye! RobBye bye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello, I’m Neil. And welcome to 6 Minute English, where we vigorously discuss a new topic and six related items of vocabulary.大家好，我是 Neil。欢迎来到六分钟英语，在这里，我们将热烈讨论一个新话题和六个相关词汇项目。 Rob(罗伯)And hello, I’m Rob. Today we’re discussing vigorous exercise, and whether adults take enough of it! Vigorous means using a lot of energy to do something.大家好，我是 罗伯。今天我们讨论的是剧烈运动，以及成年人是否摄入足够的运动！活力意味着使用大量能量来做某事。 Neil(尼尔)So how many steps do you do in a day, Rob?那么，罗伯，你一天要走多少步呢？ Rob(罗伯)How many steps? How should I know, Neil?, It would be pretty hard to count them all.多少个步骤？我怎么知道呢，尼尔？，要把他们都数出来是相当困难的。 Neil(尼尔)Oh, come on! You can track steps on your phone! I do ten thousand a day, which is the magic number for keeping fit and healthy, apparently.拜托！您可以在手机上跟踪步数！我每天做一万次，这显然是保持健康的神奇数字。 Rob(罗伯)Not if you saunter, Neil, surely? Sauntering from the sofa to the fridge and back, Or from the house to the car.如果你闲逛的话，肯定不会，尼尔，肯定吗？从沙发漫步到冰箱再回来，或者从房子到汽车。 Neil(尼尔)Well I never saunter, Rob. Saunter means to walk slowly. And you’d have to make a lot of trips to the fridge to clock up ten thousand steps. To get some vigorous exercise, you need to get out and about, round the park at a brisk pace…好吧，我从不闲逛，罗伯。Saunter 的意思是慢慢走。而且你得去冰箱很多次才能走一万步。要进行一些剧烈的运动，您需要外出走动，以轻快的步伐在公园周围转一圈…… Rob(罗伯)Brisk means quick and energetic, the opposite of sauntering. OK, well, perhaps you can you tell me, Neil, how many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? Is it… a) 4%, b)14% or c) 40%?轻快的意思是快速和精力充沛，与闲逛相反。好吧，好吧，也许你能告诉我，尼尔，有多少 40 到 60 岁的人每个月快走不到 10 分钟？是吗。。。a） 4%， b） 14% 还是 c） 40%？ Neil(尼尔)I’m going to say… 4% because ten minutes is such a short amount of time!我要说……4%，因为 10 分钟的时间太短了！ Rob(罗伯)Indeed. Now, I’ve got another question for you, Neil. Why is exercise so important? Because it sounds pretty boring, counting steps, going to the gym, running on a machine.事实上。现在，我还有另一个问题要问你，Neil。为什么运动如此重要？因为这听起来很无聊，数步数，去健身房，在机器上跑步。 Neil(尼尔)Well, when you exercise, you stimulate the body’s natural repair system. Your body will actually stay younger if you exercise!好吧，当你运动时，你会刺激身体的自然修复系统。如果你锻炼，你的身体实际上会保持年轻！ Rob(罗伯)That sounds good.听起来不错。 Neil(尼尔)Exercise also lowers your risk of developing illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.运动还可以降低患心脏病、癌症和糖尿病等疾病的风险。 Rob(罗伯)Hmm. I’m getting a bit worried now, Neil. But I don’t have enough time to do a thousand steps every day… I’m far too busy!嗯。我现在有点担心了，Neil。但我没有足够的时间每天做一千步……我太忙了！ Neil(尼尔)Well, Rob. Now might be a good time to listen to Julia Bradbury. She’s a TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast who will explain how she builds walking into her busy life.嗯，罗伯。现在可能是听听 Julia Bradbury 的好时机。她是一名电视节目主持人和户外步行爱好者，她将解释她如何将步行融入她忙碌的生活。 Julia Bradbury, TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast(JuliaBradbury，电视节目主持人和户外步行爱好者)I will walk to meetings instead of catching a bus, or getting a taxi or a car, into meetings. And I will also, if I can’t build that into my working day, if it’s a day when I haven’t got meetings and I’m maybe at home with the kids, I will take the time, I will take my kids out with the buggy and I will definitely do 30-40 minutes at least everyday. Going to the park, going to the shops, picking up my things up en route, and really sort of building it into my life. Taking the stairs and not taking lifts, all of these kinds of little decisions can incrementally build up to create more walking time in your day.我会步行去开会，而不是坐公共汽车，或者坐出租车或汽车去开会。如果我不能在我的工作日中融入这一点，如果我没有开会，也许我在家里和孩子们在一起，我也会花时间，我会带我的孩子开着婴儿车出去，我肯定会每天至少做 30-40 分钟。去公园，去商店，在路上拿我的东西，真的把它融入了我的生活。走楼梯而不是坐电梯，所有这些小决定都可以逐渐积累，从而在您的一天中创造更多的步行时间。 Rob(罗伯)So if you build something in to your day, or your life, you include it from the beginning.因此，如果你在你的一天或你的生活中构建了一些东西，你就从一开始就把它包括进来。 Neil(尼尔)And Julia Bradbury has built walking into her day. Even though she’s very busy too, Rob! You should learn from her!Julia Bradbury 已经将步行融入了她的一天。尽管她也很忙，但 罗伯！你应该向她学习！ Rob(罗伯)So she walks instead of driving or taking the bus. And takes the stairs instead of the lift. I could do those things.所以她走路而不是开车或乘坐公共汽车。然后走楼梯而不是电梯。我可以做那些事情。 Neil(尼尔)You could indeed, before you know it, you’d be doing ten thousand steps, because the amount of walking you do in a day builds incrementally.你确实可以在不知不觉中走一万步，因为你一天的步行量是逐渐增加的。 Rob(罗伯)Incrementally means gradually increasing in size. OK, well, before I think that over, perhaps I could tell you the answer to today’s quiz question?Incrementally 表示逐渐增加大小。好的，好吧，在我仔细考虑之前，也许我可以告诉你今天测验问题的答案？ Neil(尼尔)OK. You asked me: How many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? The options were: a) 4%, b) 14% or c) 40%?还行。你问我：有多少 40 到 60 岁的人每个月快走时间少于 10 分钟？选项是：a） 4%， b） 14% 或 c） 40%？ Rob(罗伯)And you said 4%. But I’m afraid it’s actually 40%. And that’s according to the Government body Public Health England here in the UK.你说的是 4%。但恐怕实际上是 40%。这是根据英国政府机构英格兰公共卫生局的说法。 Neil(尼尔)Oh dear, that’s a lot more people than I expected. But it isn’t that surprising, people in all age groups are leading more sedentary lifestyles these days. Our job is very sedentary – which means it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise!哦，天哪，这比我预期的要多得多。但这并不奇怪，如今所有年龄段的人都过着久坐不动的生活方式。我们的工作非常久坐不动 —— 这意味着它涉及很多坐着，没有太多运动！ Rob(罗伯)Well, I might just run on the spot while we go over the new vocabulary we’ve learned today!好吧，我可能会当场跑来，同时复习我们今天学到的新词汇！ Neil(尼尔)Good plan. First up we heard ‘vigorous’, which means using a lot of energy to do something.好计划。首先，我们听到了 ‘vigorous’，意思是使用大量能量来做某事。 Rob(罗伯)OK. “I am running vigorously on the spot!”“我在原地用力跑！” Neil(尼尔)Great example! And good to see you taking some vigorous exercise! Number two – ‘saunter’, means to walk slowly in a relaxed way. “When I saw Rob, I sauntered over to say hello.”很好的例子！很高兴看到你进行一些剧烈的运动！第二名 - “saunter”，意思是以轻松的方式慢慢走。“当我看到 罗伯 时，我溜达过来打招呼。” Rob(罗伯)Hi Neil. Number three, ‘brisk’ means quick and energetic.嗨，尼尔。第三，“轻快”的意思是快速和精力充沛。 Neil(尼尔)“It’s important to take some brisk exercise every day.”“每天进行一些轻快的运动很重要。” Rob(罗伯)Yes!

You’ve probably done about a hundred steps.是的！我想你今天的慢跑已经够多了，罗伯。你可能已经完成了大约 100 个步骤。 Rob(罗伯)Is that all? OK, number four, if you ‘build something in to something’, you include it from the beginning.就这些吗？好，第四点，如果你 “在某物中构建一些东西”，你就从一开始就包含它。 Neil(尼尔)“It’s important to build regular exercise into your daily routine.”“将定期锻炼融入你的日常生活很重要。” Rob(罗伯)Very good advice. Number five is ‘incrementally’ which means gradually increasing in size.非常好的建议。第五个数字是 “增量 ”的，这意味着规模逐渐增加。 Neil(尼尔)Incremental is the adjective. “The company has been making incremental changes to its pay structure.”增量是形容词。“该公司一直在对其薪酬结构进行渐进式改变。” Rob(罗伯)Does that mean we’re getting a pay rise?这是否意味着我们得到了加薪？ Neil(尼尔)I doubt it!

For example, “It’s bad for your health to lead such a sedentary lifestyle.”我怀疑！最后，第六点，“久坐不动”是指久坐不动，不做太多运动。例如，“过这样久坐不动的生活方式对你的健康有害。 Rob(罗伯)Duly noted, Neil! Well, it’s time to go now.

I’m Neil, and joining me is Rob. RobHello there! And today we’ve got six minutes to talk about honesty and how honest people are, particularly when it comes to spending money. So Neil, what’s an ‘honesty box’? NeilWell, it’s where you pay for something by putting money in a box, but it’s up to you to put in the right amount. A small business might use this method to take money for things like parking your car or buying a newspaper because it means you don’t need a sales assistant. RobBut that means people could take a newspaper or park their car without paying anything! An honesty box relies on people being honest. The adjective honest means truthful and not trying to cheat people. NeilAnd the noun is honesty, the quality of being truthful. Have you ever cheated an honesty box, Rob? RobAbsolutely not! I’ve never have! NeilHonestly? RobHonestly! And to cheat, by the way, means to trick or deceive someone to get something you want. Honesty is the best policy, as they say NeilWhich of course leads us on to our quiz. DanThe 6 minute English quiz! Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’? Was it. a) Donald Trump b) Benjamin Franklin or c) Richard Nixon? RobHonestly, Neil! Everyone will know the answer to that. NeilBut do you know the answer to that, Rob? RobWell, I’ll have an honest guess. I think it’s b) Benjamin Franklin. NeilWell, you might be right, but you might not, we’ll find out at the end. I did like your use of ‘honestly’ there, Rob. We can use the adverb ‘honestly’ at the beginning of a sentence to show that we’re feeling irritated, for example when your co-presenter picks a quiz question that’s too easy! RobOK, OK, let’s move on now and hear from Philip Graves, a psychologist, and author of the book Consumerology, who can tell us about why honesty isn’t always the best policy. Philip Graves, Psychologist and author of the book ConsumerologyThe question is not ‘Are most consumers honest, the question is ‘Are most people honest?’, And the answer to that is ‘no’. We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest. It’s part of our evolutionary psychological make up, because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us, we have a greater chance of surviving. Now what’s important in that is that we also benefited from being in a social group and that was important in our evolutionary past so there is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can feather our own nest, so to speak, and the risk of being ostracised by the group. NeilA consumer is a person who buys things or services, for example, food or clothes. RobOr the use of a parking space, or a taxi. NeilNow, if I park my car and don’t pay for the parking space, I’m being dishonest, but I’m also saving money. RobAnd Philip Graves says being dishonest is part of our ‘psychological make up’. What does that mean? NeilOur psychological make up is the way the human mind works, the way we think. RobAnd it makes sense to be dishonest if you gain an advantage through this behaviour. So when you take something without paying for it, you save money you can spend on something else. NeilSo why do we place such importance on being honest then?, If we benefit from being dishonest? RobBecause it’s selfish behaviour, which other members of our social group won’t like. If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time, the world would be a very unpleasant place! NeilSelfish, meaning only caring about yourself and not about other people. That’s a good point, Rob. RobYes, societies work better if people behave co-operatively, which means working together towards shared goals. NeilSo honesty really is the best policy then, at least most of the time! DanAnd now it’s time for the answer to the quiz. Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’? NeilWhat do you think, Rob? RobOK. Was it Benjamin Franklin? NeilAnd that was the right answer! Maybe the question was too easy! Benjamin Franklin wrote it in a book of proverbs called Poor Richard’s Almanac between 1732 and 1758. Other famous quotes include ‘There are no gains without pains’ and ‘Have you something to do tomorrow? Do it today.’ OK let’s follow Franklin’s wise words and move right ahead with the vocabulary items we learned today. RobFirst up was the adjective honest, meaning truthful and not trying to cheat people, For example, ‘Neil has a very honest face’. OK, then there’s um .. honesty and honestly the noun and adverb forms. For example, erm. NeilHonestly, Rob, hurry up and do the second item! RobOK, OK, I’m getting there! To cheat, means to behave dishonestly to get what you want. NeilMy granny always used to cheat in card games. It was so annoying! RobAnd I always used to cheat in spelling tests at school! NeilHow dishonest, Rob! OK, number three. Consumer, a person who buys goods or services for their own personal use. RobFor example, ‘I am a big consumer of chocolate bars’. NeilThat’s terrible English, Rob! How about, ‘We asked UK consumers how much money they spent on food every month’? RobOK, I agree that’s a better example. Anyway, I never consume chocolate. Number four! NeilPsychological make up, the way our minds work. The way we think. RobFor example, ‘He had the psychological make up of a serial killer.’ NeilThat’s nasty! Moving on, selfish, caring only about yourself and not other people. RobYou only made yourself a cup of tea, that was a selfish thing to do! NeilWhat? RobIt was just an example. You’re not selfish, Neil. You’re actually the most co-operative person I know, you’re happy to work with others towards a common goal. NeilNot selfish then? RobNever selfish. Always co-operative And honest too. NeilGreat. Now, I honestly recommend that listeners visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. RobYou can co-operate with other learners in your common goal of improving your English! Bye-bye! NeilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil, and joining me is Rob.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语，我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六个词汇。我是 Neil，加入我的是 罗伯。 Rob(罗伯)Hello there! And today we’ve got six minutes to talk about honesty and how honest people are, particularly when it comes to spending money. So Neil, what’s an ‘honesty box’?嗨，你好！今天我们有六分钟的时间来讨论诚实以及人们的诚实程度，尤其是在花钱方面。那么 Neil，什么是“诚实箱”？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it’s where you pay for something by putting money in a box, but it’s up to you to put in the right amount. A small business might use this method to take money for things like parking your car or buying a newspaper because it means you don’t need a sales assistant.嗯，这是你通过将钱放在盒子里来支付某物的地方，但这取决于你是否投入正确的金额。小企业可能会使用这种方法来收取停车或购买报纸等费用，因为这意味着您不需要销售助理。 Rob(罗伯)But that means people could take a newspaper or park their car without paying anything! An honesty box relies on people being honest. The adjective honest means truthful and not trying to cheat people.但这意味着人们可以拿报纸或停车而无需支付任何费用！诚实箱依赖于人们的诚实。形容词 honest 的意思是诚实，而不是试图欺骗人们。 Neil(尼尔)And the noun is honesty, the quality of being truthful. Have you ever cheated an honesty box, Rob?而这个名词是诚实，诚实的品质。你有没有骗过诚实箱，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)Absolutely not! I’ve never have!绝对不行！我从来没有过！ Neil(尼尔)Honestly?真诚地？ Rob(罗伯)Honestly! And to cheat, by the way, means to trick or deceive someone to get something you want. Honesty is the best policy, as they say真诚地！顺便说一句，to cheat 的意思是欺骗或欺骗某人以获得你想要的东西。正如他们所说，诚实是最好的政策 Neil(尼尔)Which of course leads us on to our quiz.这当然会引导我们进行我们的测验。 Dan(担)The 6 minute English quiz! Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’? Was it. a) Donald Trump b) Benjamin Franklin or c) Richard Nixon?6 分钟的英语测验！谁说“诚实是最好的政策”？是这样。a） 唐纳德·特朗普 b） 本杰明·富兰克林 或 c） 理查德·尼克松？ Rob(罗伯)Honestly, Neil! Everyone will know the answer to that.老实说，尼尔！每个人都会知道这个问题的答案。 Neil(尼尔)But do you know the answer to that, Rob?但是你知道这个问题的答案吗，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)Well, I’ll have an honest guess. I think it’s b) Benjamin Franklin.好吧，我有一个诚实的猜测。我认为是 b） 本杰明·富兰克林。 Neil(尼尔)Well, you might be right, but you might not, we’ll find out at the end. I did like your use of ‘honestly’ there, Rob. We can use the adverb ‘honestly’ at the beginning of a sentence to show that we’re feeling irritated, for example when your co-presenter picks a quiz question that’s too easy!好吧，你可能是对的，但你可能不是，我们最后会发现。我确实喜欢你在那里用的 ‘honestly’ ，罗伯。我们可以在句子的开头使用副词 ‘honestly’ 来表示我们感到烦躁，例如，当你的共同主持人选择一个太简单的测验问题时！ Rob(罗伯)OK, OK, let’s move on now and hear from Philip Graves, a psychologist, and author of the book Consumerology, who can tell us about why honesty isn’t always the best policy.好，好，现在让我们继续前进，听听心理学家、《消费者学》一书的作者菲利普·格雷夫斯 （Philip Graves） 的意见，他可以告诉我们为什么诚实并不总是最好的政策。 Philip Graves, Psychologist and author of the book Consumerology(菲利普·格雷夫斯（PhilipGraves），心理学家，《消费者学》一书的作者)The question is not ‘Are most consumers honest, the question is ‘Are most people honest?’, And the answer to that is ‘no’. We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest. It’s part of our evolutionary psychological make up, because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us, we have a greater chance of surviving. Now what’s important in that is that we also benefited from being in a social group and that was important in our evolutionary past so there is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can feather our own nest, so to speak, and the risk of being ostracised by the group.问题不是 “大多数消费者诚实吗”，问题是 “大多数人诚实吗”，答案是 “不”。我们已经进化到有能力不诚实。这是我们进化心理构成的一部分，因为如果我们能获得优于周围人的优势，我们就有更大的生存机会。现在重要的是，我们也从社会群体中受益，这在我们的进化历史中很重要，因此我们可以在多大程度上保护自己的巢穴和被群体排斥的风险之间取得平衡。 Neil(尼尔)A consumer is a person who buys things or services, for example, food or clothes.消费者是购买物品或服务（例如食物或衣服）的人。 Rob(罗伯)Or the use of a parking space, or a taxi.或者使用停车位或出租车。 Neil(尼尔)Now, if I park my car and don’t pay for the parking space, I’m being dishonest, but I’m also saving money.现在，如果我把车停好，不付停车位费，我就是不诚实的，但我也在省钱。 Rob(罗伯)And Philip Graves says being dishonest is part of our ‘psychological make up’. What does that mean?菲利普·格雷夫斯 （Philip Graves） 说，不诚实是我们“心理构成”的一部分。那是什么意思？ Neil(尼尔)Our psychological make up is the way the human mind works, the way we think.我们的心理构成是人类思维的运作方式，我们的思维方式。 Rob(罗伯)And it makes sense to be dishonest if you gain an advantage through this behaviour. So when you take something without paying for it, you save money you can spend on something else.如果你通过这种行为获得了优势，那么不诚实是有道理的。因此，当您不付费就拿走某样东西时，您可以节省可以花在其他事情上的钱。 Neil(尼尔)So why do we place such importance on being honest then?, If we benefit from being dishonest?那么，如果我们从不诚实中受益，为什么我们如此重视诚实呢？ Rob(罗伯)Because it’s selfish behaviour, which other members of our social group won’t like. If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time, the world would be a very unpleasant place!因为这是自私的行为，我们社会群体的其他成员不会喜欢。如果每个人都一直自私和不诚实地行事，世界将是一个非常不愉快的地方！ Neil(尼尔)Selfish, meaning only caring about yourself and not about other people. That’s a good point, Rob.自私，意味着只关心自己，不关心别人。这是一个很好的观点，罗伯。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, societies work better if people behave co-operatively, which means working together towards shared goals.是的，如果人们合作行事，社会就会更好地运作，这意味着为共同的目标共同努力。 Neil(尼尔)So honesty really is the best policy then, at least most of the time!所以诚实确实是最好的策略，至少在大多数时候是这样！ Dan(担)And now it’s time for the answer to the quiz. Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’?现在是测验答案的时候了。谁说“诚实是最好的政策”？ Neil(尼尔)What do you think, Rob?你怎么看，罗伯？ Rob(罗伯)OK. Was it Benjamin Franklin?好吧，是本杰明·富兰克林吗？ Neil(尼尔)And that was the right answer! Maybe the question was too easy! Benjamin Franklin wrote it in a book of proverbs called Poor Richard’s Almanac between 1732 and 1758. Other famous quotes include ‘There are no gains without pains’ and ‘Have you something to do tomorrow? Do it today.’ OK let’s follow Franklin’s wise words and move right ahead with the vocabulary items we learned today.这就是正确的答案！也许这个问题太简单了！本杰明·富兰克林 （Benjamin Franklin） 在 1732 年至 1758 年间在一本名为《穷理查德年鉴》（Poor Richard’s Almanac） 的谚语书中写下了这句话。其他著名的名言包括“没有痛苦就没有收获”和“你明天有事要做吗？今天就去做。好，让我们遵循富兰克林的睿智之言，继续我们今天学到的词汇项目。 Rob(罗伯)First up was the adjective honest, meaning truthful and not trying to cheat people, For example, ‘Neil has a very honest face’. OK, then there’s um .. honesty and honestly the noun and adverb forms. For example, erm.首先是形容词 honest，意思是诚实的，不想欺骗别人，例如，“Neil 有一张非常诚实的脸”。好的，然后是嗯……诚实和诚实地 名词和副词形式。例如，erm. Neil(尼尔)Honestly, Rob, hurry up and do the second item!老实说，罗伯，快点做第二项吧！ Rob(罗伯)OK, OK, I’m getting there! To cheat, means to behave dishonestly to get what you want.好，好，我快到了！To cheat，意思是为了得到你想要的东西而做出不诚实的行为。 Neil(尼尔)My granny always used to cheat in card games. It was so annoying!我奶奶以前总是在纸牌游戏中作弊。这太烦人了！ Rob(罗伯)And I always used to cheat in spelling tests at school!而且我以前总是在学校的拼写测试中作弊！ Neil(尼尔)How dishonest, Rob! OK, number three. Consumer, a person who buys goods or services for their own personal use.多么不诚实啊，罗伯！好的，第三点。消费者，购买商品或服务供自己个人使用的人。 Rob(罗伯)For example, ‘I am a big consumer of chocolate bars’.例如，“我是巧克力棒的大消费者”。 Neil(尼尔)That’s terrible English, Rob! How about, ‘We asked UK consumers how much money they spent on food every month’?这英语太糟糕了，罗伯！“我们问英国消费者他们每个月在食品上花了多少钱”怎么样？ Rob(罗伯)OK, I agree that’s a better example. Anyway, I never consume chocolate. Number four!好吧，我同意这是一个更好的例子。无论如何，我从不吃巧克力。第四名！ Neil(尼尔)Psychological make up, the way our minds work. The way we think.心理构成，我们思维的运作方式。我们的思维方式。 Rob(罗伯)For example, ‘He had the psychological make up of a serial killer.’例如，’他有连环杀手的心理构成。 Neil(尼尔)That’s nasty! Moving on, selfish, caring only about yourself and not other people.太讨厌了！继续前进，自私，只关心自己，不关心别人。 Rob(罗伯)You only made yourself a cup of tea, that was a selfish thing to do!你只是给自己泡了一杯茶，那是一件自私的事情！ Neil(尼尔)What?什么？ Rob(罗伯)It was just an example. You’re not selfish, Neil. You’re actually the most co-operative person I know, you’re happy to work with others towards a common goal.这只是一个例子。你不自私，尼尔。你实际上是我认识的最合作的人，你很乐意与他人一起朝着共同的目标努力。 Neil(尼尔)Not selfish then?那不是自私吗？ Rob(罗伯)Never selfish.

I’m Neil. DanAnd I’m Dan. NeilNow, Dan, have you ever wanted to become invisible? DanInvisible – impossible to see. Of course! Who hasn’t? NeilWell how about this: most of us think we are in fact invisible, at least some of the time… We’ll be looking at the ‘invisibility cloak illusion’ in this programme. DanFascinating. And in that phrase we heard our first three words. Invisibility – the state of being invisible. A cloak is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders. NeilAnd the third word in that phrase – an illusion – is something that seems real but isn’t. DanOK, question time. Which of these stories features an invisibility cloak? Is it… a) The Hobbit b) Harry Potter Or c) The Invisible Man NeilI know they are all connected to invisibility, but I’m gonna say…a) The Hobbit. DanOk – we’ll reveal the answer later on. Now, let’s hear more about this invisibility cloak illusion. What’s the theory, Neil? NeilRight – imagine you’re sitting in a crowded train. People are busy looking at phones and books, but they’re also looking at each other. DanThey’re ‘people-watching’, as we call it. Yes. Yes, I do that. I do it a lot, if I’m honest! NeilSo – where does the invisibility part come in? DanA team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this. Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University. What did the Yale team find? Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster UniversitySo this study, they asked people that, first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody, and how much they thought those people were observing them. And there was always a mismatch. People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them. DanSo, people think they observe others more than others watch them. Everyone thinks they aren’t observed very much - it’s almost as if they’re invisible to others – or wearing an invisibility cloak! NeilAnd the difference between how much they are actually being watched and think they’re being watched is what she called a mismatch. It’s the difference between two things – they’re two things which don’t ‘match’. DanIn other words – it’s not true that people aren’t watching us – which is why the idea of having an invisibility cloak is just an illusion. This next bit is interesting. Two people were asked to wait in a room. Then they were each asked to make two lists: one, what they noticed about the other person; and two, what they thought the other person noticed about them. NeilSo list one was always longer than list two. Not only that – but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists. DanLet’s hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday. What was the difference? Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster UniversityWhen people are observing you they’re doing it in a non-judgemental, fairly empathic way – and not actually noticing the things that you’re self-conscious about. So if for example you feel self-conscious about a spot on your nose, or something that you’re wearing, that won’t be what they’re noticing. It’s a much less judgemental form of observation. NeilRight, so even if we’re feeling self-conscious about something – that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves – maybe our appearance or our clothes – we needn’t be. DanYes, you don’t need to feel self-conscious. People aren’t being judgemental. NeilAnd being judgemental means being critical. DanThat’s good news. So even though all I’m thinking about is how badly I need a haircut, the other person is probably noticing something completely different. Back to the question about the invisibility cloak. Which story is it in? NeilI said The Hobbit. DanAnd it was in fact – Harry Potter. Not only does the garment make you impossible to see, it also protects you against magic spells. NeilWow – I need one of those! DanIn The Hobbit, it’s a ring that makes you invisible, and in The Invisible Man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect. NeilNow, before we become invisible ourselves, how about we go through today’s words? Dan Marvellous. First we had invisible – which means impossible to see. You could say that stars are invisible during the day. NeilThey’re only visible at night. DanWe also had cloak – who would wear a cloak? Maybe a king or a monk? Or maybe you, Neil? NeilI’m sure I could look good in a cloak – that’s a long piece of material worn over the shoulders. What about illusion? DanIllusions appear to be true, but they’re not. It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the illusion that everything he says is true. Then we had mismatch – which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there’s a mismatch between what Michael says and what he does. NeilWho’s Michael? DanJust an example! You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple – they seem very different – they’re a bit of a mismatch. NeilWhat is it with you and Michael?! One, he doesn’t exist, and two, I think you’re being judgemental. DanWell, I’m criticising him so, yeah, you’re right – I’m being judgemental. Perhaps I should stop. It’s just that… it’s just that I’m in love with Simone myself, and I get all nervous and self-conscious when I see her. NeilYou mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you – you become self- conscious? DanI do. NeilEven though she doesn’t exist either? DanWell, only in my examples. Sometimes I wish I really did have an invisibility cloak. NeilHey, hang on, Dan - where have you gone? DanHaha – very funny, I’m still perfectly visible. Time to go – but do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website! NeilGoodbye for now. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six items of useful vocabulary. I’m Neil.欢迎来到六分钟英语，在这个节目中，我们将探索一个有趣的话题，并为您带来六项有用的词汇。我是 Neil。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan.我是 Dan。 Neil(尼尔)Now, Dan, have you ever wanted to become invisible?现在，Dan，你有没有想过变得隐形？ Dan(担)Invisible – impossible to see. Of course! Who hasn’t?看不见 – 看不见。答案是肯定的！谁没有呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well how about this: most of us think we are in fact invisible, at least some of the time… We’ll be looking at the ‘invisibility cloak illusion’ in this programme.那么，我们大多数人认为我们实际上是隐形的，至少在某些时候是这样……我们将在此计划中研究“隐形斗篷幻觉”。 Dan(担)Fascinating. And in that phrase we heard our first three words. Invisibility – the state of being invisible. A cloak is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders.迷人。在那句话中，我们听到了前三个字。隐身 – 不可见的状态。斗篷是一块长长的材料，像外套一样披在肩膀上。 Neil(尼尔)And the third word in that phrase – an illusion – is something that seems real but isn’t.而这句话中的第三个词 – 幻觉 – 是看似真实但并非如此的东西。 Dan(担)OK, question time. Which of these stories features an invisibility cloak? Is it… a) The Hobbit b) Harry Potter Or c) The Invisible Man好的，提问时间。这些故事中哪一个有隐形斗篷？是吗。。。a） 霍比特人 b） 哈利波特 或 c） 隐形人 Neil(尼尔)I know they are all connected to invisibility, but I’m gonna say…a) The Hobbit.我知道他们都与隐身有关，但我要说……a） 霍比特人。 Dan(担)Ok – we’ll reveal the answer later on. Now, let’s hear more about this invisibility cloak illusion. What’s the theory, Neil?好的 – 我们稍后会揭示答案。现在，让我们更多地了解这种隐形斗篷幻觉。理论是什么，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Right – imagine you’re sitting in a crowded train. People are busy looking at phones and books, but they’re also looking at each other.对 - 想象一下你坐在一辆拥挤的火车上。人们忙着看手机和书籍，但他们也在看着彼此。 Dan(担)They’re ‘people-watching’, as we call it. Yes. Yes, I do that. I do it a lot, if I’m honest!正如我们所说的，他们是 “观察人群”。是的。是的，我这样做。老实说，我经常这样做！ Neil(尼尔)So – where does the invisibility part come in?那么 - 隐形部分从何而来？ Dan(担)A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this. Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University. What did the Yale team find?耶鲁大学的一组科学家对此做了一些实验。威斯敏斯特大学的神经科学家 Catherine Loveday 博士在这里评论了这项研究。耶鲁大学团队发现了什么？ Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University(CatherineLoveday博士，威斯敏斯特大学神经科学家)So this study, they asked people that, first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody, and how much they thought those people were observing them. And there was always a mismatch. People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them.所以在这项研究中，他们问人们，首先他们做了一项调查，然后问坐在食堂里的人他们观察了多少人，以及他们认为这些人观察了多少。而且总是有不匹配的情况。人们总是认为他们比观察他们的人更善于观察。 Dan(担)So, people think they observe others more than others watch them. Everyone thinks they aren’t observed very much - it’s almost as if they’re invisible to others – or wearing an invisibility cloak!因此，人们认为他们观察他人的次数多于观察他人的次数。每个人都认为他们没有被太多观察 - 几乎就像他们被别人看不见一样 - 或者穿着隐形斗篷！ Neil(尼尔)And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and think they’re being watched is what she called a mismatch. It’s the difference between two things – they’re two things which don’t ‘match’.他们实际被监视的程度与认为他们被监视的程度之间的差异就是她所说的不匹配。这是两件事之间的区别 —— 它们是两件不 “匹配 ”的事情。 Dan(担)In other words – it’s not true that people aren’t watching us – which is why the idea of having an invisibility cloak is just an illusion. This next bit is interesting. Two people were asked to wait in a room. Then they were each asked to make two lists: one, what they noticed about the other person; and two, what they thought the other person noticed about them.换句话说 —— 人们不看着我们是不是真的 —— 这就是为什么拥有隐形斗篷的想法只是一种幻觉。接下来的一点很有趣。两个人被要求在一个房间里等待。然后他们每个人都被要求列出两个清单：一个，他们注意到了另一个人的情况；第二，他们认为对方注意到了他们。 Neil(尼尔)So list one was always longer than list two. Not only that – but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists.所以清单 1 总是比清单 2 长。不仅如此 - 而且列表的内容也存在重要差异。 Dan(担)Let’s hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday. What was the difference?让我们再次聆听神经科学家 Catherine Loveday 博士的发言。有什么区别呢？ Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University(CatherineLoveday博士，威斯敏斯特大学神经科学家)When people are observing you they’re doing it in a non-judgemental, fairly empathic way – and not actually noticing the things that you’re self-conscious about. So if for example you feel self-conscious about a spot on your nose, or something that you’re wearing, that won’t be what they’re noticing. It’s a much less judgemental form of observation.当人们观察你时，他们是在以一种非评判、相当同理心的方式进行 —— 实际上并没有注意到你自我意识所做的事情。因此，例如，如果您对鼻子上的某个斑点或您佩戴的东西感到不自在，那他们就不会注意到。这是一种不那么评判性的观察形式。 Neil(尼尔)Right, so even if we’re feeling self-conscious about something – that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves – maybe our appearance or our clothes – we needn’t be.是的，所以即使我们对某件事感到不自在 —— 这意味着对自己的某个方面感到格外了解 —— 也许是我们的外表或我们的衣服 —— 我们不需要如此。 Dan(担)Yes, you don’t need to feel self-conscious. People aren’t being judgemental.是的，你不需要感到自我意识。人们不是在评判。 Neil(尼尔)And being judgemental means being critical.评判意味着批评。 Dan(担)That’s good news. So even though all I’m thinking about is how badly I need a haircut, the other person is probably noticing something completely different. Back to the question about the invisibility cloak. Which story is it in?这是个好消息。因此，即使我所想的只是我多么需要理发，但对方可能注意到了完全不同的东西。回到关于隐形斗篷的问题。它位于哪个故事中？ Neil(尼尔)I said The Hobbit.我说的是《霍比特人》。 Dan(担)And it was in fact – Harry Potter. Not only does the garment make you impossible to see, it also protects you against magic spells.事实上，它就是 —— 哈利波特。这件衣服不仅让您无法被看到，还可以保护您免受魔法咒语的侵害。 Neil(尼尔)Wow – I need one of those!哇 - 我需要其中之一！ Dan(担)In The Hobbit, it’s a ring that makes you invisible, and in The Invisible Man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect.在《霍比特人》中，它是一个让你隐形的戒指，而在《隐形人》中，主角使用化学物质来达到同样的效果。 Neil(尼尔)Now, before we become invisible ourselves, how about we go through today’s words? Dan Marvellous. First we had invisible – which means impossible to see. You could say that stars are invisible during the day.现在，在我们自己变得隐形之前，我们先回顾一下今天的文字怎么样？丹·了不起。首先，我们有 Invisible – 这意味着不可能看到。你可以说星星在白天是看不见的。 Neil(尼尔)They’re only visible at night.它们只在晚上可见。 Dan(担)We also had cloak – who would wear a cloak? Maybe a king or a monk? Or maybe you, Neil?我们还有斗篷 —— 谁会穿斗篷呢？也许是国王或僧侣？或者你，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)I’m sure I could look good in a cloak – that’s a long piece of material worn over the shoulders. What about illusion?我敢肯定我穿斗篷会很好看 —— 那是一件披在肩上的长材料。幻觉呢？ Dan(担)Illusions appear to be true, but they’re not. It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the illusion that everything he says is true. Then we had mismatch – which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there’s a mismatch between what Michael says and what he does.幻觉似乎是真的，但事实并非如此。它可以描述一个想法：你可以说一个政治家有一种错觉，认为他所说的一切都是真的。然后我们遇到了不匹配 —— 这可以指两件事之间的差异，也许应该相似：Michael 所说和他所做的事情之间存在不匹配。 Neil(尼尔)Who’s Michael?迈克尔是谁？ Dan(担)Just an example! You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple – they seem very different – they’re a bit of a mismatch.只是一个例子！你也可以说 Michael 和 Simone 是一对不太可能的夫妇 —— 他们看起来非常不同 —— 他们有点不匹配。 Neil(尼尔)What is it with you and Michael?! One, he doesn’t exist, and two, I think you’re being judgemental.你和迈克尔怎么了？！第一，他不存在，第二，我认为你在评判。 Dan(担)Well, I’m criticising him so, yeah, you’re right – I’m being judgemental. Perhaps I should stop. It’s just that… it’s just that I’m in love with Simone myself, and I get all nervous and self-conscious when I see her.嗯，我批评他，所以，是的，你是对的 —— 我是在评判。也许我应该停下来。只是。。。只是我自己也爱上了 Simone，当我看到她时，我会感到紧张和不自在。 Neil(尼尔)You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you – you become self- conscious?你的意思是你对她可能会怎么看你感到尴尬 —— 你变得自我意识？ Dan(担)I do.我愿意。 Neil(尼尔)Even though she doesn’t exist either?即使她也不存在？ Dan(担)Well, only in my examples. Sometimes I wish I really did have an invisibility cloak.嗯，只是在我的例子中。有时我希望我真的有一件隐形斗篷。 Neil(尼尔)Hey, hang on, Dan - where have you gone?嘿，等等，Dan - 你去哪儿了？ Dan(担)Haha – very funny, I’m still perfectly visible. Time to go – but do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!哈哈 – 非常有趣，我仍然非常明显。是时候走了 - 但请访问我们的 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 页面，当然还有我们的网站！ Neil(尼尔)Goodbye for now.现在再见。 Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】invisibleimpossible to be seen隐形的不可能被看到的The satellites are virtually invisible to the naked eye.这些卫星实际上肉眼是看不到的。 cloaka long piece of material worn over the shoulders like a coat斗篷披风；宽大外衣The hills wore a cloak of deep green.群山笼罩在一片深绿色之中。 illusionsomething which appears real but isn’t假象看起来真实但并非真实的事物The impression of depth is an optical illusion.深度感是一种光学错觉。 mismatchdifference between two things; a bad combination不匹配两个事物之间的差异；糟糕的组合There is often a mismatch between the skills employers require and those which graduates possess.雇主所需技能和毕业生所掌握技能之间常常存在不匹配。 judgementalcritical爱评判的爱挑剔的You must try not to be so judgemental about people.你必须尽量避免对他人评头论足。 self-conscioustoo aware of yourself; embarrassed what others think about you不自在的过于关注自己；因别人对你的看法而感到尴尬He looked uncomfortable and a little self-conscious.他看起来不舒服，而且有点不自在。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】迷路的猫狗如何找到回家的路？","path":"/2017/07/13/wechat-2017-07-13/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilWelcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases. I’m Neil. DanAnd I’m Dan. Today we’re talking about one of the last mysteries of science. No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances? NeilWe hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home – but scientists struggle to explain how they do it. DanWe’ll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that – I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you a cat person or a dog person? NeilOh, that’s easy – I’m a cat person, for sure. Dogs are just a… well, they are hard work, aren’t they? DanIf you say you are ‘a cat person’ it means you prefer cats. ‘A coffee person’ prefers coffee. A ‘something’ person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing. NeilBack to the topic, I’m a cat person. But can you answer this, Dan? Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world’s longest cat. How long is Omar? Is it… a) 120 cm b) 80 cm Or c) 180 cm DanI’m gonna say c) 180 cm. NeilNow, from long cats to long-distance cats. Scientists were scratching their heads a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home. How did it do it? DanWe say you ‘scratch your head’ when you are confused about something. There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate – but we don’t yet have the full answer. NeilWell, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts – they let you know where you are. Visual landmarks also play a role, just as they do with humans. A landmark is something very easily recognised – a big building or mountain for example. DanAnd what about this one: magnets are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a magnetic force. NeilBirds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles – it tells them where north is. It’s thought they have some iron in their beaks. DanBut some scientists think mammals also have this capability. NeilSo we have a few ideas – smell, landmarks, magnetic forces – but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home? DanLet’s hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads? Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of BristolWhat they do when they are in a new territory is explore it in a very systematic way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they’ll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that’s lost its territory probably does the same thing. They’ll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they’ll either come across the territory or they’ll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home. DanCats have a systematic approach – which means they use a system. Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one – until they have a strong mental map of the place. NeilYes – a mental map is a map in your head – stored in your memory. And the area cats explore – their home area - is called their territory. Cats are territorial – which means their territory is very important to them. DanHaving a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue – which is a landmark or a smell – that tells it where it is. Well, that’s the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don’t have enough data – that’s enough information about this. NeilWhen there is a scientific breakthrough - we’ll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope. For now, let’s content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world’s longest cat. How long, Dan? DanI said 180 cm. NeilOmar measures 120 cm – that’s over two thirds of my height – and weighs a heavy 14 kg. DanWell, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he’d be found in no time. NeilHe’s a landmark in himself! Which reminds me – let’s run through today’s words again. If you’re a cat person, you prefer cats. If you’re an evening person – you prefer evenings. DanI’ve always thought you were a kind person, Neil. NeilNice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives! DanIndeed. We don’t want the listeners to be scratching their heads. NeilNo, we can’t confuse them! So let’s explain the next one clearly – a landmark is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are. The bridges in London are landmarks. DanAnd can we say the parks are magnets in summer? A magnet is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel – but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: territory is a noun – the area of land that an animal considers to be its own. NeilAnimals who feel this strongly are described as territorial. Humans can be too – about land or subjects they feel they own or control. DanAnd finally systematic: the adjective from system. We can talk about a systematic approach, a systematic solution, a systematic study… NeilAnd we have systematically worked our way through all of today’s words! DanVery good! Which means – it’s time mention our own online territory – our website and social media pages. NeilCheck us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course bbclearningenglish.com! DanBye bye for now. NeilGoodbye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases. I’m Neil.欢迎来到六分钟英语，我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六个有用的单词或短语。我是 Neil。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan. Today we’re talking about one of the last mysteries of science. No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?我是 Dan。今天我们谈论的是科学的最后一个谜团。不，不是宇宙会永远膨胀，而是：猫和狗是如何长途跋涉找到回家的路的？ Neil(尼尔)We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home – but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.我们听说过走失的宠物长途跋涉数十英里甚至数百英里回家的令人难以置信的故事 —— 但科学家们很难解释他们是如何做到的。 Dan(担)We’ll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that – I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you a cat person or a dog person?我们今天将听到一位科学家的观点。但在此之前 —— 我必须问一个重要的问题：Neil，你是爱猫还是爱狗？ Neil(尼尔)Oh, that’s easy – I’m a cat person, for sure. Dogs are just a… well, they are hard work, aren’t they?哦，这很容易 —— 我肯定是一个喜欢猫的人。狗只是一种……嗯，他们很辛苦，不是吗？ Dan(担)If you say you are ‘a cat person’ it means you prefer cats. ‘A coffee person’ prefers coffee. A ‘something’ person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing.如果你说你是 “爱猫的人”，那就意味着你更喜欢猫。“咖啡人”更喜欢咖啡。一个 “某物 ”的人喜欢或更喜欢那件事，通常是而不是另一件事。 Neil(尼尔)Back to the topic, I’m a cat person. But can you answer this, Dan? Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world’s longest cat. How long is Omar? Is it… a) 120 cm b) 80 cm Or c) 180 cm回到主题，我是一个爱猫的人。但你能回答这个问题吗，Dan？最近，一只名叫 Omar 的猫成为头条新闻，因为它可能是世界上最长的猫。奥马尔多长时间？是吗。。。a） 120 厘米 b） 80 厘米 或 c） 180 厘米 Dan(担)I’m gonna say c) 180 cm.我要说 c） 180 厘米。 Neil(尼尔)Now, from long cats to long-distance cats. Scientists were scratching their heads a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home. How did it do it?现在，从长猫到远距离猫。几年前，一只名叫 Holly 的迷路猫走了 200 英里才回家，科学家们们都在摸不着头脑。它是怎么做到的呢？ Dan(担)We say you ‘scratch your head’ when you are confused about something. There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate – but we don’t yet have the full answer.我们说，当你对某件事感到困惑时，你会 “挠头”。关于猫和狗如何导航，有一些理论 —— 但我们还没有完整的答案。 Neil(尼尔)Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts – they let you know where you are. Visual landmarks also play a role, just as they do with humans. A landmark is something very easily recognised – a big building or mountain for example.嗯，当然，猫和狗都有非常强大的嗅觉。气味就像路标 —— 它们让您知道自己在哪里。视觉地标也发挥着作用，就像它们对人类的作用一样。地标是很容易识别的东西 —— 例如一座大建筑或山脉。 Dan(担)And what about this one: magnets are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a magnetic force.那么这个呢：磁铁是吸引某些其他种类金属（例如铁或钢）的金属片。地球本身就有磁力。 Neil(尼尔)Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles – it tells them where north is. It’s thought they have some iron in their beaks.鸟类用它来帮助他们导航数千英里 —— 它告诉它们北方在哪里。人们认为它们的喙里有一些铁。 Dan(担)But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.但一些科学家认为哺乳动物也具有这种能力。 Neil(尼尔)So we have a few ideas – smell, landmarks, magnetic forces – but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?所以我们有一些想法 —— 气味、地标、磁力 —— 但我们能解释一下一只小猫是如何独自旅行 200 多英里回到它的家的吗？ Dan(担)Let’s hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?让我们听听猫狗专家 John Bradshaw 博士的意见。猫是如何在脑海中构建地图的？ Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol(JohnBradshaw博士，布里斯托大学兽医科学学院)What they do when they are in a new territory is explore it in a very systematic way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they’ll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that’s lost its territory probably does the same thing. They’ll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they’ll either come across the territory or they’ll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home.当他们进入一个新的领域时，他们所做的就是以非常系统的方式探索它。所以他们会在不断扩大的圈子里出去，他们真的会在脑海中构建一张心理地图。因此，一只失去领地的猫可能会做同样的事情。他们会依赖这样的想法，如果他们以越来越大的圆圈或矩形出去，那么最终他们要么穿过这片领土，要么他们会遇到他们曾经居住的领土上随风飘来的气味，然后能够回家。 Dan(担)Cats have a systematic approach – which means they use a system. Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one – until they have a strong mental map of the place.猫有一个系统的方法 —— 这意味着它们使用一个系统。也就是说：首先他们在自己的区域围成一个小圆圈，然后是一个更大的圆圈，然后是一个更大的圆圈 —— 直到他们对这个地方有一个强大的心理地图。 Neil(尼尔)Yes – a mental map is a map in your head – stored in your memory. And the area cats explore – their home area - is called their territory. Cats are territorial – which means their territory is very important to them.是的 – 心理地图是您脑海中的地图 – 存储在您的记忆中。猫咪探索的区域 —— 它们的家乡 —— 被称为它们的领地。猫是有领地意识的 —— 这意味着它们的领地对它们来说非常重要。 Dan(担)Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue – which is a landmark or a smell – that tells it where it is. Well, that’s the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don’t have enough data – that’s enough information about this.拥有地图固然很好，但猫迷路时会发生什么呢？布拉德肖博士说，它再次以越来越大的圆圈移动，直到找到一条线索 —— 一个地标或一种气味 —— 告诉它它在哪里。嗯，这就是理论。尽管 Bradshaw 博士说我们仍然没有足够的数据 —— 但这已经足够了。 Neil(尼尔)When there is a scientific breakthrough - we’ll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope. For now, let’s content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world’s longest cat. How long, Dan?当有科学突破时 - 我希望我们会以六分钟英语的形式为您带来。现在，让我们对 Omar 感到满意，这可能是世界上最长的猫。多长时间，丹？ Dan(担)I said 180 cm.我说的是 180 厘米。 Neil(尼尔)Omar measures 120 cm – that’s over two thirds of my height – and weighs a heavy 14 kg.Omar 身高 120 厘米，超过我身高的三分之二，体重达 14 公斤。 Dan(担)Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he’d be found in no time.嗯，有一件事，尼尔，如果奥马尔迷路了，他很快就会被找到。 Neil(尼尔)He’s a landmark in himself! Which reminds me – let’s run through today’s words again. If you’re a cat person, you prefer cats. If you’re an evening person – you prefer evenings.他本身就是一个里程碑！这让我想起了 —— 让我们再来一遍今天的文字。如果你是一个爱猫的人，你更喜欢猫。如果你喜欢晚上 - 你更喜欢晚上。 Dan(担)I’ve always thought you were a kind person, Neil.我一直觉得你是个善良的人，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives!你说得不错，但我们只使用带有名词的短语，而不是形容词！ Dan(担)Indeed. We don’t want the listeners to be scratching their heads.事实上。我们不希望听众摸不着头脑。 Neil(尼尔)No, we can’t confuse them! So let’s explain the next one clearly – a landmark is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are. The bridges in London are landmarks.不，我们不能混淆他们！因此，让我们清楚地解释下一个 – 地标是易于识别的东西，可以让您知道自己在哪里。伦敦的桥梁是地标。 Dan(担)And can we say the parks are magnets in summer? A magnet is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel – but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: territory is a noun – the area of land that an animal considers to be its own.我们能说公园在夏天是磁铁吗？磁铁是一块吸引钢铁的金属 —— 但我们也可以更广泛地使用这个词来描述吸引其他事物的事物。再说两个词：territory 是一个名词 —— 动物认为是自己的土地面积。 Neil(尼尔)Animals who feel this strongly are described as territorial. Humans can be too – about land or subjects they feel they own or control.强烈感受到这一点的动物被描述为领地动物。人类也可以 —— 关于他们认为自己拥有或控制的土地或主体。 Dan(担)And finally systematic: the adjective from system. We can talk about a systematic approach, a systematic solution, a systematic study…最后是系统性的：来自系统的形容词。我们可以谈论一种系统的方法、一个系统的解决方案、一个系统的研究…… Neil(尼尔)And we have systematically worked our way through all of today’s words!我们已经系统地完成了今天的所有单词！ Dan(担)Very good! Which means – it’s time mention our own online territory – our website and social media pages.非常好！这意味着 - 是时候提及我们自己的在线领域 - 我们的网站和社交媒体页面了。 Neil(尼尔)Check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course bbclearningenglish.com!在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上关注我们，当然还有 bbclearningenglish.com！ Dan(担)Bye bye for now.再见。 Neil(尼尔)Goodbye!再见！ 【核心词汇】a (cat) personsomeone who likes or prefers (cats)爱猫人士喜欢猫的人I’m not really a cat person, to be honest.说实话，我不太喜欢猫。 to scratch your head (about something)to be confused (about something)挠头；困惑感到困惑I was scratching my head about how to get out of the difficulty.我正在为如何摆脱困境而挠头。 landmarksomething which is easily recognisable and helps you find your way地标容易辨认且能帮助你找到方向的事物The Empire State Building is a familiar landmark in New York.帝国大厦是纽约一个熟悉的地标。 magneta piece of metal which attracts certain metals磁铁能吸引某些金属的金属块The fridge door is held shut by a magnet.冰箱门是用磁铁关上的。 systematicdone according to a system有系统的按系统进行的They went about their business in a systematic way.他们以系统的方式处理业务。 territorythe area an animal controls领地动物控制的区域Male birds sing to defend their territory.雄鸟唱歌是为了保卫自己的领地。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】想改善你的生活吗？","path":"/2017/07/06/wechat-2017-07-06/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilWelcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil, and today we’re going to improve ourselves. RobHaha, how could we possibly get any better? I’m Rob, and yes, today’s topic is self-help – and the self-help industry. NeilWhat do we mean by self-help? Well, it means trying to improve yourself – psychologically, economically or in other ways – without seeking official help. RobFor example, bookshops these days are full of titles which claim to boost your self- confidence, your wealth, your love life… or your career! NeilYes, in just seven days! There’s a clear demand for this kind of thing – the self-help industry is worth $10bn in the US alone. RobThat’s a lot. That includes things like gym memberships, diet plans and life coaching apps. NeilWe’ll be looking at why. But first, the self-help industry has been around for a long time. Which of these well-known books was published first? a) How to Win Friends and Influence People b) Think and Grow Rich c) The Law of Attraction RobMmm. I could do with some help here. I’ll go with the first one – How to Win Friends and Influence People. NeilOK, well before we go further, let’s take a trip inside a bookshop in Manchester to find out which self-help books are selling well. RobLet’s listen to Emma Marshall, a manager at Waterstones bookshop. What’s popular now? Emma Marshall, Assistant Manager, WaterstonesAt the moment we’re in the tidying up, getting rid of things trend. But before that we saw colouring in, which became a huge thing. It’s kind of dwindling now, because these sorts of trends come in and then they go. Like last year we saw ‘hygge’, which is the Danish art of living well, apparently. So we’re taking from all sorts of cultures. And so I think the trend right now is about slowing down in your life. NeilEmma says there are a couple of trends right now. A trend, here, means something new which is popular for a period of time. RobYes, so she mentioned tidying up and getting rid of things. Would you buy a book about tidying up, Neil? NeilI’d be more likely to buy a book about it than actually tidy up! She also mentioned a current trend about slowing down in our lives. RobI can agree with that! And previous trends included colouring-in – these books have black and white outline pictures that you fill in with colours. NeilI used to do that as a child. Very therapeutic! RobTherapeutic – making you feel more relaxed and less anxious – it’s related to the word therapy… NeilAlthough the colouring-in trend is dwindling - it’s becoming weaker. They’re selling fewer colouring-in books. RobSo – trends come and go, but the industry is going from strength to strength. NeilTo go from strength to strength means to remain strong, or get even stronger! Why? RobDr Jennifer Wild, a psychologist from Oxford University, believes that the internet is a big factor. NeilWe’ve got used to searching for solutions online, and now these solutions even include how to fix or improve our lives. RobAnd psychologist Caroline Beaton, writing on Forbes.com, said she believes that millennials are a big factor. NeilHow do we define the term ‘millennial’? Also known as Generation Y – are people born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. It’s a common term in the news – often because people born in this time in the West are seen to have certain characteristics. RobThey’re sometimes described as lazy and obsessed with themselves – and while that’s not necessarily true, Caroline Beaton says millennials are highly self-critical. NeilSelf-critical – they are aware of their own faults – which also means they’re more likely to spend time on money on self-help. She says they spend twice as much as Generation Xers. Generation X refers to people born between the late 60s and around 1980. RobAnd one more possible reason why the self-help industry does well: it’s very resistant to recessions. When the economy does badly – as we say it goes into recession – people are perhaps even more likely to reach for self-help to improve their situation. NeilSo there we are. Now, let’s go back to another recession – the Great Depression of the 1930s in America – and to my question about which self-help book was published first? RobWell – I said a) How to Win Friends and Influence People. NeilIn fact – two of these books were published in the late 1930s, How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie, was first in 1936. It has since sold over 30 million copies. Think and grow rich, by Napoleon Hill, was published in 1937, and is believed to have sold over 100 million copies! RobThat’s a lot of self-help. Wow – have you read either of them? NeilI haven’t read either of them but, perhaps, I should RobWell, before we rush home and improve ourselves, let’s improve our vocabularies. NeilOf course – today we had: self-help - the activity of improving yourself – physically, mentally or in other ways – often through courses and books. RobThere are lots of trends in the self-help industry. And we also see trends in fashion, in music, in popular culture… Like the trend for men to grow beards. NeilAre you talking about me? Anyway, I think the beard trend is dwindling. It’s getting smaller, less influential. RobReally? I stroke my beard here. I think it’s very therapeutic. It makes me relax and feel good. NeilMaybe you’re right. What about our next phrase – to go from strength to strength? RobYou could say a business is going from strength to strength if it’s earning a lot of money. NeilIndeed. And what about our term for young people – millennial. Are you a millennial, Rob? RobDidn’t quite scraped in there. I’m still a Generation X. But I do like to think I’m in touch with what millennials do. Which includes – having lots of different social media accounts. NeilJust like us – do look up BBC Learning English on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. RobAnd good luck with your self-improvement! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Neil, and today we’re going to improve ourselves.欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Neil，今天我们要提高自己。 Rob(罗伯)Haha, how could we possibly get any better? I’m Rob, and yes, today’s topic is self-help – and the self-help industry.哈哈，我们怎么可能变得更好呢？我是 罗伯，是的，今天的主题是自助 - 以及自助行业。 Neil(尼尔)What do we mean by self-help? Well, it means trying to improve yourself – psychologically, economically or in other ways – without seeking official help.我们所说的自助是什么意思？嗯，这意味着尝试在心理上、经济上或其他方面提高自己，而不寻求官方帮助。 Rob(罗伯)For example, bookshops these days are full of titles which claim to boost your self- confidence, your wealth, your love life… or your career!例如，如今的书店里到处都是声称可以提高你的自信、财富、爱情生活的书……或者你的职业生涯！ Neil(尼尔)Yes, in just seven days! There’s a clear demand for this kind of thing – the self-help industry is worth $10bn in the US alone.是的，仅用了 7 天！对这种东西的需求是明显的 —— 仅在美国，自助行业就价值 100 亿美元。 Rob(罗伯)That’s a lot. That includes things like gym memberships, diet plans and life coaching apps.这很多。这包括健身房会员资格、饮食计划和生活教练应用程序等。 Neil(尼尔)We’ll be looking at why. But first, the self-help industry has been around for a long time. Which of these well-known books was published first? a) How to Win Friends and Influence People b) Think and Grow Rich c) The Law of Attraction我们将看看原因。但首先，自助行业已经存在了很长时间。这些知名书籍中哪一本是先出版的？a） 如何赢得朋友和影响他人 b） 思考并致富 c） 吸引力法则 Rob(罗伯)Mmm. I could do with some help here. I’ll go with the first one – How to Win Friends and Influence People.嗯，我可以在这里帮忙。我将选择第一个 – 如何赢得朋友和影响他人。 Neil(尼尔)OK, well before we go further, let’s take a trip inside a bookshop in Manchester to find out which self-help books are selling well.好的，在我们进一步讨论之前，让我们走进曼彻斯特的一家书店，看看哪些自助书籍卖得好。 Rob(罗伯)Let’s listen to Emma Marshall, a manager at Waterstones bookshop. What’s popular now?让我们听听 Waterstones 书店的经理 Emma Marshall 的话。现在流行什么？ Emma Marshall, Assistant Manager, Waterstones(EmmaMarshall，Waterstones助理经理)At the moment we’re in the tidying up, getting rid of things trend. But before that we saw colouring in, which became a huge thing. It’s kind of dwindling now, because these sorts of trends come in and then they go. Like last year we saw ‘hygge’, which is the Danish art of living well, apparently. So we’re taking from all sorts of cultures. And so I think the trend right now is about slowing down in your life.目前，我们正处于整理、摆脱事物的趋势中。但在那之前，我们看到了着色，这成为一件大事。现在它有点减少，因为这些趋势来了又走了。和去年一样，我们看到了“hygge”，这显然是丹麦人追求美好生活的艺术。所以我们从各种文化中汲取灵感。所以我认为现在的趋势是放慢你的生活。 Neil(尼尔)Emma says there are a couple of trends right now. A trend, here, means something new which is popular for a period of time.Emma 说，现在有几个趋势。这里的趋势是指在一段时间内流行的新事物。 Rob(罗伯)Yes, so she mentioned tidying up and getting rid of things. Would you buy a book about tidying up, Neil?是的，所以她提到了整理和扔掉东西。你会买一本关于整理的书吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)I’d be more likely to buy a book about it than actually tidy up! She also mentioned a current trend about slowing down in our lives.我更有可能买一本关于它的书，而不是真正整理！她还提到了我们生活中放慢脚步的当前趋势。 Rob(罗伯)I can agree with that! And previous trends included colouring-in – these books have black and white outline pictures that you fill in with colours.我同意这一点！以前的趋势包括填色 —— 这些书有黑白轮廓图片，你可以用颜色填充。 Neil(尼尔)I used to do that as a child. Very therapeutic!我小时候曾经这样做过。非常有治疗作用！ Rob(罗伯)Therapeutic – making you feel more relaxed and less anxious – it’s related to the word therapy…治疗性 – 让您感觉更放松，不那么焦虑 – 它与 therapy 这个词有关…… Neil(尼尔)Although the colouring-in trend is dwindling - it’s becoming weaker. They’re selling fewer colouring-in books.尽管着色趋势正在减少 - 但它变得越来越弱。他们卖的填色书越来越少。 Rob(罗伯)So – trends come and go, but the industry is going from strength to strength.所以 - 趋势来来去去，但这个行业正在不断发展壮大。 Neil(尼尔)To go from strength to strength means to remain strong, or get even stronger! Why?To go more to strong 的意思是保持强大，或者变得更强大！为什么？ Rob(罗伯)Dr Jennifer Wild, a psychologist from Oxford University, believes that the internet is a big factor.牛津大学的心理学家詹妮弗·怀尔德博士认为，互联网是一个重要因素。 Neil(尼尔)We’ve got used to searching for solutions online, and now these solutions even include how to fix or improve our lives.我们已经习惯于在网上寻找解决方案，现在这些解决方案甚至包括如何修复或改善我们的生活。 Rob(罗伯)And psychologist Caroline Beaton, writing on Forbes.com, said she believes that millennials are a big factor.心理学家卡罗琳·比顿 （Caroline Beaton） 在 Forbes.com 上撰文表示，她认为千禧一代是一个重要因素。 Neil(尼尔)How do we define the term ‘millennial’? Also known as Generation Y – are people born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. It’s a common term in the news – often because people born in this time in the West are seen to have certain characteristics.我们如何定义“千禧一代”一词？也称为 Y 世代 – 出生于 1980 年代中期至 2000 年代初的人。这是新闻中的一个常见术语 —— 通常是因为出生在西方这个时期的人被认为具有某些特征。 Rob(罗伯)They’re sometimes described as lazy and obsessed with themselves – and while that’s not necessarily true, Caroline Beaton says millennials are highly self-critical.他们有时被描述为懒惰和沉迷于自己 —— 虽然这不一定是真的，但 Caroline Beaton 表示，千禧一代非常自我批评。 Neil(尼尔)Self-critical – they are aware of their own faults – which also means they’re more likely to spend time on money on self-help. She says they spend twice as much as Generation Xers. Generation X refers to people born between the late 60s and around 1980.自我批评 – 他们意识到自己的错误 – 这也意味着他们更有可能将时间花在金钱上进行自助。她说，他们的支出是 X 一代的两倍。X 世代是指 60 年代末至 1980 年左右出生的人。 Rob(罗伯)And one more possible reason why the self-help industry does well: it’s very resistant to recessions. When the economy does badly – as we say it goes into recession – people are perhaps even more likely to reach for self-help to improve their situation.自助行业表现良好的另一个可能原因是：它对经济衰退的抵抗力很强。当经济表现不佳时 —— 正如我们所说的，它陷入衰退 —— 人们可能更有可能寻求自助来改善他们的处境。 Neil(尼尔)So there we are. Now, let’s go back to another recession – the Great Depression of the 1930s in America – and to my question about which self-help book was published first?所以我们就是这样。现在，让我们回到另一场经济衰退 —— 1930 年代的美国大萧条 —— 以及我关于哪本自助书先出版的问题？ Rob(罗伯)Well – I said a) How to Win Friends and Influence People.嗯 - 我说的是 a） 如何赢得朋友和影响人们。 Neil(尼尔)In fact – two of these books were published in the late 1930s, How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie, was first in 1936. It has since sold over 30 million copies. Think and grow rich, by Napoleon Hill, was published in 1937, and is believed to have sold over 100 million copies!事实上 —— 其中两本书是在 1930 年代后期出版的，戴尔·卡内基 （Dale Carnegie） 的《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》于 1936 年首次出版。此后，它已售出超过 3000 万份。拿破仑·希尔 （Napoleon Hill） 的《思考与致富》于 1937 年出版，据信已售出超过 1 亿册！ Rob(罗伯)That’s a lot of self-help. Wow – have you read either of them?这是很多自助。哇 - 你读过它们中的任何一个吗？ Neil(尼尔)I haven’t read either of them but, perhaps, I should我没有读过它们中的任何一个，但也许我应该读 Rob(罗伯)Well, before we rush home and improve ourselves, let’s improve our vocabularies.好吧，在我们匆忙回家提高自己之前，让我们提高我们的词汇量。 Neil(尼尔)Of course – today we had: self-help - the activity of improving yourself – physically, mentally or in other ways – often through courses and books.当然 - 今天我们有： 自助 - 提高自己的活动 - 身体、精神或其他方式 - 通常通过课程和书籍。 Rob(罗伯)There are lots of trends in the self-help industry. And we also see trends in fashion, in music, in popular culture… Like the trend for men to grow beards.自助行业有很多趋势。我们还看到了时尚、音乐、流行文化的趋势……就像男人留胡子的趋势一样。 Neil(尼尔)Are you talking about me? Anyway, I think the beard trend is dwindling. It’s getting smaller, less influential.你说的是我吗？无论如何，我认为胡须趋势正在减少。它变得越来越小，影响力越来越小。 Rob(罗伯)Really? I stroke my beard here. I think it’s very therapeutic. It makes me relax and feel good.真？我抚摸着这里的胡须。我认为这非常有治疗作用。它让我放松，感觉很好。 Neil(尼尔)Maybe you’re right. What about our next phrase – to go from strength to strength?也许你是对的。我们的下一句话 – 不断壮大呢？ Rob(罗伯)You could say a business is going from strength to strength if it’s earning a lot of money.如果一家企业赚了很多钱，你可以说它正在不断发展壮大。 Neil(尼尔)Indeed. And what about our term for young people – millennial. Are you a millennial, Rob?事实上。那么我们对年轻人的称呼 —— 千禧一代呢？罗伯，你是千禧一代吗？ Rob(罗伯)Didn’t quite scraped in there. I’m still a Generation X. But I do like to think I’m in touch with what millennials do. Which includes – having lots of different social media accounts.没有完全在那里刮擦。我仍然是 X 世代。但我确实喜欢认为我与千禧一代的工作有联系。这包括 - 拥有许多不同的社交媒体帐户。 Neil(尼尔)Just like us – do look up BBC Learning English on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.就像我们一样 - 请在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上查找 BBC Learning English。 Rob(罗伯)And good luck with your self-improvement!祝你自我提升好运！ Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】self-helptrying to improve yourself without the help of professionals自助试图在没有专业人士帮助的情况下提升自己寻求自我改进（尤指不借助专业帮助）的行为She enrolled in a self-help course to try to cope with her depression. 她报名参加了一个自助课程，试图应对她的抑郁症。trendsomething new which is popular for a period趋势在一段时间内流行的新事物（时尚、潮流）一时的流行 The trend is towards smaller families.趋势是家庭规模越来越小。to dwindleto become fewer or weaker减少变少或变弱 Her savings dwindled to almost nothing.她的存款减少到几乎一文不名。therapeuticrelaxing; making you feel less anxious治疗性的令人放松的；让你感觉不那么焦虑的 The therapeutic benefits of gardening are well known.园艺的治疗益处是众所周知的。to go from strength to strengthto become more successful over time蒸蒸日上随着时间的推移变得更加成功 The business has gone from strength to strength since he took over.自从他接管以来，这项业务一直在蒸蒸日上。millennialsomeone born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s千禧一代出生于 20 世纪 80 年代中期至 21 世纪初的人 Millennials have grown up in a digital world.千禧一代在数字世界中长大。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】你能成为素食主义者吗？","path":"/2017/05/25/wechat-2017-05-25/","content":"【英文脚本】NeilHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. NeilNow, if you want to fight climate change – what can you do? CatherineWell, you can use less electricity… NeilOr stop driving… CatherineBut scientists believe there’s another behaviour which has an even bigger impact on the planet, and that is what you eat. NeilWe’re talking about meat here. If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets – harmful emissions could be reduced by 70%. That’s according to research from Oxford University. CatherineNow emissions are the gases produced by an activity or living thing – so we could talk about factory emissions or farming emissions. NeilAnd if you eat no meat or animal products you’re what we call ‘vegan’. More and more people around the world are going vegan. And today’s question: which of these celebrities is vegan? Is it… a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus? CatherineAnd I’m going to go for…c) Miley Cyrus. NeilWell, we’ll find out at the end of the programme. Now, before we go much further, why don’t we find out a bit more about exactly what it means to be vegan? CatherineHere’s Tom Kuehnel from the Vegan Society in the UK. Tom Kuehnel, Vegan SocietyVeganism is a way of living which excludes, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals. So that’s for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don’t want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age. It’s never been easier to be vegan. NeilOf course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it’s all about, but that doesn’t just mean food. If you’re a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out - no more leather shoes! CatherineBut he feels that it’s easier than ever before to become vegan – and uses a nice phrase: “in this day and age”. NeilYes. It means ‘these days’, or ‘in the present time’ – and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time. CatherineSo, many people go vegan for ethical reasons. Now ethical is a useful word, it means ‘relating to moral beliefs’, so if you become vegan for ethical reasons, you do it because you think it’s wrong to eat or use animal products. NeilOthers go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing livestock – that means animals like cows and pigs – produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let’s just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose veganism… CatherineVeganism – now, that’s the noun for the diet. Neil… is because they believe it is healthier. CatherineIn the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier, scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan. NeilNow, that’s human deaths. They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat, and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables – as well as fewer people being overweight. CatherineAnd they say that this would have an economic impact too. They suggest that up to $1,000bn a year would be saved due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work - because fewer people would get sick. NeilSo, if it’s all so simple – why don’t we all go vegan tomorrow? CatherineWell, meat-eating is an important part of most cultures – not everyone wants to change. NeilAnd millions of people worldwide raise livestock for a living. CatherineSo these jobs would disappear. Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be arid – which means dry and unable to support crops - people living in these regions rely on livestock, so people for example like the Berbers in the Sahara region. NeilWithout animal farming they would be forced to abandon traditional nomadic lifestyles – that’s where they move from place to place - and settle in cities. CatherineAnd for many people, well, they just like eating meat and dairy. NeilWe asked you about well-known vegans: which of these is vegan? a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus? CatherineAnd I said it was Miley Cyrus. NeilWell, you’re kind of half right, Catherine. In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan. Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently. CatherineNow, why don’t we wrap up by looking at today’s vocabulary one more time? NeilWell – we started with emissions: gases produced by something or an activity such as digestion. Livestock emissions for example – are gases produced by animals. CatherineWe can also add a word that describes a kind of emissions, like methane emissions or greenhouse gas emissions. NeilNext up we had in this day and age – which means ‘these days’. CatherineI still can’t believe you still don’t have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil. NeilWell, maybe I just object to smartphones for ethical reasons! CatherineSo you have for moral reasons to smartphones? NeilYeah, for me it’s important to understand the conditions of the workers in the factory where the smartphone is made. CatherineThat’s fair enough then. But, Neil, you haven’t become vegan yet for ethical reasons, have you? NeilYou’ve got me there – I admire veganism but I still like cheese too much to do it! Veganism is the noun. CatherineThat’s right. So two more words to go – we have arid and livestock. Arid describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants. NeilBut arid regions can sometimes support livestock – livestock means farm animals. If you think of the ‘stock’ as being the assets of a business, then animals are ‘living’ or ‘live’ stock. CatherineAnd that brings us to the end of today’s programme. Join us on our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages for lots more! Let us know what you think of veganism! NeilBye for now. CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.

If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets – harmful emissions could be reduced by 70%. That’s according to research from Oxford University.我们在这里谈论的是肉类。如果人们从饮食中不吃肉类和动物产品，有害排放可以减少 70%。这是根据牛津大学的研究得出的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now emissions are the gases produced by an activity or living thing – so we could talk about factory emissions or farming emissions.现在，排放是活动或生物产生的气体 —— 所以我们可以谈论工厂排放或农业排放。 Neil(尼尔)And if you eat no meat or animal products you’re what we call ‘vegan’. More and more people around the world are going vegan. And today’s question: which of these celebrities is vegan? Is it… a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus?如果您不吃肉类或动物产品，您就是我们所说的“素食主义者”。世界各地越来越多的人开始吃纯素。今天的问题是：这些名人中哪些是纯素的？是吗。。。a） 布拉德·皮特，b） 詹妮弗·洛佩兹或 c） 麦莉·赛勒斯？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m going to go for…c) Miley Cyrus.我要去……c） 麦莉·赛勒斯。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out at the end of the programme. Now, before we go much further, why don’t we find out a bit more about exactly what it means to be vegan?好吧，我们将在节目结束时找到答案。现在，在我们进一步讨论之前，我们为什么不更多地了解纯素的确切含义呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Here’s Tom Kuehnel from the Vegan Society in the UK.这是来自英国素食协会的 Tom Kuehnel。 Tom Kuehnel, Vegan Society(汤姆·库内尔，素食协会)Veganism is a way of living which excludes, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals. So that’s for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don’t want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age. It’s never been easier to be vegan.纯素主义是一种生活方式，它尽可能地排除一切形式的剥削和虐待动物。所以那是为了食物、衣服或任何其他目的。所以我们只是不想使用或虐待动物。我们觉得，你知道，这个时代有很多选择。成为纯素从未如此简单。 Neil(尼尔)Of course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it’s all about, but that doesn’t just mean food. If you’re a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out - no more leather shoes!当然，他说避免虐待动物就是它的全部意义所在，但这不仅仅意味着食物。如果您是真正的素食主义者，那么动物的服装也已经过时了 - 不再有皮鞋！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But he feels that it’s easier than ever before to become vegan – and uses a nice phrase: “in this day and age”.但他觉得成为纯素者比以往任何时候都容易 —— 并用了一个好词：“在这个时代”。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. It means ‘these days’, or ‘in the present time’ – and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time.是的。它的意思是“这些日子”或“在现在” —— 通常用于突出与以前的对比。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, many people go vegan for ethical reasons. Now ethical is a useful word, it means ‘relating to moral beliefs’, so if you become vegan for ethical reasons, you do it because you think it’s wrong to eat or use animal products.因此，许多人出于道德原因成为素食主义者。现在道德是一个有用的词，它的意思是“与道德信仰有关”，所以如果你出于道德原因成为纯素者，你这样做是因为你认为吃或使用动物产品是错误的。 Neil(尼尔)Others go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing livestock – that means animals like cows and pigs – produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let’s just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose veganism…正如我们之前看到的，其他人出于环境考虑而成为素食主义者。饲养牲畜（即牛和猪等动物）会产生大量有害的甲烷气体。现在，我们只能说动物自己从他们的身体中产生了很多 IT。选择素食主义的另一个主要原因…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Veganism – now, that’s the noun for the diet.素食主义 – 现在，这是饮食的名词。 Neil(尼尔)… is because they believe it is healthier.…是因为他们认为它更健康。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)In the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier, scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan.在我们之前提到的牛津大学研究中，科学家们发现，如果世界实行纯素，每年可以避免 800 万人死亡。 Neil(尼尔)Now, that’s human deaths. They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat, and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables – as well as fewer people being overweight.现在，那是人类死亡。他们声称，这个数字的一半是因为我们不再吃红肉，另一半是由于吃了更多健康的水果和蔬菜 —— 以及更少的超重者。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And they say that this would have an economic impact too. They suggest that up to $1,000bn a year would be saved due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work - because fewer people would get sick.他们说，这也会产生经济影响。他们建议，由于降低医疗保健成本和提高工作效率，每年将节省高达 10000 亿美元 —— 因为生病的人数减少了。 Neil(尼尔)So, if it’s all so simple – why don’t we all go vegan tomorrow?那么，如果一切都这么简单 —— 为什么我们明天不都成为纯素呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, meat-eating is an important part of most cultures – not everyone wants to change.嗯，吃肉是大多数文化的重要组成部分 —— 不是每个人都想改变。 Neil(尼尔)And millions of people worldwide raise livestock for a living.全世界有数百万人以饲养牲畜为生。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So these jobs would disappear. Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be arid – which means dry and unable to support crops - people living in these regions rely on livestock, so people for example like the Berbers in the Sahara region.所以这些工作会消失。现在，据估计，地球上有多达三分之一的土地是干旱的，这意味着干旱且无法维持农作物的生长，生活在这些地区的人们依赖畜牧业，例如撒哈拉地区的柏柏尔人。 Neil(尼尔)Without animal farming they would be forced to abandon traditional nomadic lifestyles – that’s where they move from place to place - and settle in cities.如果没有畜牧业，他们将被迫放弃传统的游牧生活方式 —— 那是他们从一个地方迁移到另一个地方的地方 —— 并在城市定居。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And for many people, well, they just like eating meat and dairy.对许多人来说，他们就是喜欢吃肉和奶制品。 Neil(尼尔)We asked you about well-known vegans: which of these is vegan? a) Brad Pitt, b) Jennifer Lopez or c) Miley Cyrus?我们询问了您有关知名素食主义者的信息：哪些是素食主义者？a） 布拉德·皮特，b） 詹妮弗·洛佩兹或 c） 麦莉·赛勒斯？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said it was Miley Cyrus.我说是麦莉·赛勒斯。 Neil(尼尔)Well, you’re kind of half right, Catherine. In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan. Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently.嗯，你说对了一半，Catherine。事实上，布拉德·皮特和麦莉·赛勒斯都是素食主义者。詹妮弗·洛佩兹 （Jennifer Lopez） 曾经是，但显然后来又开始吃肉了。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, why don’t we wrap up by looking at today’s vocabulary one more time?现在，我们为什么不再看一遍今天的词汇呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well – we started with emissions: gases produced by something or an activity such as digestion. Livestock emissions for example – are gases produced by animals.嗯 - 我们从排放开始：由某物或活动（如消化）产生的气体。例如，牲畜排放物是动物产生的气体。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)We can also add a word that describes a kind of emissions, like methane emissions or greenhouse gas emissions.我们还可以添加一个描述某种排放的词，例如甲烷排放或温室气体排放。 Neil(尼尔)Next up we had in this day and age – which means ‘these days’.接下来我们在这个时代 —— 意思是“这些日子”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I still can’t believe you still don’t have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil.我仍然不敢相信你在这个时代仍然没有智能手机，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe I just object to smartphones for ethical reasons!好吧，也许我只是出于道德原因反对智能手机！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)So you have for moral reasons to smartphones?所以你有出于道德原因对智能手机吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, for me it’s important to understand the conditions of the workers in the factory where the smartphone is made.是的，对我来说，了解智能手机生产工厂中工人的条件很重要。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s fair enough then. But, Neil, you haven’t become vegan yet for ethical reasons, have you?这很公平。但是，尼尔，出于道德原因，你还没有成为纯素者，对吧？ Neil(尼尔)You’ve got me there – I admire veganism but I still like cheese too much to do it! Veganism is the noun.你明白了 - 我钦佩素食主义，但我仍然太喜欢奶酪了！素食主义是名词。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. So two more words to go – we have arid and livestock. Arid describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants.没错。所以还有两个词要说 —— 我们有干旱和牲畜。干旱是指过于干燥而无法种植许多农作物或植物的土地。 Neil(尼尔)But arid regions can sometimes support livestock – livestock means farm animals. If you think of the ‘stock’ as being the assets of a business, then animals are ‘living’ or ‘live’ stock.但干旱地区有时可以养活畜牧业 —— 畜牧业是指农场动物。如果您将“存量”视为企业的资产，那么动物就是“活的”或“活的”存量。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that brings us to the end of today’s programme.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long. NeilYes. It’s 6 Minute English! CatherineAnd we have a challenge for everyone – can you stay focused for the full six minutes? NeilSounds easy? Maybe not, because today we’re talking about our attention spans: are they shrinking? CatherineThat’s right, so we’re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something – that’s our attention span – actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that – in fact, it claims the human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish. NeilCan that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media – these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it… a) around 30 minutes, b) around two and a half hours, or c) over three hours? CatherineI tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I’m going to say around two and a half hours - that’s answer ‘b’. NeilOK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it’s fallen to just eight seconds. CatherineRight, and that’s a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they’re to blame for all these distractions – now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention. NeilYes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier – goldfish reportedly have an attention span of nine seconds. That’s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds! CatherineAnd there’s a phrase in English – we say ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’. Or ‘the memory of a goldfish’. So these poor… poor gold goldfish, Neil. NeilYes, they get a bad press, don’t they? That’s a phrase which means ‘criticism’ – especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers – or the ‘press’, as we call it. CatherineSo – is it really true than humans are now even more easily distracted than fish? NeilWell, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim. CatherineThat’s right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly – they couldn’t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn’t find scientific evidence that our attention spans are in fact shrinking. NeilAnd secondly – the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring attention spans in the first place. It’s a term that’s widely used, but it’s not very scientific. CatherineSounds fishy. NeilYes. Fishy means ‘suspicious’, by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again. CatherineSo, are we humans in fact more easily distracted than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days. Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open UniversityIt’s all down to the individual; it’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone’s distracted by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn’t mean that they then don’t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task. NeilSo she says we’re not necessarily more easily distracted. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks. CatherineThat’s right. She’s really saying we can multitask better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time. NeilShe said: “It’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention.” Let’s just highlight that phrase down to. Here, it means ‘depends on’. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention. CatherineSo – maybe our attention spans aren’t getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more. NeilWhich reminds me today’s question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said? CatherineWell, my attention span is not that short that I can’t remember that I said two and a half hours. NeilAnd the answer – if you believe the research – is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine. CatherineThank you. NeilThat comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine? CatherineI try not to, what about you? NeilIt’s probably more than that to be honest. Now, I’m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones – or maybe they’re even touching them now as they listen – but either way, let’s have a review of today’s phrases. CatherineOK, so first we had attention span – that’s the length of time we can focus on something. And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be… Neil? Neil? NeilSorry – I just got distracted there by a message on my phone. Apologies. CatherineThat’s alright. So, next up we had a bad press. Goldfish get a bad press. Social media gets a bad press. And this means they all get criticism in the media. NeilAnd we had fishy. If something’s fishy, it’s suspicious. CatherineAnd we had multitask. To multitask is to do several things at once. NeilThen we had down to. Here it means ‘depends on’, though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it’s all down to the context! CatherineAnd that’s our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you distracted? NeilIf you’re looking for distractions – may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages? BothGoodbye. 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long.我是 Catherine。现在，这个节目时长为六分钟。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. It’s 6 Minute English!是的。这是六分钟英语！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we have a challenge for everyone – can you stay focused for the full six minutes?我们向每个人提出了一个挑战 - 您能否在整整六分钟内保持专注？ Neil(尼尔)Sounds easy? Maybe not, because today we’re talking about our attention spans: are they shrinking?听起来很容易？也许不是，因为今天我们谈论的是我们的注意力持续时间：它们是否在缩小？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right, so we’re asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something – that’s our attention span – actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that – in fact, it claims the human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish.没错，所以我们今天要问的是：我们可以专注于某件事的时间长度 —— 即我们的注意力持续时间 —— 真的变短了吗？现在，一项研究表明 —— 事实上，它声称人类的注意力持续时间现在比金鱼还短。 Neil(尼尔)Can that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media – these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it… a) around 30 minutes, b) around two and a half hours, or c) over three hours?这是真的吗？智能手机、互联网、社交媒体 —— 这些肯定都占据了我们的很多注意力。但多少呢？我们平均一天看手机多长时间？是吗。。。a） 大约 30 分钟，b） 大约两个半小时，还是 c） 超过 3 小时？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I’m going to say around two and a half hours - that’s answer ‘b’.我通常很忙，但我知道有些人真的沉迷于他们的手机，所以我要说大约两个半小时 - 这就是答案 ‘b’。 Neil(尼尔)OK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it’s fallen to just eight seconds.好的，那么，Microsoft 发布的一份报告称，2000 年人类的平均注意力持续时间为 12 秒。从那时起，它下降到只有 8 秒。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Right, and that’s a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they’re to blame for all these distractions – now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.是的，这是在很短的时间内发生的巨大变化。现在，2000 年正好是数字媒体和智能手机繁荣之前，因此许多人认为所有这些干扰都应该归咎于他们 —— 现在，干扰是夺走我们注意力或注意力的事情。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier – goldfish reportedly have an attention span of nine seconds. That’s one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds!是的。我们之前提到了金鱼 —— 据报道，金鱼的注意力持续时间为 9 秒。这比痴迷于手机的人类仅仅 8 秒多了 1 秒！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And there’s a phrase in English – we say ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’. Or ‘the memory of a goldfish’. So these poor… poor gold goldfish, Neil.英语中有一句话 —— 我们说 ‘to have the attention span of a goldfish’。或“金鱼的记忆”。所以这些可怜的……可怜的金鱼，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, they get a bad press, don’t they? That’s a phrase which means ‘criticism’ – especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers – or the ‘press’, as we call it.是的，他们受到了不好的报道，不是吗？这个短语的意思是“批评” —— 尤其是媒体和报纸上的批评 —— 或者我们称之为“新闻”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So – is it really true than humans are now even more easily distracted than fish?那么 —— 人类现在真的比鱼更容易分心吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim.好吧，BBC 广播节目 More or Less 最近调查了这一说法。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly – they couldn’t find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn’t find scientific evidence that our attention spans are in fact shrinking.没错。他们发现了几件事。首先 - 他们找不到 Microsoft 在其报告中引用的研究的证据。换句话说，该计划找不到科学证据证明我们的注意力持续时间实际上正在缩小。 Neil(尼尔)And secondly – the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring attention spans in the first place. It’s a term that’s widely used, but it’s not very scientific.其次 —— 他们采访的心理学家说，首先测量注意力持续时间的想法存在问题。这是一个被广泛使用的术语，但它不是很科学。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sounds fishy.听起来很可疑。 Neil(尼尔)Yes. Fishy means ‘suspicious’, by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again.是的。顺便说一句，Fishy 的意思是“可疑的”。对不起，金鱼。再。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, are we humans in fact more easily distracted than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days.那么，我们人类实际上是否比以前更容易分心呢？或多或少地问了开放大学的心理学家杰玛·布里格斯（Gemma Briggs）博士，如今人类是否不太能集中注意力。 Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open University(GemmaBriggs博士，开放大学心理学讲师)It’s all down to the individual; it’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone’s distracted by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn’t mean that they then don’t have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task.这一切都取决于个人；这完全取决于您选择如何应用注意力。因此，注意力切换能力很可能是在近年来，在智能手机和互联网时代发展起来的。但是，因为有人被智能手机分散了注意力或想快速用谷歌搜索某事，这并不意味着他们在执行另一项任务时没有能力和维持注意力的能力。 Neil(尼尔)So she says we’re not necessarily more easily distracted. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.所以她说我们不一定更容易分心。相反，我们实际上可能更擅长在不同任务之间快速切换注意力。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. She’s really saying we can multitask better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time.没错。她真的是在说我们可以比以前更好地同时处理多项任务。这意味着我们可以专注于许多不同的任务，每项任务的时间更短。 Neil(尼尔)She said: “It’s all down to how you choose to apply your attention.” Let’s just highlight that phrase down to. Here, it means ‘depends on’. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.她说：“这完全取决于你选择如何集中注意力。让我们把这句话具体强调一下。在这里，它的意思是 ‘depends on’。这完全取决于您选择如何应用注意力。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So – maybe our attention spans aren’t getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more.所以 - 也许我们的注意力持续时间并没有变短，我们只是选择更多地看手机。 Neil(尼尔)Which reminds me today’s question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said?这让我想起了今天的问题。我问你，我们平均花多长时间看手机，你说？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, my attention span is not that short that I can’t remember that I said two and a half hours.嗯，我的注意力持续时间并没有短到我记不清我说的是两个半小时。 Neil(尼尔)And the answer – if you believe the research – is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine.答案 - 如果你相信这项研究 - 是每天 2.42 小时，所以，猜得不错，凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you.谢谢。 Neil(尼尔)That comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine?该数据来自总部位于芝加哥的研究公司 Dscout。那么呢：他们调查的群体每天触摸他们的手机超过 2,600 次。Catherine 先生，您每天触摸手机 2,600 次吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I try not to, what about you?我尽量不这样做，你呢？ Neil(尼尔)It’s probably more than that to be honest. Now, I’m sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones – or maybe they’re even touching them now as they listen – but either way, let’s have a review of today’s phrases.老实说，这可能不止于此。现在，我敢肯定每个人都想重新触摸他们的手机 —— 或者他们现在甚至在听手机时触摸它们 —— 但无论哪种方式，让我们回顾一下今天的短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK, so first we had attention span – that’s the length of time we can focus on something. And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be… Neil? Neil?好的，首先我们有了注意力持续时间 —— 这是我们可以专注于某件事的时间长度。而且我的肯定比以前矮了……尼尔？尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Sorry – I just got distracted there by a message on my phone. Apologies.抱歉 - 我刚刚被手机上的消息分散了注意力。道歉。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s alright. So, next up we had a bad press. Goldfish get a bad press. Social media gets a bad press. And this means they all get criticism in the media.没关系。所以，接下来我们遇到了一个糟糕的新闻。金鱼受到了不好的报道。社交媒体受到了负面报道。这意味着他们都会受到媒体的批评。 Neil(尼尔)And we had fishy. If something’s fishy, it’s suspicious.我们吃了鱼。如果有什么可疑之处，那就是可疑的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we had multitask. To multitask is to do several things at once.而且我们有多任务。多任务处理是指同时做几件事。 Neil(尼尔)Then we had down to. Here it means ‘depends on’, though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it’s all down to the context!然后我们不得不开始。在这里，它的意思是 ‘depends on’，尽管在其他上下文中它可以表示其他事物。你可以说，这一切都取决于上下文！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that’s our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you distracted?这就是我们的快速回顾，也是我们今天的计划。那么，你是否一直保持专注？还是你分心了？ Neil(尼尔)If you’re looking for distractions – may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages?如果您正在寻找分散注意力的信息 - 我可以推荐我们的 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 页面吗？ Both(双)Goodbye.再见。 【核心词汇】attention spanthe length of time you can focus on something注意力持续时间你可以集中注意力的时长。A goldfish has an attention span of only nine seconds.金鱼的注意力持续时间只有9秒。 to distractto take someone’s focus away from something分散注意力把某人的注意力从某事上移开The music was so loud that it distracted me from my work.音乐太吵了，分散了我的工作注意力。 a bad presscriticism in the media媒体负面评价媒体上的批评The project has had a bad press from the start.这个项目从一开始就受到了媒体的负面评价。 fishysuspicious可疑的引起怀疑的Something fishy is going on here.这里面有些蹊跷。 to multitaskto do several things at once同时处理多项任务一次做几件事Women are better at multitasking than men.女性比男性更擅长同时处理多项任务。 down to(here) depending on取决于依赖于The decision is down to you.这个决定取决于你。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】你浪费了多少食物？","path":"/2017/05/11/wechat-2017-05-11/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it. DanNeil, you know you shouldn’t waste food. NeilWaste meaning to throw away without consuming or using. Ah, it’s only an apple. It’s not the end of the world, Dan. DanWell, that’s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week’s question.

I mean, they can’t give one customer’s leftovers to another! That would be unhygienic! DanLeftovers are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste. NeilSupermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by. DanThink closer to home. NeilIt’s us, isn’t it? DanYes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it? NeilI want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it’s not. DanNo. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays. NeilA landfill is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change. DanExactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%. NeilThat’s impressive, how did that happen? DanThey attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul. NeilI’ve heard about her. She became a household name in Denmark overnight! DanA household name is one which everybody knows, and that’s right. NeilI thought she was Russian? DanShe is. But, I’ll let her explain. Selina JuulI come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of infrastructure, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this abundance, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted. NeilSo Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of infrastructure, meaning the basic systems and services of a society – such as food transportation. DanThen when she moved to Denmark, she found an abundance, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted. NeilSo she decided to do something about it? DanYes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’ and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste. NeilHow did she do it? DanWell, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She’s produced a leftovers cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools. NeilWow, she’s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question. DanSure! I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter NeilAnd I said a) a half DanAnd I’m terribly sorry, mate, but you’re wrong. The answer is b) a third. NeilWell, it’s not as bad as I thought it was, at least. DanShall we look at the vocabulary then? NeilYes, let’s. First we had waste. If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we waste are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with waste too. Can you think of one, Dan? DanA waste of space is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can’t cook at all. Next we had leftovers. Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your leftovers, Neil? NeilOh I love leftovers! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal! DanI agree! Pizza’s a great example! NeilThen we had landfill. A landfill is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a dump. Do you ever take your rubbish to the dump, Dan? DanNot if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had a household name. To be a household name is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil? NeilOh, that’s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had infrastructure. Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society – such as electricity supply, trains, and roads. DanAnd finally we had abundance. If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in abundance, Neil? NeilWell, when it comes to my children I have to have an abundance of patience….well, most of the time. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! DanAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this episode we’ll be discussing food waste, just as soon as我是 Neil。在这一集中，我们将讨论食物浪费，只要 Dan(担)Neil, did you just throw the rest of that apple away?尼尔，你刚才把剩下的苹果都扔掉了吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah. It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it.是的。这是一个相当大的问题，我无法完成它。 Dan(担)Neil, you know you shouldn’t waste food.Neil，你知道你不应该浪费食物。 Neil(尼尔)Waste meaning to throw away without consuming or using. Ah, it’s only an apple. It’s not the end of the world, Dan.浪费的意思是不消费也不用就扔掉。啊，这只是一个苹果。这不是世界末日，丹。 Dan(担)Well, that’s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week’s question. How much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter嗯，这就是你可能错的地方，我的朋友。让我用本周的问题向你证明一下。世界上每年浪费多少食物？a） 二分之一 b） 三分之一 c） 四分之一 Neil(尼尔)I’m not sure. I know it’s a lot so I’m going to say a) a half我不确定。我知道这很多，所以我要说 a） 一半 Dan(担)We’ll find out if you’re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food, which is enough to feed a billion hungry people. Where do you think all this food waste comes from?我们将在本次节目结束时找出您的判断是否正确。因此，实际数字是 13 亿吨食物，足以养活 10 亿饥饿的人。您认为所有这些食物垃圾来自哪里？ Neil(尼尔)Well, restaurants, I imagine. I mean, they can’t give one customer’s leftovers to another! That would be unhygienic!嗯，我想是餐馆。我的意思是，他们不能把一个顾客的剩菜给另一个顾客！那太不卫生了！ Dan(担)Leftovers are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste.剩菜是未食用的食物残渣。虽然你是对的，但餐馆并不是食物浪费的主要来源。 Neil(尼尔)Supermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by.超市！我敢打赌，一旦食物超过了保质期或可以合法销售的日期，他们就会扔掉一大堆食物。 Dan(担)Think closer to home.想得更近一些。 Neil(尼尔)It’s us, isn’t it?是我们，不是吗？ Dan(担)Yes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it?是的。在欧洲，令人难以置信的是，53% 的食物垃圾来自家庭，每年造成 8800 万吨食物浪费。我敢打赌你猜不出我们用它做什么？ Neil(尼尔)I want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it’s not.我想说回收，但我可以从你的脸上看出，Dan，它不是。 Dan(担)No. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays.不。不幸的是，它进入垃圾填埋场并腐烂。 Neil(尼尔)A landfill is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change.垃圾填埋场是掩埋垃圾的地方。我明白了，所以食物会腐烂，这会导致温室气体，从而导致全球变暖和气候变化。 Dan(担)Exactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%.没错，世界末日。但是，值得注意的是，欧洲国家丹麦已经成功地将其食物浪费减少了 25%。 Neil(尼尔)That’s impressive, how did that happen?这太令人印象深刻了，这是怎么发生的呢？ Dan(担)They attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul.他们将其归功于一位名叫 Selina Juul 的女士。 Neil(尼尔)I’ve heard about her. She became a household name in Denmark overnight!我听说过她。她一夜之间成为丹麦家喻户晓的名字！ Dan(担)A household name is one which everybody knows, and that’s right.家喻户晓的名字是每个人都知道的名字，没错。 Neil(尼尔)I thought she was Russian?我以为她是俄罗斯人？ Dan(担)She is. But, I’ll let her explain.她是。但是，我会让她解释。 Selina Juul(塞琳娜·朱尔)I come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of infrastructure, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this abundance, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.我来自一个食物短缺的国家，当时在莫斯科，共产主义崩溃了，我们的基础设施崩溃了，我们不确定我们能否在餐桌上买到食物。来到丹麦，看到这里丰富多彩，看到这些超市里装满了食物。但后来我真的很震惊地看到很多食物被浪费了。 Neil(尼尔)So Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of infrastructure, meaning the basic systems and services of a society – such as food transportation.因此，Selina 在莫斯科长大，当时由于基础设施的崩溃，食物不足，这意味着一个社会的基本系统和服务 —— 例如食品运输。 Dan(担)Then when she moved to Denmark, she found an abundance, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted.然后，当她搬到丹麦时，她发现食物丰富，或者说绰绰有余，但她看到这些食物被浪费了。 Neil(尼尔)So she decided to do something about it?所以她决定做点什么？ Dan(担)Yes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’ and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste.是的。她在 2008 年开设了一个名为“停止浪费食物”的 Facebook 页面，9 年后，丹麦政府将减少食物浪费归功于她。 Neil(尼尔)How did she do it?她是怎么做到的呢？ Dan(担)Well, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She’s produced a leftovers cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools.嗯，真的有很多想法。她说服一些超市停止批量销售他们的商品，让人们只购买他们需要的东西。她制作了一本剩菜食谱，并与三个政府合作，在学校设立了一项教育计划。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, she’s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question.哇，她是个大忙的女人。那么，你用本周问题的答案来教育我怎么样。 Dan(担)Sure! I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year? a) a half b) a third c) a quarter确定！我问你，世界上每年浪费多少食物？a） 二分之一 b） 三分之一 c） 四分之一 Neil(尼尔)And I said a) a half我说 a） 一半 Dan(担)And I’m terribly sorry, mate, but you’re wrong. The answer is b) a third.我非常抱歉，伙计，但你错了。答案是 b） 三分之一。 Neil(尼尔)Well, it’s not as bad as I thought it was, at least.嗯，至少没有我想象的那么糟糕。 Dan(担)Shall we look at the vocabulary then?那么，我们应该看看这些词汇吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, let’s. First we had waste. If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we waste are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with waste too. Can you think of one, Dan?是的，让我们。首先，我们有废物。如果你浪费了什么东西，你就把它扔掉或丢失了，而没有使用它或消耗它。我们浪费的常见东西是食物、时间、金钱和精力。我们也有一些关于废物的表达。Dan，你能想到一个吗？ Dan(担)A waste of space is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can’t cook at all. Next we had leftovers. Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your leftovers, Neil?a waste of space 是一个表达方式，意思是一个东西完全没有价值。例如，我在厨房里完全浪费了空间。我根本不会做饭。接下来我们吃剩菜。剩菜是食物或饭菜的残渣，没有被吃掉。你打算怎么处理你的剩菜，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Oh I love leftovers! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal!哦，我喜欢剩菜！有时我觉得它们的味道甚至比原来的饭菜还要好！ Dan(担)I agree! Pizza’s a great example!我同意！披萨就是一个很好的例子！ Neil(尼尔)Then we had landfill. A landfill is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a dump. Do you ever take your rubbish to the dump, Dan?然后我们有了垃圾填埋场。垃圾填埋场是丢弃和掩埋垃圾的地方。在口语英语中，我们可以说，一个垃圾场。丹，你有没有把你的垃圾带到垃圾场？ Dan(担)Not if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had a household name. To be a household name is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil?如果我能帮得上忙的话，不会。我更喜欢尽可能多地回收利用。我只有在必须扔掉冰箱等大型电器时才会去垃圾场。然后我们就有了一个家喻户晓的名字。成为家喻户晓的名字就是被特定地方或文化的普通人所熟知。你能想到一个目前家喻户晓的人吗，Neil？ Neil(尼尔)Oh, that’s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had infrastructure. Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society – such as electricity supply, trains, and roads.哦，这很容易。唐纳德·特朗普浮现在脑海中！每个人都必须知道他是谁。然后我们有了基础设施。基础设施是一个社会的基本系统和服务，例如电力供应、火车和道路。 Dan(担)And finally we had abundance. If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in abundance, Neil?最后，我们得到了丰盛的财富。如果你有丰富的东西，你拥有的就比你需要的要多。有什么丰盛的东西吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Well, when it comes to my children I have to have an abundance of patience….well, most of the time. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!嗯，当涉及到我的孩子时，我必须有足够的耐心……嗯，大多数时候。这就是今天的六分钟 English 的结尾。请尽快再次加入我们！ Dan(担)And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I’m Neil. CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. Today we’re taking a look into the lives of the super rich – and we’re going to look at one of their favourite pastimes. NeilThe super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of assets. CatherineAssets are things we can own and sell – like property, boats and private planes. NeilExpensive toys. First things first, let’s do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years? a) China b) Brazil c) Vietnam? CatherineI’m going to go for Vietnam. I think, that’s an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future. NeilOk, well we’ll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade. CatherineNow, this doesn’t mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world’s richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world. NeilSo, my question is – what on earth do people with so much money spend it on? CatherineOne academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is …, Neil? NeilYachts! A yacht – a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate status symbol – that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society. CatherineLet’s listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What’s so unusual about yachts? Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff UniversityIf you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet – these are investable assets – something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs – and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they make good, sound business sense. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a black hole. NeilBefore we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain assets like planes and wine that made business sense. CatherineNow, to make sense – is a phrase you’ll be familiar with. So, if we say something makes business sense, it means ‘it’s good for business’. But yachts are different. NeilYachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a black hole of wealth. CatherineA black hole, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape – not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money! NeilIt’s also used conversationally to mean ‘a place where things go missing’. CatherineThese superyachts are big. The world’s longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study – she used to work on the yachts. NeilShe’s now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich. CatherineSo, what else did she learn? NeilShe says that in the world of the super rich – the size of your yacht shows your place in the pecking order. CatherineThe pecking order means ‘the social system from most powerful to least powerful’. NeilIf you’re higher up in the yachting pecking order, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently. CatherineApparently, so. It’s all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. Now that’s another great term – conspicuous means ‘visible or noticeable’ and consumption means ‘spending’. So, the phrase conspicuous consumption refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money. NeilBefore we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today’s question. CatherineI said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years. NeilWell, I’m very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam – according to the same report by Knight Frank – the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade. CatherineNow, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme? NeilVery good. We started with assets – here it means ‘things we can buy or sell’. What are your assets? CatherineOh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I’m not like you though Neil, I don’t live in an expensive mansion – that would be a real status symbol! NeilIf only that were true, but it’s a good example. A status symbol is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society. CatherineYes, and we had the phrase to make business sense – in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense. NeilOr I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they’re a black hole for our money. CatherineNow, did you know our next phrase, pecking order, actually comes from chicken behaviour? NeilAnd finally, the phrase conspicuous consumption. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is conspicuous consumption. CatherineAnd to clear up two similar phrases: a status symbol refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas conspicuous consumption refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you’re spending money so that other people notice. NeilDo check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Neil &amp; CatherineBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. Today we’re taking a look into the lives of the super rich – and we’re going to look at one of their favourite pastimes.我是 Catherine。今天，我们来看看超级富豪的生活 —— 我们将看看他们最喜欢的消遣方式之一。 Neil(尼尔)The super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of assets.超级富豪是拥有超过 3000 万美元资产的人。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Assets are things we can own and sell – like property, boats and private planes.资产是我们可以拥有和出售的东西，例如财产、船只和私人飞机。 Neil(尼尔)Expensive toys. First things first, let’s do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years? a) China b) Brazil c) Vietnam?昂贵的玩具。首先，让我们回答我们的问题，Catherine。预计未来 10 年哪个国家的超级富豪比例增长最快？a） 中国 b） 巴西 c） 越南？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m going to go for Vietnam. I think, that’s an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future.我要去越南。我认为，这是一个新兴的国家，我认为未来财富将有很大的增长。 Neil(尼尔)Ok, well we’ll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade.好的，我们稍后会知道你是对还是错。预计未来十年超级富豪的数量将增加 43%。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, this doesn’t mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world’s richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world.现在，这并不意味着每个人的收入都以相同的速度增长。你可能还记得去年的一份报告，其中说世界上最富有的 62 个人拥有的财产相当于全世界最贫穷的 50% 的人所拥有的财产。 Neil(尼尔)So, my question is – what on earth do people with so much money spend it on?所以，我的问题是 —— 有这么多钱的人到底把钱花在什么地方？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)One academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is …, Neil?英国的一位学者一直在研究这个问题。她的回答是……，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)Yachts! A yacht – a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate status symbol – that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society.游艇！游艇 – 用于娱乐的豪华船。终极身份象征 – 即让您炫耀财富和社会地位的物品。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What’s so unusual about yachts?让我们听听来自英国卡迪夫大学的 Emma Spence 的演讲。游艇有什么不寻常之处？ Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff University(EmmaSpence，卡迪夫大学博士研究员)If you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet – these are investable assets – something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs – and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they make good, sound business sense. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a black hole.如果您拥有独家葡萄酒收藏或艺术收藏，甚至购买了一架公务机 —— 这些都是可投资的资产 —— 您可以保值或累积价值。公务机（私人飞机）可以降低成本，并且比商业航空公司运行得更快、更舒适，使企业更加方便。因此，这些购买具有很好的、合理的商业意义。而超级游艇本质上是一个黑洞。 Neil(尼尔)Before we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain assets like planes and wine that made business sense.在我们进入游艇之前，Emma 谈到了某些具有商业意义的资产，例如飞机和葡萄酒。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, to make sense – is a phrase you’ll be familiar with. So, if we say something makes business sense, it means ‘it’s good for business’. But yachts are different.现在，要说得通 – 是你会熟悉的一个短语。因此，如果我们说某件事具有商业意义，那就意味着“它对企业有好处”。但游艇不同。 Neil(尼尔)Yachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a black hole of wealth.游艇，尤其是她所说的超级游艇，实际上是赔钱的。以至于她将超级游艇称为财富黑洞。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)A black hole, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape – not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money!从科学的角度来看，黑洞是一个引力如此强大以至于没有任何东西可以逃脱的地方 —— 即使是光。所以，从商业角度来说，黑洞会吃掉你所有的钱！ Neil(尼尔)It’s also used conversationally to mean ‘a place where things go missing’.它在会话中也用于表示“东西丢失的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)These superyachts are big. The world’s longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study – she used to work on the yachts.这些超级游艇很大。世界上最长的有 180 米长。他们需要专业的工作人员。这就是 Emma 开始学习的原因 —— 她曾经在游艇上工作。 Neil(尼尔)She’s now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich.她现在花了六年时间研究超级游艇和超级富豪的世界。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, what else did she learn?那么，她还学到了什么呢？ Neil(尼尔)She says that in the world of the super rich – the size of your yacht shows your place in the pecking order.她说，在超级富豪的世界里 —— 你的游艇的大小显示了你在啄食顺序中的位置。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)The pecking order means ‘the social system from most powerful to least powerful’.啄食顺序的意思是“从最强大到最不强大的社会制度”。 Neil(尼尔)If you’re higher up in the yachting pecking order, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently.如果您在游艇啄食顺序中排名靠前，您将获得港口中最好的位置。显然，这对游艇所有者来说非常重要。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Apparently, so. It’s all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. Now that’s another great term – conspicuous means ‘visible or noticeable’ and consumption means ‘spending’. So, the phrase conspicuous consumption refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money.显然，是的。这一切都与看到和被看到有关。你实际上可以说游艇是炫耀性消费的终极形式。这是另一个很棒的术语 —— conspicuous 的意思是“可见或引人注目”，consumption 的意思是“支出”。所以，炫耀性消费这个词指的是你做的那种购买，让别人注意到你的钱。 Neil(尼尔)Before we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today’s question.在我们驶向日落之前，凯瑟琳，我们来回答今天的问题怎么样。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years.我说过，越南是预计未来 10 年超级富豪比例增长最快的国家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I’m very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam – according to the same report by Knight Frank – the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade.嗯，我很高兴地说你是对的。事实上，根据莱坊 （Knight Frank） 的同一份报告，越南的超级富豪人口预计将在未来十年内增长 170%，令人震惊。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme?现在，我们再看看这个程序中的词汇财富怎么样？ Neil(尼尔)Very good. We started with assets – here it means ‘things we can buy or sell’. What are your assets?非常好。我们从资产开始 —— 这里的意思是“我们可以购买或出售的东西”。您的资产是什么？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Oh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I’m not like you though Neil, I don’t live in an expensive mansion – that would be a real status symbol!哦，你知道的，我的钻戒、我的自行车、我的笔记本电脑。我和你不一样，尼尔，我不住在昂贵的豪宅里 —— 那将是真正的身份象征！ Neil(尼尔)If only that were true, but it’s a good example. A status symbol is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society.如果这是真的就好了，但这是个好例子。身份象征是炫耀我们的财富和社会地位的财产。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, and we had the phrase to make business sense – in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense.是的，我们有一句话要有商业意义 —— 换句话说，对业务有利。我们也可以说某项特定政策具有经济意义。 Neil(尼尔)Or I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they’re a black hole for our money.或者我可以说明智地投资在财务上是有意义的。不像游艇，购买和运行成本很高。事实上，他们是我们资金的黑洞。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, did you know our next phrase, pecking order, actually comes from chicken behaviour?现在，您知道我们的下一个短语 Peking order 实际上来自鸡的行为吗？ Neil(尼尔)And finally, the phrase conspicuous consumption. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is conspicuous consumption.最后，短语 conspicuous consumption。例如，你可以说，在最好的餐厅穿着昂贵的衣服用餐是炫耀性消费。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And to clear up two similar phrases: a status symbol refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas conspicuous consumption refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you’re spending money so that other people notice.澄清两个类似的短语：身份象征是指物体本身，就像一辆豪华汽车；而炫耀性消费是指将钱花在昂贵的汽车等东西上的行为，但你花钱是为了让其他人注意到。 Neil(尼尔)Do check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.请在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上关注我们。 Neil &amp; Catherine(尼尔和凯瑟琳)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】assetsthings you can buy and sell资产你可以买卖的东西The company’s assets are valued at over $5 million.这家公司的资产估值超过500万美元。 status symbolsomething you own to show off your wealth and social position身份的象征你拥有的用来炫耀你的财富和社会地位的东西For many people, a large car is still a status symbol.对很多人来说，大汽车仍然是身份的象征。 to make business senseto be good for business具有商业意义对生意有好处The plan has to make business sense.这个计划必须具有商业意义。 black holesomewhere impossible to escape黑洞某处无法逃脱She felt as if she had fallen into a black hole of despair.她感觉好像掉进了一个绝望的黑洞。 pecking orderthe informal social system from most to least powerful等级制度从最有权势到最没权势的非正式社会系统There is a clearly defined pecking order within the company.公司内部存在着明确的等级制度。 conspicuous consumptionspending a lot of money so other people notice your wealth炫耀性消费花很多钱，这样别人就会注意到你的财富Conspicuous consumption is often associated with the newly rich.炫耀性消费通常与新富联系在一起。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】有人是从摩天大楼上坠落并幸存下来的？","path":"/2017/04/27/wechat-2017-04-27/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

DanYes, and though, unfortunately, Edgar didn’t survive, Alcides was found clutching, or holding extremely tightly, to the controls of the scaffold. NeilDid I hear correctly that he was trying to stand up? Did he escape the accident unscathed? DanUnscathed means without any injury at all. And, no, he fell into a coma for 3 weeks and needed 24 pints of blood. NeilI’m speechless. I don’t understand how he lived. DanYou aren’t the only one. Listen to what Dr. Philip Barie, from New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said about the whole incident. Philip Barie, New York-Presbyterian HospitalI don’t know what adjective you’d care to use: unprecedented, extraordinary. if you are a believer in miracles, this would be one. NeilWow. So he can’t explain it either. He said it was unprecedented which means never happened or done before. DanYes, and he also said that this was a miracle, which is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. NeilI guess we’ll never know. But one thing I can know is the answer to this week’s question. DanAh, yes. I asked you what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys? a) 30% b) 50% c) 70% NeilAnd I said b) 50% DanAnd you were exactly right. Well done. NeilWow! It’s a first! DanShall we look at the vocabulary then? NeilFirst we had a near-death experience, which is an experience where a person very nearly, or could easily have died. Have you ever had one, Dan? DanWhen I was 14 I fell out of a canoe into a river and got stuck between the boat and a rock with my head underwater. I thought it was the end. But, some people pulled me out. Then we had scaffold. A scaffold is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape. Name a place that you might see scaffolding, Neil. NeilThey are usually put up around houses when builders are working on the roof. Then we had clutching. If you clutch something, it means you hold it extremely tightly. There is a well-known idiom that uses this word. Sound familiar, Dan? DanAh, you’re clutching at straws, Neil, which means you are trying to find a reason or hope to succeed when it’s extremely unlikely. What was after that? NeilAfter that we had unscathed. If you are unscathed, you are uninjured. We often talk about escaping something unscathed. Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed? DanWell, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil? NeilNeil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969. And, finally, we had miracle. A miracle is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. The adjectives is miraculous. Do you believe in miracles, Dan? DanWell, I’ve never seen or experienced one, but when you hear a story like this, it’s difficult not to. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!

Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed?在那之后，我们就毫发无损了。如果你没有受伤，你就不会受伤。我们经常谈论毫发无损地逃离某物。你有没有安然无恙地逃脱事故？ Dan(担)Well, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I escaped unscathed. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard unprecedented. If something is unprecedented, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil?好吧，当我 6 岁时，我掉进了一些建筑商在进行翻新时挖的一个洞。我在车库里撞到了地，但不知何故我毫发无损地逃脱了。也许，我反弹了？然后我们听到了前所未有的声音。如果某件事是前所未有的，那么它以前从未发生过或做过。Neil，你能想出一个例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was unprecedented in 1969.

I’m Dan. And today we’re talking about… CatherineSighing. I’m Catherine. DanNow – was that a real sigh – or just one to demonstrate the meaning? CatherineThat one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan. DanWe’ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive! CatherineYes, very interesting. And it’s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan? DanIndeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today’s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it? a) Twice b) 10 times c) 40 times CatherineI’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour DanOK. Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly? CatherineLet’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK. Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam UniversityIt’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of resetting mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism. CatherineSo sighing keeps us alive. DanDr Barker called it a survival mechanism. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A mechanism, here, means a system of behaviour. CatherineSo, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism? DanIt’s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone. CatherineOK, that’s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs? DanWell, scientists from UCLA, that’s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly. CatherineAnd without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood. DanThankfully, we don’t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex. CatherineBoo! DanArgh! CatherineThere – you jumped! And that was a fabulous reflex, Dan! It’s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically. DanI meant like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine. CatherineYou’re welcome. DanDo you sigh a lot? CatherineWell, I sigh when I’m tired, and I sigh when I’m relieved. I breathe a sigh of relief. DanTo breathe a sigh of relief – that’s a great expression. It means what you think it means – to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened – but it’s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing. CatherineThat’s right. Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I’d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan? DanI tend to sigh to show frustration. And sometimes resignation. CatherineNow, frustration is what we feel when things aren’t going well, when things are annoying us and they don’t work. When things are frustrating. DanAnd resignation is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can’t change. We feel resigned to something. CatherineSo, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing! DanWell, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about. mice? CatherineWell, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour. DanWell, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster – so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans. CatherineLet’s review today’s vocabulary. DanWe had the phrase survival mechanism. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive. CatherineWe often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life. DanNext, we had reset. You can reset a computer, or a machine – to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again. CatherineAnd you can reset a password – this is a little bit different. It means to set – or choose - a new password. DanWe also had the word reflex. This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control. For example. Catherine? CatherineYes? DanThere, you closed your eyes. Another reflex. CatherineAnd we had to breathe a sigh to relief. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness. DanBut we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: frustration and resignation. CatherineFrustration is the state of being frustrated. We can say something is frustrating. It’s frustrating when my boss doesn’t listen to me. DanBut let’s say you move beyond feeling frustrated and start feeling resigned. CatherineYeah, and that would be when I finally accept my boss will never listen to me. And that’s when I’ll resign! DanTo resign also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that’s just another vocabulary example? CatherineOf course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?! DanWhich is perfectly average. And that’s it for today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. CatherineAnd we are on social media too. Make sure to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Dan. And today we’re talking about…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Dan。今天我们讨论的是…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sighing. I’m Catherine.叹息。我是 Catherine。 Dan(担)Now – was that a real sigh – or just one to demonstrate the meaning?现在 —— 这是真的叹息 —— 还是只是为了证明它的含义？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan.那只是为了教育目的，当然，Dan。 Dan(担)We’ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive!我们将看看我们为什么叹息，并了解叹息如何让我们活着！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, very interesting. And it’s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan?是的，非常有趣。叹息的不仅仅是人类，不是吗，Dan？ Dan(担)Indeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today’s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it? a) Twice b) 10 times c) 40 times事实上，大多数哺乳动物都会叹息。这就引出了我今天的问题。老鼠平均一小时会叹气多少次？是吗？a） 2 次 b） 10 次 c） 40 次 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour我要说这个可怜的小家伙每小时会叹气大约 40 次 Dan(担)OK. Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly?还行。让我们看看您在该计划的后面是否正确。那么，究竟什么是叹息呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.让我们听听英国谢菲尔德哈勒姆大学的认知神经科学家 Lynne Barker 博士的演讲。 Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University(谢菲尔德哈勒姆大学认知神经科学家LynneBarker博士)It’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of resetting mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die. It is a survival mechanism.这是一种典型的心肺重置机制，大多数哺乳动物都会进行某种形式的叹息。因为不叹息的人最终会死去。它是一种生存机制。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So sighing keeps us alive.所以叹息让我们活着。 Dan(担)Dr Barker called it a survival mechanism. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A mechanism, here, means a system of behaviour.巴克博士称其为一种生存机制。生存意味着继续生活，尤其是在困难的环境中。在这里，机制是指行为系统。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a survival mechanism?因此，生存机制是身体为了生存而自动做的事情。但是，Dan，为什么叹息是一种生存机制呢？ Dan(担)It’s because sighing can reset the lungs. To reset is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can reset a computer or a phone.这是因为叹息可以重置肺部。To reset 是将某些内容恢复到其原始设置。我们在谈论技术时经常使用这个动词。您可以重置计算机或手机。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK, that’s fine. But how does a sigh reset the lungs?好的，没关系。但是，一声叹息是如何使肺重置的呢？ Dan(担)Well, scientists from UCLA, that’s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly.加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）的科学家们发现，叹息是一种特殊的深呼吸，可以保持我们肺部的微小空气囊（称为肺泡）正常工作。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.如果不叹息，这些肺泡就会塌陷，我们就会死去。我们需要肺泡将氧气从肺部转移到血液中。 Dan(担)Thankfully, we don’t have to think about this need to reset our lungs. Sighing is in fact a reflex.值得庆幸的是，我们不必考虑重置肺部的需要。叹息实际上是一种条件反射。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Boo!喝倒彩！ Dan(担)Argh!啊！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)There – you jumped! And that was a fabulous reflex, Dan! It’s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically.你跳了！这真是一个美妙的反应，丹！这是我们的身体不假思索地做的事情，是你无意识或自动做的事情。 Dan(担)I meant like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine.我是说像个男人。谢谢你，凯瑟琳。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re welcome.别客气。 Dan(担)Do you sigh a lot?你是不是经常叹息？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I sigh when I’m tired, and I sigh when I’m relieved. I breathe a sigh of relief.嗯，累了就叹气，松了一口气就叹。我松了一口气。 Dan(担)To breathe a sigh of relief – that’s a great expression. It means what you think it means – to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened – but it’s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing.松一口气 – 这是一个很好的表达。它的意思是你认为的意思 —— 当你感觉良好时叹息，因为坏事没有发生 —— 但它经常被用来比喻。它更多地与解脱的感觉有关，而不是叹息的行为。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I’d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan?没错。现在，当我前几天找到我的手机时，我松了一口气。我以为我已经失去了它。它是新的。当我找到它时，我非常高兴！丹，你呢？ Dan(担)I tend to sigh to show frustration. And sometimes resignation.我倾向于叹息以表示沮丧。有时是无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, frustration is what we feel when things aren’t going well, when things are annoying us and they don’t work. When things are frustrating.现在，当事情进展不顺利时，当事情让我们烦恼并且它们不起作用时，我们会感到沮丧。当事情令人沮丧时。 Dan(担)And resignation is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can’t change. We feel resigned to something.而顺从是当我们最终接受发生了我们无法改变的坏事时的感觉。我们对某些事情感到无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!所以，解脱、顺从、沮丧、重置我们的肺。听起来我们人类从来没有停止过叹息！ Dan(担)Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about. mice?嗯，实际上，我们人类平均每小时叹息 12 次。但是呢。小 鼠？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.嗯，我说，我估计他们每小时大约叹气 40 次。 Dan(担)Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster – so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.嗯，事实上，它是每小时 40 次。老鼠的心脏跳动得更快 —— 因此它们比人类更需要调节自己的肺部。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Let’s review today’s vocabulary.让我们回顾一下今天的词汇。 Dan(担)We had the phrase survival mechanism. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.我们有 survival mechanism 这个词。我们不假思索地做的事情让我们活着。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)We often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.在谈论人们如何应对生活中的困难时，我们经常使用这个短语以及相关的短语 defence mechanism。 Dan(担)Next, we had reset. You can reset a computer, or a machine – to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again.接下来，我们重置了。您可以重置计算机或机器 – 使其再次工作。这通常意味着将其关闭并重新打开。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And you can reset a password – this is a little bit different. It means to set – or choose - a new password.您可以重置密码 – 这有点不同。这意味着设置或选择 - 新密码。 Dan(担)We also had the word reflex. This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control. For example. Catherine?我们还有 reflex 这个词。这是您无法控制的身体动作或反应。例如。凯瑟 琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes?是的？ Dan(担)There, you closed your eyes. Another reflex.在那里，你闭上了眼睛。又一次反射。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we had to breathe a sigh to relief. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.我们不得不松一口气。这意味着在坏事没有发生后感觉更好。当我的朋友从病中康复时，我松了一口气。 Dan(担)But we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: frustration and resignation.但我们也会因为其他原因而叹息。两个有用的叹息词是：沮丧和无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Frustration is the state of being frustrated. We can say something is frustrating. It’s frustrating when my boss doesn’t listen to me.挫折是沮丧的状态。我们可以说有些事情令人沮丧。当我的老板不听我的话时，这很令人沮丧。 Dan(担)But let’s say you move beyond feeling frustrated and start feeling resigned.但是，假设您不再感到沮丧，开始感到无奈。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yeah, and that would be when I finally accept my boss will never listen to me. And that’s when I’ll resign!是的，那时我终于接受了我的老板永远不会听我的话。那时我就要辞职了！ Dan(担)To resign also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that’s just another vocabulary example?To resigning 也意味着自愿离职！请问，Catherine，请告诉我这只是另一个词汇示例？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Of course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?!当然是，丹。我热爱我的工作！我只叹气，什么，每小时 12 次？！ Dan(担)Which is perfectly average. And that’s it for today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Neil. Today we’re talking about jobs. DanAnd I’m Dan. And specifically, we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job… NeilYes. On that note – Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer? DanI wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you? NeilThat doesn’t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call portfolio careers these days – so they can do a bit of everything. DanA portfolio, as a noun, means ‘a case for carrying large pictures’ – or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things – in this case, careers. NeilIndeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a portfolio career. DanSounds like a good combination. First, let’s do today’s question – it’s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as… bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it: a) Farmers b) Spies c) Guards NeilIt can’t be spies, can it? So I’m going to guess guards. C. DanGreat, well let’s find out at the end of the programme. NeilNow, the portfolio career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up. DanWhich specific example of a portfolio career does she mention? Emily Wapnick, AuthorMore and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs and it’s not just to make ends meet. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They’ve got, you know, three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they’re a serial entrepreneur. Or they’ve got a career in two different areas. There’s a guy I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier – he makes violins – and he’s very successful in both. NeilEmily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier – someone who makes violins. DanShe says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet – in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression – a serial entrepreneur – what’s that exactly? NeilWell, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses – and the use of serial here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity – such as a serial killer or serial murderer. DanNot the kind of portfolio career I had in mind. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business. NeilAnother thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast – it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it’s wise to add another string to your bow. DanA great phrase, which really just means ‘to learn new skills you can use in the future’. I’d like to learn Japanese – that would add another string to my bow. NeilSo desu, ne? But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money. DanHere’s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place. Charles Handy, Writer80% of the people in corporate jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you’re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they’re not making an awful lot of money. It’s a balancing job really, you’re free but you’re poor. Or you’re slaved but you’re richer. NeilSounds like a difficult choice – be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan? DanI’d rather be poor and free, thank you very much. NeilWell, let’s explain a term he used – a corporate job. What does corporate mean? DanQuite literally, it’s the adjective from the term corporation - a corporate job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation – usually well paid, and with certain benefits. NeilCould we say James Bond has a corporate career? DanYes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from? NeilAnd I said the Bonds were guards. DanI’m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years… The spying game came much later! NeilIndeed! Let’s spy today’s words once more. We had portfolio – which can be used in different ways. There’s a portfolio career, as well as the original meaning of a portfolio of art. Any others? DanYes, people talk about a portfolio of investments – if you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk. NeilTalking of money, we had to make ends meet. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to make ends meet – to make enough money to live on. DanThough having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a serial entrepreneur. Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime! NeilAnd an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses. DanI’d love to start a business… First, I need to learn a new skill - add another string to my bow and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business. NeilNot for me though, I prefer the corporate life – a secure job in a big corporation! DanOK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work! NeilAlright. DanAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. NeilAnd we are on social media of course. Make sure to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Neil(尼尔)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil. Today we’re talking about jobs.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 我们为您带来一个有趣的话题和六项词汇。我是 Neil。今天我们谈论的是就业。 Dan(担)And I’m Dan. And specifically, we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job…我是 Dan。具体来说，我们正在研究拥有多份工作的趋势…… Neil(尼尔)Yes. On that note – Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer?是的。关于这一点 - Dan，你小时候有没有问过这个问题？“你长大后想成为什么？”你还记得你的答案吗？ Dan(担)I wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you?我想成为忍者神龟。还有你？ Neil(尼尔)That doesn’t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call portfolio careers these days – so they can do a bit of everything.这并不让我感到惊讶。我想我想成为一名职业足球运动员。我想为英格兰效力。好吧，对许多人来说，这个问题随着年龄的增长而变得更加困难！这就是为什么现在越来越多的人拥有我们所谓的投资组合职业的原因之一 —— 这样他们就可以做任何事情。 Dan(担)A portfolio, as a noun, means ‘a case for carrying large pictures’ – or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things – in this case, careers.作品集作为名词，意思是“携带大照片的箱子” —— 或者它可以指照片本身的集合。但我们也将其用作形容词来描述某些事物的组 —— 在本例中，职业。 Neil(尼尔)Indeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a portfolio career.事实上，我们可以说兼职教师和兼职音乐家都有投资组合职业。 Dan(担)Sounds like a good combination. First, let’s do today’s question – it’s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as… bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it: a) Farmers b) Spies c) Guards听起来不错。首先，让我们来回答今天的问题 – 它与工作有关。许多英文姓氏最初来自职业。例如，贝克这个姓氏最初是给那些担任…面包 师！姓氏邦德（Bond）呢，比如双七（double-oh-seven）中的詹姆斯·邦德（James Bond）呢？这个姓氏是谁？是不是：a） 农民 b） 间谍 c） 守卫 Neil(尼尔)It can’t be spies, can it? So I’m going to guess guards. C.不可能是间谍，对吧？所以我要猜猜后卫。C. Dan(担)Great, well let’s find out at the end of the programme.太好了，让我们在节目结束时找出答案。 Neil(尼尔)Now, the portfolio career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up.现在，投资组合职业。艾米丽·瓦普尼克 （Emily Wapnick） 是加拿大作家，著有一本名为《如何成为一切：给那些（仍然）不知道自己长大后想成为什么的人的指南》的书。 Dan(担)Which specific example of a portfolio career does she mention?她提到了哪个投资组合职业的具体例子？ Emily Wapnick, Author(EmilyWapnick，作家)More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs and it’s not just to make ends meet. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They’ve got, you know, three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they’re a serial entrepreneur. Or they’ve got a career in two different areas. There’s a guy I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier – he makes violins – and he’s very successful in both.越来越多的人从事多种事情和多种工作，这不仅仅是为了维持生计。很多人都在选择这种生活方式。你知道，他们有三家不同的企业正在蓬勃发展。或者他们是一个连续创业者。或者他们在两个不同的领域都有职业生涯。我提到有一个人，他是一名心理治疗师和制琴师 —— 他制作小提琴 —— 他在这两方面都非常成功。 Neil(尼尔)Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier – someone who makes violins.Emily 显然是这种工作的粉丝。她说她认识一个既是心理治疗师又是制琴师的男人 —— 一个制作小提琴的人。 Dan(担)She says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet – in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression – a serial entrepreneur – what’s that exactly?她说，这种趋势不仅仅是为了维持生计而工作 —— 换句话说，努力赚到足够的钱来生活。她还用了另一个有趣的表达方式 —— a serial entrepreneur —— 那到底是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses – and the use of serial here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity – such as a serial killer or serial murderer.嗯，企业家是创办和经营企业的人 —— 在这里使用 serial 作为形容词来描述一次又一次地做同样事情的人。虽然我们应该说，这个形容词更常用于犯罪活动 —— 例如连环杀手或连环杀人犯。 Dan(担)Not the kind of portfolio career I had in mind. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business.不是我心目中的那种投资组合职业。另一方面，连续创业者一个接一个地开始和经营企业。 Neil(尼尔)Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast – it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it’s wise to add another string to your bow.另一件事，因为 Emily 相信工作世界正在快速变化 —— 能够做不止一件事是明智的。换句话说，在你的弓上再加一根弦是明智的。 Dan(担)A great phrase, which really just means ‘to learn new skills you can use in the future’. I’d like to learn Japanese – that would add another string to my bow.一个很棒的短语，它真的只是意味着“学习你将来可以使用的新技能”。我想学习日语 - 这将为我的弓增加另一根弦。 Neil(尼尔)So desu, ne? But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money.所以 desu，ne？但当然，选择投资组合职业并不适合所有人。这通常简单地归结为金钱。 Dan(担)Here’s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place.这是作家和哲学家查尔斯·汉迪 （Charles Handy），也是最早推广投资组合职业一词的人。 Charles Handy, Writer(CharlesHandy，作家)80% of the people in corporate jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you’re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they’re not making an awful lot of money. It’s a balancing job really, you’re free but you’re poor. Or you’re slaved but you’re richer.80% 的公司工作人员讨厌他们，或者对他们不满意。而如果你在做自己的事情，他们中的 80% 真的很喜欢自由和创业精神，即使他们赚的钱不多。这真的是一项平衡的工作，你很自由，但你很穷。或者你是奴隶，但你更富有。 Neil(尼尔)Sounds like a difficult choice – be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan?听起来像是一个艰难的选择 —— 要么贫穷，要么成为奴隶。你会选择什么，丹？ Dan(担)I’d rather be poor and free, thank you very much.我宁愿贫穷自由，非常感谢。 Neil(尼尔)Well, let’s explain a term he used – a corporate job. What does corporate mean?好吧，让我们解释一下他用的一个术语 —— 公司工作。公司是什么意思？ Dan(担)Quite literally, it’s the adjective from the term corporation - a corporate job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation – usually well paid, and with certain benefits.从字面上看，它是来自公司一词的形容词 - 公司工作是在大公司、公司或组织的工作 - 通常薪水很高，并有一定的福利。 Neil(尼尔)Could we say James Bond has a corporate career?我们能说詹姆斯·邦德有企业生涯吗？ Dan(担)Yes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?是的，我想是的！谢谢你提醒我回答今天的问题：邦德这个姓氏来自哪个职业？ Neil(尼尔)And I said the Bonds were guards.我说邦德夫妇是守卫。 Dan(担)I’m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years… The spying game came much later!恐怕你错了。邦德最初是农民，他们必须为特定的领主工作。这个词可以追溯到 1000 多年前……间谍游戏来得晚得多！ Neil(尼尔)Indeed! Let’s spy today’s words once more. We had portfolio – which can be used in different ways. There’s a portfolio career, as well as the original meaning of a portfolio of art. Any others?事实上！让我们再次窥探今天的文字。我们有投资组合 – 可以以不同的方式使用。有一个作品集职业，以及艺术作品集的原意。还有其他的吗？ Dan(担)Yes, people talk about a portfolio of investments – if you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.是的，人们谈论的是投资组合 —— 如果您同时投资几家公司以降低风险。 Neil(尼尔)Talking of money, we had to make ends meet. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to make ends meet – to make enough money to live on.说到钱，我们不得不维持生计。人们经常做一些不同的兼职工作来维持生计 —— 赚到足够的钱来维持生活。 Dan(担)Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a serial entrepreneur. Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime!虽然有很多兼职工作与成为连续创业者不同。Serial 意味着反复做某事，通常是犯罪！ Neil(尼尔)And an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses.企业家是创办和经营企业的人。 Dan(担)I’d love to start a business… First, I need to learn a new skill - add another string to my bow and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business.我很想创业…首先，我需要学习一项新技能 - 在我的弓上再加一根弦，学习瑜伽。然后也许有一天我会经营一家瑜伽生意。 Neil(尼尔)Not for me though, I prefer the corporate life – a secure job in a big corporation!但对我来说不是，我更喜欢公司生活 —— 在大公司找到一份稳定的工作！ Dan(担)OK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work!好的，但下班后你可以来参加我的瑜伽课！ Neil(尼尔)Alright.好。 Dan(担)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. Now, a favourite topic today: food, and how food can influence your mood. Dan, tell me, what food makes you happy? DanOh, you know, ice cream, chocolate… chocolate always puts a smile on my face. NeilAnd a few inches round your waistline! Sadly, the research we’ll be looking at today doesn’t suggest you eat more chocolate… but it does talk about bacteria! DanBacteria – those simple, small organisms – they make me happy? NeilAbsolutely, the so-called ‘good’ bacteria do! We’ll get to that, but first we’ll look at today’s question. How many bacteria are there in the human body? a) 39 million b) 39 billion c) 39 trillion DanThey are pretty small. I’m going to go for c) 39 trillion. NeilWell, we’ll find out if you’re right… by counting them one by one. DanThat’s going to take longer than six minutes! NeilYes it is, so let’s get moving! Scientists believe your mental state is connected to the bacteria in your gut. DanMy gut - my stomach and the other organs my food passes through… NeilYes. Researchers at McMaster University in Canada and University College Cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria help reduce anxiety in mice… DanAnxiety – the state of being worried or anxious. I don’t like the sound of an anxious mouse. NeilWell I’m afraid there’s another mouse experiment coming up. Researchers at Kyushu University found germ-free mice showed more stress… DanGerms – a general word for bacteria and microorganisms, usually the ones which cause disease… So germs help reduce stress and anxiety in mice. Any research on humans? NeilThe BBC TV programme Trust me, I’m a Doctor has just explored this. They looked at foods which are high in ‘good’ bacteria – a claim which more and more food products are making these days. DanYes, it’s a phrase that appears a lot in marketing. NeilBut many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well. They found that homemade fermented food was best. DanSo things like miso soup, kimchi, yoghurt, sauerkraut – all these are fermented. Have you tried all of those? NeilI love miso soup and kimchi. And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol. DanFermented foods are full of lots of good bacteria for your gut… Anything else from the BBC programme? NeilWell, this is the man behind the BBC study, Dr Michael Mosley. In this clip, a radio presenter asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy. PresenterWhat’s the good mood food? What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up? Dr Michael MosleyMediterranean diet. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for the brain; whole grains; lots of fruits and vegetables. Sugar: terrible for you. PresenterNot chocolate eclairs then? Dr Michael MosleySadly not. That will make you feel good for about 30 seconds until you finish it and then you feel terribly guilty. PresenterRight, ok. Mediterranean it is. DanHe said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean diet. Now, a diet can mean ‘an eating plan designed to help you lose weight’. NeilBut that’s not what it means here. Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people – in this case, the people living around the Mediterranean Sea. DanLots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables. And of course, add in plenty of fermented food too. NeilAnd don’t eat too many fatty, sugary, chocolaty things like chocolate eclairs – those are buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate. It’s really not rocket science, is it? DanEating healthily is pretty straightforward, even if the science behind it is complex. When you say something is not rocket science, you mean ‘it’s not difficult to understand’. NeilNow, are you ready for some counting? DanAh yes, you wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body! I said 39 trillion. NeilAnd you were right. The number goes up and down, but on average we’re thought to have around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body, according to the Weizmann Institute in Israel. The interesting thing is they think that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body. DanSo there’s more bacteria than human in me? NeilWell, maybe just you, Dan! Now, before the bacteria take over completely, let’s look over today’s words one more time. DanGut was first. It means ‘the stomach and other organs which digest our food’. But here’s an extra tip - the word can also mean ‘bravery’ when used in the plural. You’ve got guts, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office! NeilWhy thank you. Maybe I don’t feel any anxiety about how I look! Anxiety was our second word, and it means ‘fear or worry’. The adjective is anxious. DanYou know what makes me anxious? Germs. I wash my hands fifty times a day. I can’t stand the idea of getting ill from all the germs around here. NeilYes, germs are tiny organisms, and usually refers to those which carry disease. But as we heard, certain germs are good for you! DanEspecially those which are in fermented food. That’s food which has gone through a process where sugars turn into acids and alcohol. They often taste sour or bitter. NeilWe also talk about fermenting alcoholic drinks. Beer and wine are fermented. DanDoes that mean I should make them a part of my diet? A diet not only means ‘a healthy eating plan’, but can also mean ‘the foods and drinks consumed by an individual or group’. Which country has the best diet, Neil? NeilWell, in my opinion the Japanese diet. It’s my favourite anyway – very varied and plenty of fermented food! DanAnd finally we had – it’s not rocket science – it’s simple to understand. An example? NeilBrewing beer isn’t rocket science – you just need hops, yeast and patience. DanAnd there we are – a rocket speed review of today’s words! And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon. NeilAnd we are on social media too. Make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six items of incredibly useful vocabulary. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个非常有用的词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Now, a favourite topic today: food, and how food can influence your mood. Dan, tell me, what food makes you happy?我是 Neil。现在，今天最喜欢的话题是：食物，以及食物如何影响您的情绪。Dan，告诉我，什么食物让你快乐？ Dan(担)Oh, you know, ice cream, chocolate… chocolate always puts a smile on my face.哦，你知道的，冰淇淋、巧克力……巧克力总是让我脸上露出笑容。 Neil(尼尔)And a few inches round your waistline! Sadly, the research we’ll be looking at today doesn’t suggest you eat more chocolate… but it does talk about bacteria!还有几英寸的腰围！遗憾的是，我们今天要看的研究并不建议你多吃巧克力……但它确实谈到了细菌！ Dan(担)Bacteria – those simple, small organisms – they make me happy?细菌 – 那些简单的小生物 – 它们让我快乐吗？ Neil(尼尔)Absolutely, the so-called ‘good’ bacteria do! We’ll get to that, but first we’ll look at today’s question. How many bacteria are there in the human body? a) 39 million b) 39 billion c) 39 trillion绝对，所谓的“好”细菌确实如此！我们稍后会谈到这个问题，但首先我们要看看今天的问题。人体有多少细菌？a） 3900 万 b） 390 亿 c） 39 万亿 Dan(担)They are pretty small. I’m going to go for c) 39 trillion.它们很小。我打算选择 c） 39 万亿。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… by counting them one by one.好吧，我们会找出你是对的吗……通过一一数数。 Dan(担)That’s going to take longer than six minutes!这将花费超过六分钟的时间！ Neil(尼尔)Yes it is, so let’s get moving! Scientists believe your mental state is connected to the bacteria in your gut.是的，所以让我们开始吧！科学家认为，您的精神状态与肠道中的细菌有关。 Dan(担)My gut - my stomach and the other organs my food passes through…我的肠道 - 我的胃和我食物经过的其他器官…… Neil(尼尔)Yes. Researchers at McMaster University in Canada and University College Cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria help reduce anxiety in mice…是的。加拿大麦克马斯特大学和爱尔兰科克大学的研究人员发现，某些细菌有助于减轻小鼠的焦虑…… Dan(担)Anxiety – the state of being worried or anxious. I don’t like the sound of an anxious mouse.焦虑 – 担心或焦虑的状态。我不喜欢焦虑的老鼠的声音。 Neil(尼尔)Well I’m afraid there’s another mouse experiment coming up. Researchers at Kyushu University found germ-free mice showed more stress…嗯，恐怕还有另一个老鼠实验即将到来。九州大学的研究人员发现，无菌小鼠表现出更大的压力…… Dan(担)Germs – a general word for bacteria and microorganisms, usually the ones which cause disease… So germs help reduce stress and anxiety in mice. Any research on humans?病菌 – 细菌和微生物的通用词，通常是导致疾病的细菌和微生物……因此，细菌有助于减轻小鼠的压力和焦虑。有没有关于人类的研究？ Neil(尼尔)The BBC TV programme Trust me, I’m a Doctor has just explored this. They looked at foods which are high in ‘good’ bacteria – a claim which more and more food products are making these days.BBC 电视节目 相信我，我是医生 刚刚探讨了这个问题。他们研究了富含“有益”细菌的食物 —— 如今越来越多的食品正在提出这一说法。 Dan(担)Yes, it’s a phrase that appears a lot in marketing.是的，这是营销中经常出现的短语。 Neil(尼尔)But many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well. They found that homemade fermented food was best.但许多传统食品的有益细菌含量也很高。他们发现自制发酵食品是最好的。 Dan(担)So things like miso soup, kimchi, yoghurt, sauerkraut – all these are fermented. Have you tried all of those?所以像味噌汤、辛奇、酸奶、酸菜这样的东西 —— 所有这些都是发酵的。你试过所有这些吗？ Neil(尼尔)I love miso soup and kimchi. And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol.我喜欢味噌汤和辛奇。发酵是食物中的糖分转化为酸和酒精的过程。 Dan(担)Fermented foods are full of lots of good bacteria for your gut… Anything else from the BBC programme?发酵食品中含有大量对肠道有益的细菌……BBC 节目还有什么其他内容吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, this is the man behind the BBC study, Dr Michael Mosley. In this clip, a radio presenter asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy.嗯，这就是 BBC 研究的幕后推手，迈克尔·莫斯利博士。在这个剪辑中，一位电台主持人问他最好的食物是什么才能让我们快乐。 Presenter(主持人)What’s the good mood food? What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up?什么是好心情食物？我们现在该吃什么来振作起来呢？ Dr Michael Mosley(MichaelMosley医生)Mediterranean diet. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for the brain; whole grains; lots of fruits and vegetables. Sugar: terrible for you.地中海饮食。橄榄油；油性鱼，富含 Omega 3，对大脑真的很好；全谷物；大量的水果和蔬菜。糖：对你来说很糟糕。 Presenter(主持人)Not chocolate eclairs then?那不是巧克力泡芙吗？ Dr Michael Mosley(MichaelMosley医生)Sadly not. That will make you feel good for about 30 seconds until you finish it and then you feel terribly guilty.遗憾的是没有。这会让你感觉良好大约 30 秒，直到你完成它，然后你会感到非常内疚。 Presenter(主持人)Right, ok. Mediterranean it is.对，好的。它是地中海的。 Dan(担)He said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean diet. Now, a diet can mean ‘an eating plan designed to help you lose weight’.他说，最好的食物是地中海饮食。现在，节食可以意味着“旨在帮助您减肥的饮食计划”。 Neil(尼尔)But that’s not what it means here. Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people – in this case, the people living around the Mediterranean Sea.但这不是它的意思。在这里，它指的是一群人吃的食物和饮料 —— 在这种情况下，是生活在地中海周围的人们。 Dan(担)Lots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables. And of course, add in plenty of fermented food too.很多油性鱼、橄榄油、谷物、水果和蔬菜。当然，也要加入大量的发酵食品。 Neil(尼尔)And don’t eat too many fatty, sugary, chocolaty things like chocolate eclairs – those are buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate. It’s really not rocket science, is it?不要吃太多高脂肪、含糖、巧克力等巧克力类的东西 —— 那些是装满奶油并覆盖着巧克力的面包。这真的不是火箭科学，不是吗？ Dan(担)Eating healthily is pretty straightforward, even if the science behind it is complex. When you say something is not rocket science, you mean ‘it’s not difficult to understand’.健康饮食非常简单，即使其背后的科学很复杂。当你说某件事不是火箭科学时，你的意思是“它不难理解”。 Neil(尼尔)Now, are you ready for some counting?现在，您准备好进行一些计数了吗？ Dan(担)Ah yes, you wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body! I said 39 trillion.啊，是的，你要我数一数我体内所有的细菌！我说的是 39 万亿。 Neil(尼尔)And you were right. The number goes up and down, but on average we’re thought to have around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body, according to the Weizmann Institute in Israel. The interesting thing is they think that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body.你是对的。这个数字有起有落，但根据以色列魏茨曼研究所的数据，平均而言，我们体内大约有 39 万亿个细菌细胞。有趣的是，他们认为体内只有 30 万亿个人体细胞。 Dan(担)So there’s more bacteria than human in me?所以我体内的细菌比人类还多？ Neil(尼尔)Well, maybe just you, Dan! Now, before the bacteria take over completely, let’s look over today’s words one more time.好吧，也许就你一个人，丹！现在，在细菌完全接管之前，让我们再看一遍今天的文字。 Dan(担)Gut was first. It means ‘the stomach and other organs which digest our food’. But here’s an extra tip - the word can also mean ‘bravery’ when used in the plural. You’ve got guts, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office!肠道是第一位的。它的意思是“胃和其他消化我们食物的器官”。但这里有一个额外的提示 - 这个词在复数形式中使用时也可以表示“勇敢”。你有胆量，Neil，在这个办公室里穿着那件疯狂的衬衫！ Neil(尼尔)Why thank you. Maybe I don’t feel any anxiety about how I look! Anxiety was our second word, and it means ‘fear or worry’. The adjective is anxious.为什么谢谢你。也许我对自己的外表没有任何焦虑！焦虑是我们的第二个词，它的意思是“恐惧或担忧”。形容词是焦虑的。 Dan(担)You know what makes me anxious? Germs. I wash my hands fifty times a day. I can’t stand the idea of getting ill from all the germs around here.你知道是什么让我焦虑吗？病菌。我每天洗手 50 次。我无法忍受这里的所有病菌会生病。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, germs are tiny organisms, and usually refers to those which carry disease. But as we heard, certain germs are good for you!是的，病菌是微小的生物体，通常是指携带疾病的生物。但正如我们听说的那样，某些细菌对您有好处！ Dan(担)Especially those which are in fermented food. That’s food which has gone through a process where sugars turn into acids and alcohol. They often taste sour or bitter.尤其是那些在发酵食品中的。那是经历了糖转化为酸和酒精的过程的食物。它们通常尝起来是酸的或苦的。 Neil(尼尔)We also talk about fermenting alcoholic drinks. Beer and wine are fermented.我们还讨论了发酵酒精饮料。啤酒和葡萄酒经过发酵。 Dan(担)Does that mean I should make them a part of my diet? A diet not only means ‘a healthy eating plan’, but can also mean ‘the foods and drinks consumed by an individual or group’. Which country has the best diet, Neil?这是否意味着我应该将它们作为我饮食的一部分？节食不仅意味着“健康的饮食计划”，还可以意味着“个人或群体食用的食物和饮料”。尼尔，哪个国家的饮食最好？ Neil(尼尔)Well, in my opinion the Japanese diet. It’s my favourite anyway – very varied and plenty of fermented food!嗯，在我看来是日本的饮食。无论如何，这是我最喜欢的 - 种类繁多且发酵食品丰富！ Dan(担)And finally we had – it’s not rocket science – it’s simple to understand. An example?最后，我们有了 - 这不是火箭科学 - 它很容易理解。一个例子？ Neil(尼尔)Brewing beer isn’t rocket science – you just need hops, yeast and patience.酿造啤酒不是火箭科学 —— 你只需要啤酒花、酵母和耐心。 Dan(担)And there we are – a rocket speed review of today’s words! And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon.我们就这样 - 对今天的话进行火箭般的速度回顾！这就是今天的六分钟 English 的结尾。请尽快再次加入我们。 Neil(尼尔)And we are on social media too.

I’m Dan. NeilAnd I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection. DanEverything ok, Neil? NeilI am so tired. One of my children is as sick as a dog. I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them. DanAs sick as a dog is an expression meaning ‘very ill’. I’m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can. NeilDon’t worry. There’s life in this old dog yet. DanGood. It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer. NeilAmazing. Any success? DanLet me ask you in this week’s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? Is it a) 50% b) 70% c) 90% NeilI’m going to guess a) 50% DanWe’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think? NeilA wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man’s best friend? But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable? DanWell, I’ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one. Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection DogsAlthough the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated bio- sensor. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been screened by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health? DanSo, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a bio-sensor, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Neil Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to screen, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs. DanYep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans? NeilWell, there’s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger. DanNice. Any more? Maybe around the home? NeilAre you referring to guard dogs, meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.’ DanYep. Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger deterrent, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system. NeilOh and there’s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes. DanExactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them. NeilDo you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time biosensors then? DanWell, I don’t know, but here’s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter. Jeremy Hunt, Health SecretaryOne of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully. DanHe mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let’s hope so. NeilYes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to. DanOh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? a) 50% b) 70% c) 90% NeilAnd I said 50% DanIt’s a dog’s life, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer was c) 90% NeilWow! 90%! That’s amazing. DanIsn’t it? NeilShall we go through the vocabulary? DanOK. The first expression we had was as sick as a dog. If you are as sick as a dog it means that you’re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were as sick as a dog, Neil? NeilJust after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was as sick as a dog. Next we had paws. Paws are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan? DanWell, dogs have paws. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After paws, we had biosensor. A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil? NeilWell, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic. Then we had screen. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport – where they would screen for explosives. How else can it be used, Dan? DanWell, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was deterrent. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil? NeilThat’s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart. DanGood idea! NeilFinally, we heard orthodoxies. An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective isorthodox and we often hear its opposite word – unorthodox, meaning unusual. Do you do anythingunorthodox, Dan? DanWell I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It’s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try! NeilI don’t blame them! Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! DanAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan.您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan。 Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.我是 Neil。我们将讨论用于癌症检测的狗。 Dan(担)Everything ok, Neil?一切都还好吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)I am so tired. One of my children is as sick as a dog. I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them.我好累。我的一个孩子病得像狗一样。我整晚都没有睡觉照顾他们。 Dan(担)As sick as a dog is an expression meaning ‘very ill’. I’m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can.As sick as a dog 是一个表达，意思是“病得很重”。听到这个消息，我感到很遗憾。如果可以的话，试着坚持下去。 Neil(尼尔)Don’t worry. There’s life in this old dog yet.不用担心。这只老狗还有生命。 Dan(担)Good. It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.好。你提到狗很有趣，因为显然，英国国家卫生服务局目前正在评估狗是否可以用于检测早期前列腺癌。 Neil(尼尔)Amazing. Any success?了不起。成功了吗？ Dan(担)Let me ask you in this week’s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? Is it a) 50% b) 70% c) 90%让我在本周的问题中问你。在多大的病例中，狗能够检测到尿液中是否存在癌症？是 a） 50% b） 70% c） 90% Neil(尼尔)I’m going to guess a) 50%我猜 a） 50% Dan(担)We’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?我们稍后会知道你是对还是错。所以，尼尔，我说狗，你怎么看？ Neil(尼尔)A wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man’s best friend? But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable?湿漉漉的鼻子、四只爪子，也就是我们所说的某些动物的脚，蓬松的外套和摇晃的尾巴？人类最好的朋友？但我从来没有听说过癌症狗。我想知道是什么让它们适合？ Dan(担)Well, I’ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one.好吧，我让慈善机构 Medical Detection Dogs 的首席执行官 Claire Guest 博士来回答这个问题。 Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs(DrClaireGuest，MedicalDetectionDogs首席执行官)Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated bio- sensor. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been screened by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?虽然这只狗有蓬松的皮毛和摇晃的尾巴，但它实际上是一个高度复杂的生物传感器。你知道，进化赋予了他这个高度敏感的鼻子，可以精确到万亿分之几。人们每天登上经过搜查犬检查的飞机，看看机上是否有爆炸物。为什么我们在那里依赖他们，却不帮助我们保持健康？ Dan(担)So, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a bio-sensor, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Neil Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to screen, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs.因此，狗已经进化到具有高度发达的嗅觉，这使它们能够充当生物传感器，一种使用生物检测化学物质的传感器。Neil 是的，她提到人类有使用警犬进行安全检查或检查爆炸物和炸弹是否适合的历史。 Dan(担)Yep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?是的！你能想到其他什么地方用狗来支持人类吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, there’s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger.嗯，有导盲犬，或者北美众所周知的导盲犬。他们帮助盲人避免危险。 Dan(担)Nice. Any more? Maybe around the home?好。还有吗？也许在家里？ Neil(尼尔)Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.’您指的是护卫犬，意思是“保护房屋或地方免受入室盗窃、盗窃或非法侵入的狗”。 Dan(担)Yep. Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger deterrent, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system.是的。前窃贼经常说，它们比警报系统更具有威慑力，或者说有理由不做某事。 Neil(尼尔)Oh and there’s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes.哦，还有救援犬。他们接受过搜索和寻找雪崩或地震等自然灾害受害者的培训。 Dan(担)Exactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them.没错，狗非常适合人们可能被埋在地下或雪下的情况。人类看不到它们，但狗仍然可以闻到它们。 Neil(尼尔)Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time biosensors then?您认为我们的国家卫生服务局会将它们用作全职生物传感器吗？ Dan(担)Well, I don’t know, but here’s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter.嗯，我不知道，但以下是英国卫生大臣杰里米·亨特 （Jeremy Hunt） 对此事的看法。 Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary(卫生大臣JeremyHunt)One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully.作为国会议员，我们的工作之一有时就是质疑正统观念，所以如果这项研究是好的，那么我想了解它，我肯定会仔细研究它。 Dan(担)He mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let’s hope so.他提到，这种类型的研究违背了正统或普遍接受的做事方式。但他也提到他会仔细研究它。所以让我们希望如此。 Neil(尼尔)Yes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to.是的，我不介意有个狗医生！说到研究，有一个问题我需要知道答案。 Dan(担)Oh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine? a) 50% b) 70% c) 90%哦，是的。我问你，在多大的病例中，狗能够检测到尿液中癌症的存在？a） 50% b） 70% c） 90% Neil(尼尔)And I said 50%我说 50% Dan(担)It’s a dog’s life, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer was c) 90%这是狗的生活，尼尔。对不起。答案是 c） 90% Neil(尼尔)Wow! 90%! That’s amazing.哇！90%!这太神奇了。 Dan(担)Isn’t it?不是吗？ Neil(尼尔)Shall we go through the vocabulary?我们应该浏览一下词汇吗？ Dan(担)OK. The first expression we had was as sick as a dog. If you are as sick as a dog it means that you’re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were as sick as a dog, Neil?还行。我们的第一个表情就像狗一样病恹恹的。如果你病得像狗一样，那就意味着你确实病得很重。尼尔，你上一次病得像狗是什么时候？ Neil(尼尔)Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was as sick as a dog. Next we had paws. Paws are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan?圣诞节刚过，我就从我的孩子们那里抓到了一只虫子。我病得像条狗一样。接下来我们有爪子。爪子是某些动物的脚。他们有垫子和爪子。Dan，您能给我们举几个例子吗？ Dan(担)Well, dogs have paws. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After paws, we had biosensor. A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?嗯，狗有爪子。猫、兔子、熊和老鼠也是如此。但不是马、羊或猪。他们有蹄子。在爪子之后，我们有生物传感器。生物传感器是 biology 和 sensor 这两个词的组合。它是一种使用生物来检测化学物质的传感器。尼尔，你能想到一个著名的历史例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic. Then we had screen. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport – where they would screen for explosives. How else can it be used, Dan?好吧，处于一种叫做甲烷的剧毒但看不见的气体危险中的矿工过去常常带着笼子里的金丝雀下矿井。如果金丝雀生病或死亡，他们知道空气有毒。然后我们有屏幕。如果您检查某样东西，则意味着您检查其适用性，例如行李通过机场 – 他们会在那里检查爆炸物。丹，它还能怎么用呢？ Dan(担)Well, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was deterrent. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil?好吧，如今，您可以在您的计算机上安装一个广告拦截器，它可以过滤掉那些烦人的弹出广告。我讨厌那些！在那之后是威慑力。威慑是阻止一个人做某事的事情，例如害怕犯罪受到惩罚。你怎么阻止你的孩子顽皮，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)That’s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart.这很简单。我只是威胁要从他们的贴纸图表中删除一个贴纸。 Dan(担)Good idea!好主意！ Neil(尼尔)Finally, we heard orthodoxies. An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective isorthodox and we often hear its opposite word – unorthodox, meaning unusual. Do you do anythingunorthodox, Dan?最后，我们听到了正统的说法。正统是一种普遍接受的做事方式。它的形容词是 orthodox，我们经常听到它的反词 – unorthodox，意思是不寻常。丹，你做了什么非正统的事情吗？ Dan(担)Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons. DanYou know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they’re not that new, either. NeilOh really? DanWell, that’s the perfect opportunity to ask this week’s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it? a) 1606 b) 1862 c) 1982 NeilIt must be 1982. I’ll go with c). DanWe’ll find out if you’re right or wrong later in the programme. NeilYou know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what’s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? DanGood point. Emoticons came first. They’re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard – usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon – two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a… NeilA smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails! DanWell, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It’s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles… NeilAh yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you’ll have to convince me – why do people use them so much? DanWell, let’s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code: Professor Vyv Evans, Author of ‘The Emoji Code’They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication. Increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face- to-face interaction. In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively. NeilOk so he used a very useful word - empathy. It means ‘the ability to show you understand someone else’s feelings’. Ok – tell me more Dan. DanYes – adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy – more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction – as he says. NeilInteraction, meaning ‘when people or things communicate with each other’. We can also interact with things like machines, computers and social media. DanYes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we’re talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues. NeilWow, that’s a lot. A cue is a signal that you need to do something. DanFor example, an actor goes on stage after their cue. NeilAnd non-verbal means ‘without using spoken language’. So, here in the studio there are lots of other non-verbal signals about how we’re feeling - non-verbal cues. For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan DanThere’s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let’s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer – how would you respond? NeilWell, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly? DanIf I followed it with a sad face emoji, then…? NeilThen I guess I’d know you hurt yourself. Poor you. DanBut if I followed it with a laughing emoji – the one with the tears coming out because I’m laughing so much? NeilThen I’d probably reply saying how stupid and clumsy you are! DanExactly – without adding the emoji – it’s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the non-verbal cue – like my facial expression. NeilBy the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy? Clumsy, means ‘physically awkward’ – someone who’s clumsy falls over a lot and drops things. Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren’t as new as I think? DanYes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982? NeilI said 1982. DanWell, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets. NeilLike a winking face? DanExactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error – or what we normally call a typo. NeilA typo – a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly. DanThe official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in digital a communication. NeilWow, so they’re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let’s round up with another look at today’s words. DanSure. The first word we had was empathy. Do you have a lot of empathy, Neil? NeilYes, I think I’m quite good at understanding other people’s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It’s important to empathise with your colleagues too. DanThat’s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction. NeilNicely done. If two people interact, it means they ‘communicate with each other and react to each other’. It’s a pretty broad term. DanWe could also talk about how the way children interact with the internet. NeilWay too much! Next up, we had non-verbal, meaning ‘without spoken language’. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan? DanNext word… that is my cue to say the next word – which is in fact – cue. A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a cue to attack. Or I could give you a cue to… sing a song? NeilNo thanks. I’ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like clumsy – meaning ‘physically awkward’. I’d have to say Dan, you’re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you’re not clumsy at all. DanThat’s what I thought until I broke my leg – after a clumsy opponent ran into me… NeilOuch. Finally – we had type. No hang on, that’s not right. It should say typo. A typo is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message. DanAlways check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! NeilAnd we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 – 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个新词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. We’ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons.我是 Neil。我们将讨论那些我们称之为表情符号和表情符号的小图形的兴起。 Dan(担)You know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they’re not that new, either.你知道，我认为表情符号是交流的重要工具。实际上，它们也不是那么新鲜。 Neil(尼尔)Oh really?真的？ Dan(担)Well, that’s the perfect opportunity to ask this week’s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it? a) 1606 b) 1862 c) 1982嗯，这是提出本周问题的绝佳机会。第一个表情符号是什么时候使用的？是吗？a） 1606 b） 1862 c） 1982 Neil(尼尔)It must be 1982. I’ll go with c).那一定是 1982 年。我选择 c）。 Dan(担)We’ll find out if you’re right or wrong later in the programme.我们将在稍后的计划中找出您的判断是对还是错。 Neil(尼尔)You know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what’s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?你知道，我认为在我们进一步讨论之前，我们应该澄清一件事：表情符号和表情符号有什么区别？ Dan(担)Good point. Emoticons came first. They’re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard – usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon – two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a…说得好。表情符号是第一位的。它们是使用键盘上的普通键制作的图像 - 通常是标点符号、字母和数字。例如，冒号 - 两个点 - 后跟右括号的曲线是… Neil(尼尔)A smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails!一张笑脸。你在太多的电子邮件中使用的东西！ Dan(担)Well, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It’s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles…嗯，谢谢！而表情符号是完全不同的东西。这是一个真实的图像。它可以是一张简单的黄色笑脸；或者像跳舞的女士一样的东西；甚至是一碗面条…… Neil(尼尔)Ah yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you’ll have to convince me – why do people use them so much?啊，是的，我们手机里的所有那些小图片。但你得说服我 —— 为什么人们这么频繁地使用它们？ Dan(担)Well, let’s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code:好吧，让我们听听 Vyv Evans 教授的话。他写了一本书，叫《表情符号代码》（The Emoji Code）： Professor Vyv Evans, Author of ‘The Emoji Code’(VyvEvans教授，《TheEmojiCode》的作者)They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication. Increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face- to-face interaction. In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively.它们使我们能够在数字通信中表达情感和同理心。我们越来越多地发现，数字通信正在取代面对面互动的某些方面。例如，在今天的英国，成年人平均每周花 22 小时上网。表情符号如此有趣的原因之一是它们确实使我们能够更有效地表达我们的情感自我。 Neil(尼尔)Ok so he used a very useful word - empathy. It means ‘the ability to show you understand someone else’s feelings’. Ok – tell me more Dan.好的，所以他用了一个非常有用的词 —— 同理心。它的意思是“表明你理解别人的感受的能力”。好的 - 告诉我更多 Dan。 Dan(担)Yes – adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show empathy – more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction – as he says.是的 - 添加表情符号可以更清楚地表明你理解和表达情感，并表现出同理心。正如他所说，在数字通信中，我们缺乏面对面互动中的视觉信号。 Neil(尼尔)Interaction, meaning ‘when people or things communicate with each other’. We can also interact with things like machines, computers and social media.交互，意思是“当人或事物相互交流时”。我们还可以与机器、计算机和社交媒体等事物进行交互。 Dan(担)Yes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we’re talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues.是的，埃文斯教授说，当我们相互交谈时，60% 的信息来自非语言线索。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, that’s a lot. A cue is a signal that you need to do something.哇，好多。提示是您需要做某事的信号。 Dan(担)For example, an actor goes on stage after their cue.例如，演员在提示后上台。 Neil(尼尔)And non-verbal means ‘without using spoken language’. So, here in the studio there are lots of other non-verbal signals about how we’re feeling - non-verbal cues. For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan非语言的意思是“不使用口语”。所以，在录音室里，还有许多其他关于我们感受的非语言信号 —— 非语言暗示。例如我的面部表情、我的肢体语言、我的眼神、Dan Dan(担)There’s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let’s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer – how would you respond?那里有一丝愤怒，Neil。好的，让我们将其应用于数字通信。想象一下，我给你发了一条短信，说我用锤子敲打了我的手指 —— 你会怎么回应？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly?嗯，这要看情况。你伤得很重吗？ Dan(担)If I followed it with a sad face emoji, then…?如果我跟着一个悲伤的表情符号，那么……？ Neil(尼尔)Then I guess I’d know you hurt yourself. Poor you.那我就知道你伤到了自己。可怜的你。 Dan(担)But if I followed it with a laughing emoji – the one with the tears coming out because I’m laughing so much?但是，如果我跟着一个大笑的表情符号 —— 那个因为我笑得太多而流泪的表情符号呢？ Neil(尼尔)Then I’d probably reply saying how stupid and clumsy you are!那我可能会回答说你多么愚蠢和笨拙！ Dan(担)Exactly – without adding the emoji – it’s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the non-verbal cue – like my facial expression.确切地说 - 如果不添加表情符号 - 很难知道我的情绪状态。表情符号是非语言暗示 —— 就像我的面部表情一样。 Neil(尼尔)By the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy? Clumsy, means ‘physically awkward’ – someone who’s clumsy falls over a lot and drops things. Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren’t as new as I think?顺便说一句，有没有表示笨拙的表情符号？笨拙，意思是“身体笨拙” —— 笨拙的人经常摔倒并掉落东西。不管怎样，你是说表情符号并不像我想象的那么新吗？ Dan(担)Yes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982?是的，我问它们是什么时候发明的。是 a）1606、b）1862 还是 c）1982？ Neil(尼尔)I said 1982.我说的是 1982 年。 Dan(担)Well, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets.嗯，事实上，早在 1862 年，亚伯拉罕·林肯 （Abraham Lincoln） 就在报纸上转载了一篇诙谐的演讲，其中包括一个带有右括号的分号。 Neil(尼尔)Like a winking face?喜欢眨眼的脸？ Dan(担)Exactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error – or what we normally call a typo.完全。尽管人们认为这很遗憾只是一个印刷错误 —— 或者我们通常所说的拼写错误。 Neil(尼尔)A typo – a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly.拼写错误 – 键入速度过快或不小心时出现的拼写错误。 Dan(担)The official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in digital a communication.表情符号的正式诞生通常是在 1982 年，当时一位美国教授指导他的学生使用笑脸来表示笑话 - 在数字交流中。 Neil(尼尔)Wow, so they’re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let’s round up with another look at today’s words.哇，他们都超过 30 岁了。也许我应该开始使用它们。让我们再来看看今天的文字。 Dan(担)Sure. The first word we had was empathy. Do you have a lot of empathy, Neil?确定。我们得到的第一个词是同理心。尼尔，你有很多同理心吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yes, I think I’m quite good at understanding other people’s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It’s important to empathise with your colleagues too.是的，我觉得我很擅长理解别人的感受。无论如何，我的朋友都告诉我！同情你的同事也很重要。 Dan(担)That’s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction.那不是我从你眼里看到的！是的，同理心是所有人类互动的重要组成部分。 Neil(尼尔)Nicely done. If two people interact, it means they ‘communicate with each other and react to each other’. It’s a pretty broad term.干得漂亮。如果两个人互动，这意味着他们“相互交流并相互反应”。这是一个相当宽泛的术语。 Dan(担)We could also talk about how the way children interact with the internet.我们还可以讨论孩子们如何与互联网互动。 Neil(尼尔)Way too much! Next up, we had non-verbal, meaning ‘without spoken language’. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan?太多了！接下来，我们有 non-verbal，意思是 “没有口语”。当我第一次去波兰旅行时，我使用了大量的非语言交流来传达我的信息。手部动作，用手指数数，诸如此类。下一个词，丹？ Dan(担)Next word… that is my cue to say the next word – which is in fact – cue. A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a cue to attack. Or I could give you a cue to… sing a song?下一个词…这就是我说下一个词的提示 —— 实际上是 —— 提示。提示是执行某项作的信号。指挥官可以给他的军官一个攻击的提示。或者我可以给你一个提示……唱歌？ Neil(尼尔)No thanks. I’ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like clumsy – meaning ‘physically awkward’. I’d have to say Dan, you’re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you’re not clumsy at all.不，谢谢。我将继续使用定义词，谢谢。就像笨拙 —— 意思是“身体上的尴尬”。我不得不说丹，你是一个运动型的人，一个有天赋的足球运动员 —— 你一点也不笨拙。 Dan(担)That’s what I thought until I broke my leg – after a clumsy opponent ran into me…我一直这么想，直到我摔断了腿 —— 在一个笨拙的对手撞到我之后…… Neil(尼尔)Ouch. Finally – we had type. No hang on, that’s not right. It should say typo. A typo is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message.哎哟。最后 - 我们有类型。不，等一下，这是不对的。它应该显示 typo。拼写错误是书面文档或数字文件或消息中的错误。 Dan(担)Always check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil. And, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch – and what our lunch choices say about us. So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today? DanAh Neil, are you asking me to join you? I’d love to, thanks. There’s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just… NeilAh, actually – I was just asking to… open up today’s topic. Sorry. You see, I’ve brought a sandwich. DanOh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you’re not the only one – a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch – every day! And yes, it’s mostly sandwiches. NeilI had a curry yesterday. DanWell, it’s almost lunchtime so we’d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it: a) An hour and a halfb) 45 minutes c) 25 minutes NeilOh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I’m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right… just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish. NeilPeckish is a great word isn’t it – it’s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan? DanI am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn’t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches? Bee Wilson, AuthorThey were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of makeshift lunch when you couldn’t get anything better. DanSo – sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals. Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality – a solution you create when you can’t do anything better. NeilI can’t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan. DanThere’s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich – like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there’s no excuse. NeilIf you worked as hard as I did, Dan – you’d only have time for a sandwich! DanWhich is just what Bee Wilson was saying – we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let’s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day. NeilAnd let’s teach one more word first – utilitarian. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive. Julian Baggini, PhilosopherWhat lunch says about us is that we’re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, utilitarian attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything, we haven’t managed to make that an everyday thing – it remains something for the special occasions. NeilSo – he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient – where we have a functional, utilitarian attitude to life. DanExactly, we’re aware of a great food culture, we embrace this culture – but only for special occasions. NeilYes – let’s look at that word embrace. It normally means this… let me just… DanOh Neil, I didn’t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, embraced me. NeilJust as we can embrace physical things and people – we can also embrace ideas. DanHere’s an idea I embrace, Neil. We should all embrace new foods. Broaden our horizons. NeilTo broaden our horizons means ‘to open our minds and experience new things’. DanLet me broaden your horizons right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better team spirit if colleagues eat together. NeilOK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of team spirit – that is – getting on well with team members – having a feeling of belonging. DanFinally. Vietnamese? NeilOh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today’s question. How long do Brits take for lunch? DanWell the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits. Neil25 minutes? It’s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let’s run over the vocab one more time. DanFirst up we had peckish. It means ‘hungry – just a little hungry’. I’m feeling rather peckish at the moment, you? NeilI think I’ve gone beyond peckish, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next? DanWe had makeshift – which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team’s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a makeshift goalie. NeilOr, another example – when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a makeshift drum. DanI’m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word utilitarian? In the context we used it, it means ‘simple and functional, rather than beautiful’. NeilDo you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as utilitarian? DanI prefer classic and timeless. Please. NeilBut enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along. DanOh, are you going to hug me again? To embrace me? NeilNot this time, let’s stick with the metaphorical meaning – ‘to accept a new belief or idea’. DanFor example, I wasn’t sure about the new website design, but now I fully embrace it. NeilVery nice. And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together. DanIt looks like you’ve broadened your horizons. NeilWell, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons and taught me about new ways of life. How about you? DanYes, they say travel broadens the mind – it certainly broadened my horizons too. NeilEven better – why don’t we go travelling together – with the whole Learning English team? DanYeah! That would be wonderful for team spirit –the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia? NeilIt certainly would. And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon, after our delicious lunch! DanAnd we are on social media too. Make sure to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来一个有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和六个非常有用的词汇。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch – and what our lunch choices say about us. So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today?我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论午餐这个可爱的话题 —— 以及我们的午餐选择对我们的影响。那么，Dan，你今天午餐做什么？ Dan(担)Ah Neil, are you asking me to join you? I’d love to, thanks. There’s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just…啊，尼尔，你是要我加入你的吗？我很乐意，谢谢。我们得去看看这个很棒的越南小地方，如果你只是…… Neil(尼尔)Ah, actually – I was just asking to… open up today’s topic. Sorry. You see, I’ve brought a sandwich.啊，实际上 —— 我只是要求……打开今天的话题。不好意思。你看，我带了一个三明治。 Dan(担)Oh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you’re not the only one – a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch – every day! And yes, it’s mostly sandwiches.哦，一个三明治。再！多么沉闷。好吧，你不是唯一一个 —— 2012 年的一项调查显示，三分之一的英国人每天午餐都吃完全相同的东西 —— ！是的，主要是三明治。 Neil(尼尔)I had a curry yesterday.我昨天吃了咖喱。 Dan(担)Well, it’s almost lunchtime so we’d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it:嗯，快到午餐时间了，所以我们最好继续我们的问题，即：英国的平均午休时间有多长？是吗： a) An hour and a half(a）一个半小时)b) 45 minutes c) 25 minutesb） 45 分钟 c） 25 分钟 Neil(尼尔)Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I’m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes哦，我希望这是一个半小时，但我很确定它一定是 c） 25 分钟 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish.好吧，我们会找出你是对的吗……就在午餐前！所有这些关于午餐的讨论实际上让我感到有点饿。 Neil(尼尔)Peckish is a great word isn’t it – it’s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan?Peckish 是个很棒的词，不是吗 —— 这是一个俚语，意思是有点饿。感觉饿了，丹？ Dan(担)I am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn’t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?我现在是。现在，关于你和你的三明治 Neil。两片带馅面包可能是最受欢迎的英国午餐选择，但以前不是这样。听美食作家 Bee Wilson 的话。她用哪个形容词来形容三明治？ Bee Wilson, Author(BeeWilson，作者)They were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of makeshift lunch when you couldn’t get anything better.他们是你在紧急情况下所拥有的。它们是你在长途火车旅行中所拥有的。这是一种临时午餐，当你找不到更好的东西时。 Dan(担)So – sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals. Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality – a solution you create when you can’t do anything better.所以 —— 三明治起源不起眼，是临时餐点。Makeshift 描述了一些临时的、低质量的东西 —— 当你无法做得更好时，你创建的解决方案。 Neil(尼尔)I can’t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan.我不禁觉得这一切都变得有点个人化了，丹。 Dan(担)There’s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich – like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there’s no excuse.吃三明治有时有一个非常实际的理由 —— 就像在火车上一样。不过，在工作日在办公室里，没有任何借口。 Neil(尼尔)If you worked as hard as I did, Dan – you’d only have time for a sandwich!如果你像我一样努力工作，丹 —— 你只有时间吃个三明治了！ Dan(担)Which is just what Bee Wilson was saying – we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let’s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day.这正是 Bee Wilson 所说的 —— 我们将午餐时间视为紧急情况。它说明了我们在英国对工作和食物的态度。接下来，让我们听听哲学家 Julian Baggini 对每天吃同样的东西的看法。 Neil(尼尔)And let’s teach one more word first – utilitarian. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive.让我们先再教一个词 – 功利主义。它描述的是实用和有用的东西，而不是有吸引力的东西。 Julian Baggini, Philosopher(朱利安·巴吉尼，哲学家)What lunch says about us is that we’re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, utilitarian attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything, we haven’t managed to make that an everyday thing – it remains something for the special occasions.午餐告诉我们的是，我们仍然非常受困于这种相当实用、高效、功利的态度，我们应该如何构建我们的日常生活；尽管我们拥抱这种伟大的饮食文化和一切，但我们并没有设法让它成为日常 —— 它仍然是特殊场合的事情。 Neil(尼尔)So – he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient – where we have a functional, utilitarian attitude to life.所以 – 他认为我们生活在一个重视效率的世界 – 我们对生活有一种功能性的、功利主义的态度。 Dan(担)Exactly, we’re aware of a great food culture, we embrace this culture – but only for special occasions.没错，我们知道一种伟大的饮食文化，我们接受这种文化 —— 但仅限于特殊场合。 Neil(尼尔)Yes – let’s look at that word embrace. It normally means this… let me just…是的 - 让我们看看 embrace 这个词。通常的意思是这个…让我就…… Dan(担)Oh Neil, I didn’t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, embraced me.哦，尼尔，我不知道你在乎。尼尔只是拥抱我，搂着我，拥抱我。 Neil(尼尔)Just as we can embrace physical things and people – we can also embrace ideas.正如我们可以拥抱有形的事物和人一样，我们也可以拥抱想法。 Dan(担)Here’s an idea I embrace, Neil. We should all embrace new foods. Broaden our horizons.Neil 先生，我赞同这个想法。我们都应该接受新食物。拓宽我们的视野。 Neil(尼尔)To broaden our horizons means ‘to open our minds and experience new things’.To broading our sight 的意思是“打开我们的思维并体验新事物”。 Dan(担)Let me broaden your horizons right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better team spirit if colleagues eat together.现在让我拓宽你们的视野。康奈尔大学的专家表示，如果同事们一起吃饭，会带来更好的团队精神。 Neil(尼尔)OK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of team spirit – that is – getting on well with team members – having a feeling of belonging.好的，我明白了。我应该扔掉我的三明治，和你一起吃饭。以团队精神的名义 – 也就是说 – 与团队成员相处融洽 – 有归属感。 Dan(担)Finally. Vietnamese?最后。越南语？ Neil(尼尔)Oh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today’s question. How long do Brits take for lunch?哦，是的，但在你告诉我今天问题的答案之前。英国人的午餐需要多长时间？ Dan(担)Well the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits.嗯，答案是 c） 25 分钟。这来自 BBC 今年进行的一项调查，旨在了解我们的现代用餐习惯。 Neil(尼尔)25 minutes? It’s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let’s run over the vocab one more time.25 分钟？真是太可惜了，丹。但在我们自己吃午饭之前，让我们再来一遍这个词汇。 Dan(担)First up we had peckish. It means ‘hungry – just a little hungry’. I’m feeling rather peckish at the moment, you?首先，我们饿了。它的意思是 “饿 – 只是有点饿”。我现在感觉有点饿，你？ Neil(尼尔)I think I’ve gone beyond peckish, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next?我想我已经超越了饥饿，丹。午餐时滚动。下一个？ Dan(担)We had makeshift – which describes a temporary or low quality solution. For example, last week my team’s goalkeeper was sick, so I had to replace him as a makeshift goalie.我们有 makeshift – 它描述了一个临时或低质量的解决方案。例如，上周我们球队的守门员生病了，所以我不得不把他换成临时守门员。 Neil(尼尔)Or, another example – when I was a student I used the steel bin in my room as a makeshift drum.或者，另一个例子 - 当我还是学生时，我用房间里的钢桶作为临时鼓。 Dan(担)I’m sure the neighbours loved that. Now what about this word utilitarian? In the context we used it, it means ‘simple and functional, rather than beautiful’.我相信邻居们都喜欢这样。那么，功利主义这个词呢？在我们使用它的上下文中，它的意思是“简单而实用，而不是美丽”。 Neil(尼尔)Do you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt as utilitarian?你认为用实用主义来形容你的 Polo 衫是公平的吗？ Dan(担)I prefer classic and timeless. Please.我更喜欢经典和永恒。请。 Neil(尼尔)But enough of all this banter. You know, I believe we should all just get along.但这些玩笑已经够了。你知道的，我相信我们都应该和睦相处。 Dan(担)Oh, are you going to hug me again? To embrace me?哦，你又要拥抱我吗？拥抱我？ Neil(尼尔)Not this time, let’s stick with the metaphorical meaning – ‘to accept a new belief or idea’.不是这一次，让我们坚持隐喻的含义 —— “接受一个新的信念或想法”。 Dan(担)For example, I wasn’t sure about the new website design, but now I fully embrace it.例如，我对新网站设计不确定，但现在我完全接受了它。 Neil(尼尔)Very nice. And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together.很好。我接受您的建议，即同事们应该一起吃饭。 Dan(担)It looks like you’ve broadened your horizons.看起来你开阔了视野。 Neil(尼尔)Well, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons and taught me about new ways of life. How about you?当我在西班牙、日本、波兰和捷克共和国教英语时，它真的拓宽了我的视野，教会了我新的生活方式。你怎么样？ Dan(担)Yes, they say travel broadens the mind – it certainly broadened my horizons too.是的，他们说旅行可以开阔我的视野 —— 它当然也开阔了我的视野。 Neil(尼尔)Even better – why don’t we go travelling together – with the whole Learning English team?更棒的是 - 我们为什么不一起去旅行 - 与整个 Learning English 团队一起旅行呢？ Dan(担)Yeah! That would be wonderful for team spirit –the good feeling of being together. Maybe to Cambodia?是的！这对团队精神来说真是太棒了 —— 在一起的感觉很好。也许去柬埔寨？ Neil(尼尔)It certainly would.

I’m Dan… CatherineAnd I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course… DanHow would you like to be a mermaid? CatherineA half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth. DanWell, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer. CatherineI suppose I will. Go on then. DanWhen did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineOk, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine? CatherineWell, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth. DanThey certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example? CatherineMany people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’. DanYes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913. CatherineThere you go! There’s no real evidence. DanWhat if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA? CatherineYou’re telling me fish tales, Dan DanOk. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain. Daniel Craig, mermanA lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident. CatherineSo it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan? DanA real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay. CatherineHang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks. DanThere you go then! CatherineBut there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like? DanWell, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much. Daniel Craig, mermanIt’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway. CatherineSo he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’. DanYes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’. CatherineWell, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question. DanI definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineAnd I said I think it was the 2000s DanAnd you have hit the nail on the head. Well done. CatherineThank you DanYou’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine? CatherineUS President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual? DanWell, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party. CatherineSpooky. DanThe next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’. CatherineNext up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan? DanOne Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine? CatherineTwo weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan? DanMy favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! CatherineAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course…我是 Catherine。在这个节目中，我们将讨论美人鱼，当然还会教你 6 个新的词汇项目…… Dan(担)How would you like to be a mermaid?你想成为美人鱼吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth.半人半鱼？嗯，Dan，我觉得这都是个神话。 Dan(担)Well, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.那么，你会发现本周的问题有点难以回答。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I suppose I will. Go on then.我想我会的。那就继续吧。 Dan(担)When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?最近一次据称目击美人鱼的事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Ok, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.好的，你说的 alleged，你的意思是 ‘说或相信是真的，但未经证实’。我不相信美人鱼，但我认为有很多人相信，所以我会说 c） 2000 年代。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。那么，凯瑟琳，你对美人鱼了解多少呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.嗯，美人鱼是一种外表与女性相似的生物，但美人鱼没有腿，而是有鱼的尾巴。雄性被称为人鱼，它们生活在海洋中。我认为他们是一个神话。 Dan(担)They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?他们肯定是神话般的。他们出现在来自世界各地的传说和故事中。故事中已知最早的可以追溯到公元前 1000 年左右的古亚述。你能想到一个更现代的例子吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’.很多人都熟悉迪斯尼的故事《小美人鱼》。 Dan(担)Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.是的。在成为动画电影之前，它是汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生 （Hans Christian Andersen） 创作的著名童话故事，于 1837 年首次出版。有趣的是，自 1913 年以来，丹麦哥本哈根一直矗立着小美人鱼的小铜像。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)There you go! There’s no real evidence.给你！没有真正的证据。 Dan(担)What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?如果我告诉你，最近有 200 多条美人鱼聚集在美国北卡罗来纳州的格林斯博罗，会怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re telling me fish tales, Dan你在给我讲鱼的故事，丹 Dan(担)Ok. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.好吧，我承认。他们不是真正的美人鱼。每个人都是穿着齐腰高的乳胶尾巴的正常人。他们相聚一堂，分享对水生神话的兴趣，拍摄水下照片和游泳。对于他们中的许多人来说，这也是一个收入来源！听听 Daniel Craig，五年人鱼，解释。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident.我们在这里参加的很多美人鱼都是专业的美人鱼。他们将在生日派对、社交活动、公司活动中娱乐。我偶然发现了美人鱼社区。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan?所以这也是一份工作！一个专业的人鱼。丹尼尔说，他是偶然发现的，或者说是“偶然发现的”。所以，这并不算数，不是吗 Dan？ Dan(担)A real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.一条真正的美人鱼？那是一壶不同的鱼，这是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。好吧，虽然我们没有确凿的证据，例如真正的美人鱼的照片，但已经有几次目击事件。最近的一次是 2009 年在海法湾。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.等一下，这敲响了警钟！那是在以色列，不是吗？据称，它出现在日落时分。显然，美人鱼在耍花招。 Dan(担)There you go then!那你去吧！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?但是，丹，没有理由相信这只是一个骗局，意思是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或有时是残忍”。好吧，无论真实与否，成为美人鱼可能会很有趣。我想知道那会是什么样子？ Dan(担)Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.嗯，我可以帮忙。让 Daniel Craig 解释一下他为什么这么喜欢它。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)It’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway.它只是宁静的。这是临时度假的理想场所。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’.所以他喜欢这里，因为它很宁静，意思是“平静祥和”。 Dan(担)Yes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’.是的，他说这是一个完美的度假胜地，是“一个你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.好吧，我仍然不相信美人鱼，但我确实相信，Dan，你问了我一个问题。 Dan(担)I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?我肯定是这样。我问，最近一次所谓的美人鱼目击事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said I think it was the 2000s我说我认为是 2000 年代 Dan(担)And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.而你已经一针见血了。干的好。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you谢谢 Dan(担)You’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?你是对的。那是 2000 年代。那是 2012 年在津巴布韦，水资源部长报告了这一事件。让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。我们的第一个词是据称。如果某事被指控，它就是 “说或相信是真的，但未被证明是真的”。你能想到最近的一个例子吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）声称报纸一直在刊登假新闻，但显然没有证据。而我们的下一个是偶然发现的。所以，如果你偶然发现了一些东西，你 “偶然遇到或发现它”。这是一个短语动词，你也可以说 come acounter。那么，Dan，你有没有偶然发现过什么不寻常的事情？ Dan(担)Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party.嗯，有一次我要去霍尔本参加一个派对，我完全迷路了。在我面前的地板上，我偶然发现了一张伦敦地图。它让我直接进入了派对。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Spooky.怪异。 Dan(担)The next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’.在那之后的下一个是不同的鱼缸。A different kettle of fish 是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。你也可以使用 ‘a horse of a different colour’ 这个短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Next up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?接下来，我们遇到了骗局。骗局是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或残忍”。丹，你上次做的骗局是什么？ Dan(担)One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine?有一年圣诞节，我把一个坏掉的灯泡装进盒子里，作为礼物送给了妈妈。我假装把它掉了下来，破碎的灯泡发出玻璃破碎的声音，她以为我打破了她的礼物。之后，我们听到了宁静的声音。Serene 的意思是“平静祥和”。名词是 serenity。你对宁静有什么看法，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan?两个星期，躺在沙滩上，喝柠檬水，听着海浪的声音。瑰。最后我们终于逃脱了。逍遥游是一个非正式词，意思是“你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”，例如假期。那么，Dan，你最喜欢的度假胜地在哪里？ Dan(担)My favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!我最喜欢的度假胜地是我的瑜伽课。我觉得这真的非常令人耳目一新。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.我们也在社交媒体上，所以请务必在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上访问我们。 Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】allegedsaid or believed be true but not proven to be true据称据说或相信是真的，但尚未证实The alleged thief was apprehended by the police.据称的小偷被警方逮捕了。 stumbled acrossencountered or found by accident偶然发现偶然遇到或发现While researching my family history, I stumbled across a fascinating old photograph.在我研究家族史时，我偶然发现了一张迷人的旧照片。 a different kettle of fisha completely different matter or issue完全是另一码事完全不同的问题或事情That’s a different kettle of fish; we need a completely different approach.那是另一码事了；我们需要一个完全不同的方法。 hoaxa deception or lie often done for humour or cruelty恶作剧一种欺骗或谎言，通常是为了幽默或残酷The newspaper story turned out to be a hoax.报纸上的新闻报道原来是个骗局。 serenecalm and peaceful宁静的平静而祥和的The serene atmosphere of the countryside calmed my nerves.乡村宁静的氛围使我的神经平静下来。 a getawaya place you go in order to escape from normal life度假胜地你为了逃避正常生活而去的的地方Their secluded cabin in the mountains served as their perfect getaway.他们在山里僻静的小屋是他们完美的度假胜地。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】人类真的能突破90年的界限吗？","path":"/2017/03/02/wechat-2017-03-02/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913. CatherineThere you go! There’s no real evidence. DanWhat if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA? CatherineYou’re telling me fish tales, Dan DanOk. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain. Daniel Craig, mermanA lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident. CatherineSo it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan? DanA real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay. CatherineHang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks. DanThere you go then! CatherineBut there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like? DanWell, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much. Daniel Craig, mermanIt’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway. CatherineSo he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’. DanYes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’. CatherineWell, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question. DanI definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s? CatherineAnd I said I think it was the 2000s DanAnd you have hit the nail on the head. Well done. CatherineThank you DanYou’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine? CatherineUS President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual? DanWell, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party. CatherineSpooky. DanThe next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’. CatherineNext up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan? DanOne Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine? CatherineTwo weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan? DanMy favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! CatherineAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I’m Catherine. In this programme we’ll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course…我是 Catherine。在这个节目中，我们将讨论美人鱼，当然还会教你 6 个新的词汇项目…… Dan(担)How would you like to be a mermaid?你想成为美人鱼吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it’s all a myth.半人半鱼？嗯，Dan，我觉得这都是个神话。 Dan(担)Well, then you’ll find this week’s question a bit of a difficult one to answer.那么，你会发现本周的问题有点难以回答。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)I suppose I will. Go on then.我想我会的。那就继续吧。 Dan(担)When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?最近一次据称目击美人鱼的事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Ok, and by alleged, you mean ‘said or believed to be true but not proven’. I don’t believe in mermaids, but I think there’s a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.好的，你说的 alleged，你的意思是 ‘说或相信是真的，但未经证实’。我不相信美人鱼，但我认为有很多人相信，所以我会说 c） 2000 年代。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。那么，凯瑟琳，你对美人鱼了解多少呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, a mermaid is a creature that’s similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.嗯，美人鱼是一种外表与女性相似的生物，但美人鱼没有腿，而是有鱼的尾巴。雄性被称为人鱼，它们生活在海洋中。我认为他们是一个神话。 Dan(担)They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?他们肯定是神话般的。他们出现在来自世界各地的传说和故事中。故事中已知最早的可以追溯到公元前 1000 年左右的古亚述。你能想到一个更现代的例子吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, ‘The Little Mermaid’.很多人都熟悉迪斯尼的故事《小美人鱼》。 Dan(担)Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.是的。在成为动画电影之前，它是汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生 （Hans Christian Andersen） 创作的著名童话故事，于 1837 年首次出版。有趣的是，自 1913 年以来，丹麦哥本哈根一直矗立着小美人鱼的小铜像。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)There you go! There’s no real evidence.给你！没有真正的证据。 Dan(担)What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?如果我告诉你，最近有 200 多条美人鱼聚集在美国北卡罗来纳州的格林斯博罗，会怎么样？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You’re telling me fish tales, Dan你在给我讲鱼的故事，丹 Dan(担)Ok. I’ll confess. They aren’t real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist- high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it’s a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.好吧，我承认。他们不是真正的美人鱼。每个人都是穿着齐腰高的乳胶尾巴的正常人。他们相聚一堂，分享对水生神话的兴趣，拍摄水下照片和游泳。对于他们中的许多人来说，这也是一个收入来源！听听 Daniel Craig，五年人鱼，解释。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I stumbled across the mermaiding community merely by accident.我们在这里参加的很多美人鱼都是专业的美人鱼。他们将在生日派对、社交活动、公司活动中娱乐。我偶然发现了美人鱼社区。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So it’s a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he stumbled across it, or ‘found it by accident’. So, it doesn’t really count then though, does it Dan?所以这也是一份工作！一个专业的人鱼。丹尼尔说，他是偶然发现的，或者说是“偶然发现的”。所以，这并不算数，不是吗 Dan？ Dan(担)A real, real mermaid? That’s a different kettle of fish, which is an idiomatic phrase that means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.一条真正的美人鱼？那是一壶不同的鱼，这是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。好吧，虽然我们没有确凿的证据，例如真正的美人鱼的照片，但已经有几次目击事件。最近的一次是 2009 年在海法湾。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hang on now, that rings a bell! That’s in Israel, isn’t it? And it allegedly appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.等一下，这敲响了警钟！那是在以色列，不是吗？据称，它出现在日落时分。显然，美人鱼在耍花招。 Dan(担)There you go then!那你去吧！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a hoax, which means ‘a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty’. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?但是，丹，没有理由相信这只是一个骗局，意思是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或有时是残忍”。好吧，无论真实与否，成为美人鱼可能会很有趣。我想知道那会是什么样子？ Dan(担)Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.嗯，我可以帮忙。让 Daniel Craig 解释一下他为什么这么喜欢它。 Daniel Craig, merman(DanielCraig，人鱼)It’s just serene. It’s the perfect place for a temporary getaway.它只是宁静的。这是临时度假的理想场所。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)So he likes it because it’s serene, which means ‘calm and peaceful’.所以他喜欢这里，因为它很宁静，意思是“平静祥和”。 Dan(担)Yes and he says it’s the perfect getaway, which is ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’.是的，他说这是一个完美的度假胜地，是“一个你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I still don’t believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.好吧，我仍然不相信美人鱼，但我确实相信，Dan，你问了我一个问题。 Dan(担)I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?我肯定是这样。我问，最近一次所谓的美人鱼目击事件是什么时候发生的？是 a） 1400 年代 b） 1800 年代还是 c） 2000 年代？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And I said I think it was the 2000s我说我认为是 2000 年代 Dan(担)And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.而你已经一针见血了。干的好。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Thank you谢谢 Dan(担)You’re right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was alleged. If something is alleged it is ‘said or believed be true but not proven to be true’. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?你是对的。那是 2000 年代。那是 2012 年在津巴布韦，水资源部长报告了这一事件。让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。我们的第一个词是据称。如果某事被指控，它就是 “说或相信是真的，但未被证明是真的”。你能想到最近的一个例子吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there’s no proof. And our next one was stumbled across. So, if you stumble across something you ‘encounter or find it by accident’. It’s a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?美国总统唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）声称报纸一直在刊登假新闻，但显然没有证据。而我们的下一个是偶然发现的。所以，如果你偶然发现了一些东西，你 “偶然遇到或发现它”。这是一个短语动词，你也可以说 come acounter。那么，Dan，你有没有偶然发现过什么不寻常的事情？ Dan(担)Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London. It got me straight to the party.嗯，有一次我要去霍尔本参加一个派对，我完全迷路了。在我面前的地板上，我偶然发现了一张伦敦地图。它让我直接进入了派对。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Spooky.怪异。 Dan(担)The next one after that was a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means ‘a completely different matter or issue’. You could also use the phrase ‘a horse of a different colour’.在那之后的下一个是不同的鱼缸。A different kettle of fish 是一个惯用语，意思是“完全不同的事情或问题”。你也可以使用 ‘a horse of a different colour’ 这个短语。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Next up, we had hoax. And a hoax is ‘a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty’. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?接下来，我们遇到了骗局。骗局是“欺骗或谎言 —— 通常是为了幽默或残忍”。丹，你上次做的骗局是什么？ Dan(担)One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard serene. Serene means ‘calm and peaceful’. The noun is serenity. What’s your idea of serene, Catherine?有一年圣诞节，我把一个坏掉的灯泡装进盒子里，作为礼物送给了妈妈。我假装把它掉了下来，破碎的灯泡发出玻璃破碎的声音，她以为我打破了她的礼物。之后，我们听到了宁静的声音。Serene 的意思是“平静祥和”。名词是 serenity。你对宁静有什么看法，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a getaway. A getaway is an informal word meaning ‘a place you go in order to escape from normal life’, such as a holiday. So, where’s your favourite getaway, Dan?两个星期，躺在沙滩上，喝柠檬水，听着海浪的声音。瑰。最后我们终于逃脱了。逍遥游是一个非正式词，意思是“你为了逃离正常生活而去的地方”，例如假期。那么，Dan，你最喜欢的度假胜地在哪里？ Dan(担)My favourite getaway is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!我最喜欢的度假胜地是我的瑜伽课。我觉得这真的非常令人耳目一新。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.我们也在社交媒体上，所以请务必在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上访问我们。 Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】dead on your feetextremely tired筋疲力尽极其疲惫；累得要死He was dead on his feet after the marathon.马拉松比赛后，他累得筋疲力尽。 mottoa short phrase which reflects the beliefs of an organisation or person座右铭反映一个组织或个人的信念的简短格言Our motto is “Quality first”.我们的座右铭是“质量第一”。 life expectancyhow many years a person is likely to live预期寿命一个人可能活多少年Life expectancy in developed countries is increasing.发达国家的预期寿命正在增加。 equitablefair or impartial公平的公平的；公正的It is important to ensure an equitable distribution of resources.确保资源的公平分配非常重要。 obesitya state of being very overweight肥胖症非常超重的状态Obesity is a growing problem in many countries.肥胖症在许多国家日益成为一个严重的问题。 bingeconsume a large amount of something in a short space of time, especially something that you don’t usually have狂欢；放纵在短时间内大量消耗某物，尤其是一些你通常不会有的东西He went on a three-day drinking binge.他连续三天酗酒狂欢。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】什么是没有枪支的枪支管制？","path":"/2017/02/23/wechat-2017-02-23/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course. DanCan we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I’ve got to shoot off to a party later. NeilShoot off meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it’s funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns. DanIs that so? I have a question about that for you. NeilFire away then. DanFire away, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? NeilI’m going to guess b) Iceland, just because I’ve never been there. DanWell, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket? NeilIt’s got to be a gun. DanWell, in most countries in the world you’d be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon – which is a kind of blanket – and they wrap them up and restrain them, or prevent them from moving. NeilYou’re pulling my leg. DanNope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation: Anthony Berteaux, Japanese JournalistWhat most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it’s always to de-escalate it. NeilSo, they safely restrain the person and wait for the situation to de-escalate, or become less intense. DanUnless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons. NeilSurely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then? DanYou’d think so, but no. It seems that guns don’t really feature in crimes much in Japan. NeilWell, that’s astonishing. So do you think the criminals don’t carry guns because the police don’t carry guns or that the police don’t carry guns because the criminals don’t carry guns? DanWow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don’t know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society. Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed ViolenceThe American model has been militarise the police, but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society. And I’m very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals. NeilSo, America tends to militarise its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army… Dan…and that causes an arms race with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group. NeilHe also said that there’s not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful? DanWell, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked? NeilI think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland. DanWell, I’m sorry Neil, that’s not right. But, don’t shoot the messenger, OK? It’s Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685. NeilHow interesting. Now, let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. DanSure, we had shoot off. If you shoot off, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example? NeilIt’s a phrasal verb so it’s used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, he shot off to the hospital. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had fire away. Now, fire away is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question? DanI’d say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. Restrain. If you restrain someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might restrain yourself from doing something – for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to restrain your children from anything, Neil? NeilI have to restrain my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and restrain them. OK, de-escalate – If something de-escalates, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan? DanWell, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises escalated over a period of two weeks and de- escalated only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! Militarise. If something is militarised, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become militarised, Neil. NeilYes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service – that’s join the army for a couple of years – so they became militarised. Now, an arms race. An arms race is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan? DanThe most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an arms race to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon! NeilAnd we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论武装警察，当然也会教你六项新的词汇。 Dan(担)Can we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I’ve got to shoot off to a party later.我们今天能快点完成这件事吗，Neil？只是我得稍后去参加一个派对。 Neil(尼尔)Shoot off meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it’s funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns.Shoot off 意味着快速离开。我们当然可以。有趣的是，你应该提到射击，因为我们本周的主题是没有枪支的枪支管制。 Dan(担)Is that so? I have a question about that for you.是吗？我有一个问题要问你。 Neil(尼尔)Fire away then.然后开火。 Dan(担)Fire away, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan?fire away，允许某人提出问题或发言的表达式。那么，哪个国家的枪支管制法律是世界上最古老的呢？是 a） 美国，b） 冰岛还是 c） 日本？ Neil(尼尔)I’m going to guess b) Iceland, just because I’ve never been there.我猜 b） 冰岛，只是因为我从来没有去过那里。 Dan(担)Well, we’ll find out if you’re right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket?好吧，我们稍后会发现你是对的。现在，想象一下这个场景。您是一名警察，被派去处理一起事件。当你到达现场时，你发现了一个危险的罪犯。你伸手去拿枪还是毯子？ Neil(尼尔)It’s got to be a gun.它必须是一把枪。 Dan(担)Well, in most countries in the world you’d be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon – which is a kind of blanket – and they wrap them up and restrain them, or prevent them from moving.嗯，在世界上大多数国家你都是对的，但在日本不是。尽管日本警察携带枪支，但几乎从不使用枪支。相反，他们依靠武术的组合，在许多情况下，当一个人有暴力行为时，他们会拿出被褥 —— 这是一种毯子 —— 然后把他们裹起来，束缚他们，或阻止他们移动。 Neil(尼尔)You’re pulling my leg.你在拉我的腿。 Dan(担)Nope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation:不！听听日本记者 Anthony Berteaux 描述这种情况： Anthony Berteaux, Japanese Journalist(AnthonyBerteaux，日本记者)What most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it’s always to de-escalate it.大多数日本警察会做的是弄来巨大的被褥，基本上把施暴或喝醉的人卷进一个小墨西哥卷饼里，把他们带回警察局，让他们冷静下来。对暴力的反应从来都不是暴力，而是总是缓和暴力。 Neil(尼尔)So, they safely restrain the person and wait for the situation to de-escalate, or become less intense.因此，他们安全地控制住这个人，并等待情况缓和或变得不那么激烈。 Dan(担)Unless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons.除非罪犯有枪，否则日本警察从不开枪。 Neil(尼尔)Surely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then?这肯定意味着罪犯总是占优势吗？ Dan(担)You’d think so, but no. It seems that guns don’t really feature in crimes much in Japan.你可能会这么认为，但不是。在日本，枪支似乎并不真正出现在犯罪中。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s astonishing. So do you think the criminals don’t carry guns because the police don’t carry guns or that the police don’t carry guns because the criminals don’t carry guns?嗯，这太令人惊讶了。那么，您认为罪犯不携带枪支是因为警察不携带枪支，还是因为罪犯不携带枪支而警察不携带枪支？ Dan(担)Wow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don’t know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society.哇，真让我头疼！好吧，我不知道，但请听听武装暴力行动组织执行主任伊恩·奥弗顿 （Iain Overton） 对社会武装警察的看法。 Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence(伊恩·奥弗顿（IainOverton），武装暴力行动组织执行主任)The American model has been militarise the police, but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society. And I’m very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals.美国的模式是将警察军事化，但我面临的挑战是，几乎没有证据表明警察更加军事化会带来一个更和平的社会。我非常担心，如果有太多警察在第一次犯罪时拔枪，那么会导致警察和罪犯之间的小型军备竞赛。 Neil(尼尔)So, America tends to militarise its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army…所以，美国倾向于将其警察军事化，以装备他们并把他们当作军队来使用…… Dan(担)…and that causes an arms race with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group.…这会导致与罪犯的军备竞赛，这是两个群体之间争夺比另一个群体拥有更多武器的竞争。 Neil(尼尔)He also said that there’s not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful?他还表示，武装警察与和平社会之间没有很强的联系。那么，这是否意味着日本社会更加和平呢？ Dan(担)Well, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked?好吧，那里仍然发生暴力犯罪，但罪犯往往携带其他武器，例如剑和刀，但至少这是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。现在，您还记得我问的测验问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)I think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland.我认为如此。你问我哪个国家的枪支管制法律是世界上最古老的？是 a） 美国，b） 冰岛还是 c） 日本？我说 b） 冰岛。 Dan(担)Well, I’m sorry Neil, that’s not right. But, don’t shoot the messenger, OK? It’s Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685.好吧，对不起，尼尔，这不对。但是，不要向信使开枪，好吗？日本于 1685 年实施了枪支管制法。 Neil(尼尔)How interesting. Now, let’s take a look at the vocabulary from this programme.真有趣。现在，让我们来看看这个程序的词汇。 Dan(担)Sure, we had shoot off. If you shoot off, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example?当然，我们已经开枪了。如果你开枪，那就意味着你匆忙离开某个地方。尼尔是什么类型的动词？您能给我们举个例子吗？ Neil(尼尔)It’s a phrasal verb so it’s used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, he shot off to the hospital. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had fire away. Now, fire away is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question?它是一个短语动词，因此在对话中使用，通常在非正式上下文中使用。举个例子，当他听说妻子生病时，他立即赶往医院。同义词可以是 dash off 或 run off。接下来我们把火烧走了。现在，fire away 是一个允许某人提出问题或发言的表达式。Dan，你能想到其他方式来表达同样的事情吗，如果我说，我可以问你一个问题吗？ Dan(担)I’d say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. Restrain. If you restrain someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might restrain yourself from doing something – for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to restrain your children from anything, Neil?我会说是的，当然，去吧，请这样做，或者一定要这样做。抑制。如果你约束某人，你就阻止他们移动。从另一种意义上说，你可能会克制自己做某事 —— 例如：吃巧克力！尼尔，你有没有不得不约束你的孩子做任何事情？ Neil(尼尔)I have to restrain my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and restrain them. OK, de-escalate – If something de-escalates, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan?我必须一直约束我的孩子，丹，否则他们会疯狂地打架。我必须把他们拉开并约束他们。好的，降级 – 如果某件事降级，它会变得不那么激烈。这通常用于冲突或争论的上下文中。丹，你能想出一个历史上的例子吗？ Dan(担)Well, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises escalated over a period of two weeks and de- escalated only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! Militarise. If something is militarised, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become militarised, Neil.嗯，在 1960 年代，古巴导弹危机在两周内升级，只有在外交谈判成功后才有所缓和。但它一度非常接近第三次世界大战！军事化。如果某物是军事化的，它就会像军队一样装备和使用。给我举个军事化的例子吧，尼尔。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service – that’s join the army for a couple of years – so they became militarised. Now, an arms race. An arms race is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan?是的，当我在英国读书时，一些外国学生不得不回国参加国民服役 —— 也就是参军几年 —— 所以他们变得军事化了。现在，一场军备竞赛。军备竞赛是两组人之间为了获得比另一组人更多的武器而进行的比赛。有个例子吗，Dan？ Dan(担)The most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an arms race to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!最著名的例子是冷战。苏联和美国都卷入了一场军备竞赛，以尽可能多地储存核武器。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Neil(尼尔)And we are on social media too, so make sure to visit us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.我们也在社交媒体上，所以请务必在 Facebook、Twitter、Instagram 和 YouTube 上访问我们。 Both(双)Bye!再见！ 【核心词汇】to shoot offto leave somewhere in a hurry匆匆离开to leave somewhere quickly and suddenly.He shot off to catch the train.他赶紧跑着去赶火车。 fire awayan expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak.尽管问吧Go ahead and ask your questions or say what you want to say.Fire away, I’m all ears.尽管问，我洗耳恭听。 restrainprevent someone from moving阻止to prevent someone or something from doing something or from moving.Police struggled to restrain the angry protesters.警方努力控制住愤怒的抗议者。 de-escalatebecome less intense降级to make something less intense or serious.The situation de-escalated after a period of intense negotiations.经过一段时间的紧张谈判，局势有所缓和。 militariseto equip or use something or someone like an army军事化to equip or organize something or someone for military purposes.The government is accused of militarising the police force.政府被指控将警察部队军事化。 arms racea competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group军备竞赛a competition between countries to have more and better weapons than each other.The Cold War was characterized by a dangerous arms race between the US and the Soviet Union.冷战的特点是美国和苏联之间危险的军备竞赛。 在公众号里输入6位数字，获取【对话音频、英文文本、中文翻译、核心词汇和高级词汇表】电子档，6位数字【暗号】在文章的最后一张图片，如【220728】，表示22年7月28日这一期。公众号没有的文章说明还没有制作相关资料。年度合集在B站【六分钟英语】工房获取，每年共计300+文档，感谢支持！","tags":["六分钟英语"],"categories":["六分钟英语"]},{"title":"【BBC六分钟英语】浪漫怎么会毁了爱情？","path":"/2017/02/16/wechat-2017-02-16/","content":"【英文脚本】DanHello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan… NeilAnd I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing romance, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course. Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset? DanOh Neil, it’s all over! She broke up with me on Valentine’s Day! She said I wasn’t the one. NeilCheer up Dan, cheer up. It’s not your fault. DanNo? NeilYou can blame romanticism. DanRomanticism? What’s that? NeilRomanticism was a movement that started in Europe and spread worldwide. It influenced literature, art, poetry, music and the way people behaved. DanA movement meaning ‘a group of people working together to support an idea’? NeilYes. And that bring us on to this week’s question. When was the start of the romantic period? Was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18thth century or c) the end of the 18th century? DanWell, I honestly have no idea, so I’m going to go smack in the middle… the middle of the 18th century. NeilAnd we’ll find out later on in the show if you got the question right. Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend, let me take a wild guess… love at first sight, was it? DanWell… yes. What’s your point? NeilWell, it’s not your fault, Dan. That idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the zeitgeist, and many of these ideas still continue today. DanZeitgeist, the word comes from German and literally means ‘the spirit of the time’. NeilA lot of what we believe about love today – for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after - comes from the romantic period. DanBut, everyone loves a bit of romance! NeilWell, that’s true. However, it’s one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals. DanTrue, it might not be a realistic benchmark, and by that I mean ‘a standard from which other things are judged’. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be…and then we get disappointed by the real thing? NeilWell, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty, meaning ‘practical details’. Details like work, stress, children…all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life. DanNot to mention, the fact that everyone is flawed, or ‘imperfect’, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons. NeilExactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work. DanAnd if the relationship you are in isn’t as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you’re with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that’s true for everyone’s relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them. NeilWell, I asked these people about theirs… INSERTIs your partner 100% perfect for you? No. Not 100%. No, I don’t think that’s true. DanDoes that mean true love doesn’t exist? NeilNo. It just means that all relationships must be worked on and that perfection is impossible. But we should never give up trying. DanYou’re right! She wasn’t the one for me! I need to find my next Juliet. She’ll be just perfect! NeilOh Dan. You haven’t learnt anything! You’re just a hopeless romantic. Now, can you remember the quiz question? I asked you when the Romantic period originated? Was it a) th th th the beginning of the 18 century, b) the middle of the 18 century or c) the end of the 18 century? DanAnd I said: the middle of the 18th century. NeilWrong I’m afraid! It was towards the end of the 18th century. DanI have nothing good in my life at the moment. NeilShall we take a look at the vocabulary too? DanSure. The first word we had was: movement – a movement is a ‘group of people working together to support an idea’. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil? NeilThe environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the movement for equality – gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was zeitgeist – now, a zeitgeist literally means ‘the spirit of a particular time’. What would you say that the zeitgeist is these days, Dan? DanWell, I think there’s a focus on personal freedom. There’s environmental concern, and of course, let’s not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was benchmark – a benchmark is a ‘standard from which other things are judged’. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be? NeilWell, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the benchmark for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have: idealised – an idealised thing is an ‘often imagined, perfect version’ of something. Now, what three things would exist in an idealised world for you then, Dan? DanI would say, personal freedom, religious tolerance and free ice-cream for everybody on a daily basis. NeilBrilliant! OK! DanNext we have nitty-gritty – the nitty-gritty is the ‘important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing’. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the nitty-gritty of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples! NeilWell, you have to decide who’s going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food - some people don’t like this, some people don’t like that. You’ve got to get the flowers right. Oh, there’s so much to think about – makes you think that marriage might be flawed… and flawed – is a thing which is ‘imperfect in some way’. London’s a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan? DanWell, I think it’s flawed in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade – there’s never enough space on the carriages. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Dan(担)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I’m Dan…您好，欢迎来到六分钟英语 - 该节目为您带来有趣的话题、真实的听力练习和词汇，帮助您提高语言技能。我是 Dan… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing romance, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course. Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset?我是 Neil。在这个节目中，我们将讨论浪漫，当然也会教你 6 个新的词汇。现在，丹，你为什么看起来这么难过？ Dan(担)Oh Neil, it’s all over! She broke up with me on Valentine’s Day! She said I wasn’t the one.哦，尼尔，一切都结束了！她在情人节那天和我分手了！她说我不是那个人。 Neil(尼尔)Cheer up Dan, cheer up. It’s not your fault.振作起来，丹，振作起来。这不是你的错。 Dan(担)No?不？ Neil(尼尔)You can blame romanticism.你可以责怪浪漫主义。 Dan(担)Romanticism? What’s that?浪漫主义？什么？ Neil(尼尔)Romanticism was a movement that started in Europe and spread worldwide. It influenced literature, art, poetry, music and the way people behaved.浪漫主义是一场起源于欧洲并传播到全世界的运动。它影响了文学、艺术、诗歌、音乐和人们的行为方式。 Dan(担)A movement meaning ‘a group of people working together to support an idea’?一个运动的意思是“一群人一起努力支持一个想法”？ Neil(尼尔)Yes. And that bring us on to this week’s question. When was the start of the romantic period? Was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18thth century or c) the end of the 18th century?是的。这让我们进入了本周的问题。浪漫时期是从什么时候开始的？是 a） 18 世纪初，b） 18 世纪中叶还是 c） 18 世纪末？ Dan(担)Well, I honestly have no idea, so I’m going to go smack in the middle… the middle of the 18th century.好吧，老实说我不知道，所以我要去中间打……18 世纪中叶。 Neil(尼尔)And we’ll find out later on in the show if you got the question right. Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend, let me take a wild guess… love at first sight, was it?我们稍后会在节目中发现您是否回答正确。现在，回到你的前女友，让我大胆猜测一下……一见钟情，是吗？ Dan(担)Well… yes. What’s your point?井。。。是的。你的意思是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it’s not your fault, Dan. That idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the zeitgeist, and many of these ideas still continue today.好吧，这不是你的错，丹。这个想法很浪漫，我的意思是它起源于浪漫主义时代。这是时代精神的一部分，其中许多想法今天仍在继续。 Dan(担)Zeitgeist, the word comes from German and literally means ‘the spirit of the time’.Zeitgeist，这个词来自德语，字面意思是“时代精神”。 Neil(尼尔)A lot of what we believe about love today – for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after - comes from the romantic period.我们今天对爱情的很多信念 —— 例如，两个人会从此幸福生活的想法 —— 都来自浪漫时期。 Dan(担)But, everyone loves a bit of romance!但是，每个人都喜欢一点浪漫！ Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s true. However, it’s one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals.嗯，这是真的。然而，享受浪漫是一回事，但根据浪漫理想来评判你们的关系可能是危险的。 Dan(担)True, it might not be a realistic benchmark, and by that I mean ‘a standard from which other things are judged’. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be…and then we get disappointed by the real thing?诚然，它可能不是一个现实的基准，我的意思是“评判其他事物的标准”。所以我们从小就听着这些浪漫的故事长大，这让我们对一段关系的意义产生了一种观念……然后我们对真实的东西感到失望？ Neil(尼尔)Well, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty, meaning ‘practical details’. Details like work, stress, children…all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life.嗯，坦率地说，是的。浪漫的理想就是这样 —— 一段关系的理想化版本，或完美版本。但它往往忽略了细节，即“实际细节”。工作、压力、孩子等细节……我们在日常生活中必须处理的所有事情。 Dan(担)Not to mention, the fact that everyone is flawed, or ‘imperfect’, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons.更不用说，每个人都以自己的方式存在缺陷或“不完美”的事实。这意味着我们会因为各种原因而生气、喜怒无常或不安。 Neil(尼尔)Exactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work.完全！许多流行的爱情故事以人物聚在一起或结婚结束。但很少有人向我们展示如何让这个人长期保持特别。一段关系是一项艰苦的工作。 Dan(担)And if the relationship you are in isn’t as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you’re with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that’s true for everyone’s relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them.如果你的关系并不像故事所说的那么完美，那么也许你和错误的人在一起了，这可以解释为什么这么多婚姻以离婚告终。我想知道每个人的关系是否都是如此。幸运的是，我找到了一些有伴侣的人并询问了他们。 Neil(尼尔)Well, I asked these people about theirs…好吧，我问了这些人关于他们的…… INSERT(插入)Is your partner 100% perfect for you? No. Not 100%. No, I don’t think that’s true.您的伴侣 100% 适合您吗？不。不是 100%。不，我不认为这是真的。 Dan(担)Does that mean true love doesn’t exist?这是否意味着真爱不存在？ Neil(尼尔)No. It just means that all relationships must be worked on and that perfection is impossible. But we should never give up trying.不。它只是意味着所有的关系都必须努力，完美是不可能的。但我们永远不应该放弃尝试。 Dan(担)You’re right! She wasn’t the one for me! I need to find my next Juliet. She’ll be just perfect!你是对的！她不是适合我的那个人！我需要找到我的下一个朱丽叶。她会完美无缺！ Neil(尼尔)Oh Dan. You haven’t learnt anything! You’re just a hopeless romantic. Now, can you remember the quiz question? I asked you when the Romantic period originated? Was it a) th th th the beginning of the 18 century, b) the middle of the 18 century or c) the end of the 18 century?哦，丹。你什么都没学到！你只是一个无可救药的浪漫主义者。现在，您记得测验问题吗？我问你浪漫主义时期是什么时候起源的？是 a） 18 世纪初，b） 18 世纪中叶还是 c） 18 世纪末？ Dan(担)And I said: the middle of the 18th century.我说：18 世纪中叶。 Neil(尼尔)Wrong I’m afraid! It was towards the end of the 18th century.恐怕错了！那是在 18 世纪末。 Dan(担)I have nothing good in my life at the moment.我现在的生活没有什么好东西。 Neil(尼尔)Shall we take a look at the vocabulary too?我们也要看看这些词汇吗？ Dan(担)Sure. The first word we had was: movement – a movement is a ‘group of people working together to support an idea’. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil?确定。我们得到的第一个词是：运动 – 运动是“一群人共同努力支持一个想法”。Neil，你能想到任何现代的运动吗？ Neil(尼尔)The environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the movement for equality – gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was zeitgeist – now, a zeitgeist literally means ‘the spirit of a particular time’. What would you say that the zeitgeist is these days, Dan?目前，环保运动非常强大和受欢迎，平等运动也是如此 —— 例如性别平等。“我们得到的下一个词是 zeitgeist —— 现在，zeitgeist 的字面意思是”特定时代的精神”。Dan，你认为现在的时代精神是什么？ Dan(担)Well, I think there’s a focus on personal freedom. There’s environmental concern, and of course, let’s not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was benchmark – a benchmark is a ‘standard from which other things are judged’. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be?嗯，我认为人们关注的是个人自由。这里有环境问题，当然，我们不要忘记社交媒体的兴起。我们得到的下一个词是 benchmark – benchmark 是“评判其他事物的标准”。如果你在找新房子，Neil，你的基准是什么？ Neil(尼尔)Well, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the benchmark for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have: idealised – an idealised thing is an ‘often imagined, perfect version’ of something. Now, what three things would exist in an idealised world for you then, Dan?嗯，我现在的房子有一个花园，有我可以停车的地方，所以这将是新房子的基准。它至少必须有这个，甚至更多。接下来我们有：理想化 – 理想化的事物是某物的“经常想象的完美版本”。那么，Dan，在你的理想化世界中会存在哪三样东西呢？ Dan(担)I would say, personal freedom, religious tolerance and free ice-cream for everybody on a daily basis.我想说的是，个人自由、宗教宽容和每天为每个人提供免费的冰淇淋。 Neil(尼尔)Brilliant! OK!明！还行！ Dan(担)Next we have nitty-gritty – the nitty-gritty is the ‘important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing’. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the nitty-gritty of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples!接下来我们有了细节 —— 细节是“情况或事物中涉及的重要或实际细节”。现在，结婚应该是一件美妙的事情，但仪式的细节呢，尼尔。请给我们举几个例子！ Neil(尼尔)Well, you have to decide who’s going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food - some people don’t like this, some people don’t like that. You’ve got to get the flowers right. Oh, there’s so much to think about – makes you think that marriage might be flawed… and flawed – is a thing which is ‘imperfect in some way’. London’s a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan?嗯，你必须决定谁坐在谁旁边，邀请谁，食物 - 有些人不喜欢这个，有些人不喜欢那个。你得把花弄对。哦，有太多事情要考虑 – 让你觉得婚姻可能有缺陷……和 flawed – 是“在某种程度上不完美”的事物。伦敦是个很棒的城市，但你觉得怎么样，Dan？ Dan(担)Well, I think it’s flawed in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade – there’s never enough space on the carriages. Well, that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!嗯，我认为公共交通使用升级的方式是有缺陷的 —— 车厢上永远没有足够的空间。好了，今天的六分钟 English 到此结束。请尽快再次加入我们！ Neil(尼尔)And we are on social media too.

I’m Catherine… NeilAnd I’m Neil. CatherineSo, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today? NeilHave you done your hair differently? CatherineNo. NeilIs that a new outfit? CatherineHonestly, Neil! NeilI give up. I don’t know what’s different about you. CatherineOK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you’ll have figured it out. Anyway, today we’re discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today’s quiz question, Neil? NeilI am. CatherineOK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum? NeilWell, I have no idea. But I’ll say a) the temporal lobe. CatherineOK and we’ll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let’s talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn’t work like that. It’s a reconstructive process. NeilA reconstructive process? CatherineYes. We reconstruct - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be distorted – or changed – for different reasons. Let’s listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College at the University of London, talking about this. Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College, University of LondonFrom all those TV dramas you’ve watched you’ll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don’t introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don’t distort their memory. NeilSo crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don’t contaminate it with their DNA. CatherineThat’s right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means ‘made impure through contact with an outside source’. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can’t get back to the original information. NeilNow, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness’s memory of what happened. CatherineAnd it isn’t only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you’re being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker’s face. And at knifepoint means ‘under threat of being stabbed’. NeilSo why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts? CatherineEyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New YorkFirst, I think it’s sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It’s disconcerting to think that we’re going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be – and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it. NeilSo we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it’s disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And disconcerting means… Catherine…it means ‘confusing and a bit upsetting’. NeilKaren Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness testimony – or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that’s true, Catherine? CatherineYes – and it’s the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate. NeilAre there any ways to improve accuracy? CatherineYes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response. NeilYes, I see. Well, you didn’t give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show. CatherineYes, that’s true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that… I’m wearing glasses, Neil. I’ve lost my contact lenses! NeilI don’t know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses. CatherineJust a bit, yes. So, now we’re running out of time, so let’s move onto the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum? NeilI said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right? CatherineYou were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer! NeilYes! CatherineThe main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area – is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area behind your ears. NeilFascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today… reconstruct distorted crime scene contaminated at knifepoint disconcerting testimony CatherineAnd that bring us to the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum?还行。那么，大脑的哪个部分有专门用于记住面孔的区域呢？是吗。。。a） 颞叶？b） 下丘脑？或 c） 小脑？ Neil(尼尔)Well, I have no idea. But I’ll say a) the temporal lobe.嗯，我不知道。但我要说的是 a） 颞叶。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)OK and we’ll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let’s talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn’t work like that. It’s a reconstructive process.好的，我们将在稍后的节目中找出您是否选择了正确的答案。但是，让我们更多地谈谈我们的记忆是如何欺骗我们的。我们倾向于认为记忆就像一个录像机，我们可以一遍又一遍地重播和回忆它最初发生的情况。但记忆不是那样工作的。这是一个重建的过程。 Neil(尼尔)A reconstructive process?重建过程？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes. We reconstruct - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be distorted – or changed – for different reasons. Let’s listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College at the University of London, talking about this.是的。我们重建或重建记忆，在此过程中，它们可能会因不同的原因而被扭曲或更改。让我们听听伦敦大学金史密斯学院 （Goldsmith’s College at the University of London） 退休心理学教授蒂姆·瓦伦丁 （Tim Valentine） 谈论这个问题。 Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith’s College, University of London(蒂姆·瓦伦丁（TimValentine），伦敦大学金史密斯学院（Goldsmith’sCollege，UniversityofLondon）退休心理学教授)From all those TV dramas you’ve watched you’ll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don’t introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don’t distort their memory.从你看过的所有电视剧中，你会熟悉犯罪警察穿着纸制西装，遮住鞋子和头发的法医现场，以确保他们不会将自己的 DNA 或物理痕迹引入犯罪现场。因此，任何与证人互动的人都需要确保他们不会扭曲自己的记忆。 Neil(尼尔)So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don’t contaminate it with their DNA.因此，犯罪警察在犯罪现场穿着防护服，这样他们就不会用 DNA 污染它。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means ‘made impure through contact with an outside source’. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can’t get back to the original information.没错。犯罪现场是犯罪发生的地方。而 infected 的意思是“通过与外部来源接触而变得不纯”。因此，例如，如果警官在没有戴手套的情况下触摸某物，他们就会引入新信息。一旦发生这种情况，您将无法返回原始信息。 Neil(尼尔)Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness’s memory of what happened.现在，蒂姆·瓦伦丁 （Tim Valentine） 说，当警察与犯罪证人交谈时，他们也可能会引入新的信息。这可能会改变证人对所发生的事情的记忆。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And it isn’t only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you’re being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker’s face. And at knifepoint means ‘under threat of being stabbed’.而且，不仅仅是警察的审问会扭曲记忆。其他因素（如压力）会影响您准确回忆事件的能力。例如，如果您被持刀指着，您很可能专注于武器而不是攻击者的脸。而 at knifepoint 的意思是“受到被刺伤的威胁”。 Neil(尼尔)So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?那么，为什么我们如此重视目击者的陈述呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further.目击者的陈述在法庭上听起来非常有说服力 —— 但事实上，根据研究，它们往往不可靠。纽约 Innocence Project 的高级律师 Karen Newirth 进一步解释了这一点。 Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York(KarenNewirth，纽约InnocenceProject高级律师)First, I think it’s sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It’s disconcerting to think that we’re going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be – and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.首先，我认为人们想要相信记忆可以是准确的是很自然的。想到我们一生中都依赖我们的记忆，然后了解它们可能有多么错误 —— 以及它们有多频繁，这令人不安。其次，目击者的证词已经成为一项非常令人期待的刑事审判，因此陪审员们在某种程度上预料到它，寻找它，并倾向于相信它。 Neil(尼尔)So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it’s disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And disconcerting means…因此，我们愿意相信我们能够准确记住事物。得知记忆经常不准确，这令人不安。而令人不安的意思是…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)…it means ‘confusing and a bit upsetting’.…它的意思是“令人困惑和有点不安”。 Neil(尼尔)Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness testimony – or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that’s true, Catherine?Karen Newirth 还表示，人们期待在法庭上看到目击者的证词或口头陈述。你认为这是真的吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes – and it’s the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate.是的 - 这是在法庭上针对刑事被告提出的最常用的证据，尽管它们通常不准确。 Neil(尼尔)Are there any ways to improve accuracy?有什么方法可以提高准确性吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.是的，有。例如，在警察阵容中，您可以阻止目击者从发出指示的警官那里接收信息，这可能会影响他们的反应。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, I see. Well, you didn’t give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show.是的，我明白了。好吧，当你在节目开始时问你的外表有什么不同时，你没有透露任何东西。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yes, that’s true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that… I’m wearing glasses, Neil. I’ve lost my contact lenses!是的，这是真的，尼尔。但我现在可以向你透露……我戴着眼镜，Neil。我的隐形眼镜丢了！ Neil(尼尔)I don’t know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.我不知道我是怎么错过的。因为实际上你戴眼镜看起来确实完全不同。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Just a bit, yes. So, now we’re running out of time, so let’s move onto the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it… a) the temporal lobe? b) the hypothalamus? or c) the cerebellum?只是一点点，是的。所以，现在我们的时间不多了，所以让我们继续回答今天的测验问题。记得我问过：大脑的哪个部分有专门用于识别面孔的区域？是吗。。。a） 颞叶？b） 下丘脑？或 c） 小脑？ Neil(尼尔)I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?我说的是 a） 颞叶。我是对的吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!你确实是，尼尔！做得非常好，这是正确的答案！ Neil(尼尔)Yes!是的！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area – is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area behind your ears.大脑中专门用于识别面孔的主要部分 —— 称为梭形面区域 —— 位于颞叶，大致位于耳后区域。 Neil(尼尔)Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today… reconstruct distorted crime scene contaminated at knifepoint disconcerting testimony迷人！现在，这是我们今天学到的单词……重建被刀指着污染的扭曲犯罪现场令人不安的证词 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that bring us to the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Catherine… NeilAnd I’m Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning! CatherineNo, really? NeilYeah. CatherineWow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don’t know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say? NeilWell, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London – something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone. CatherineWhich is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil. NeilYes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking… if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don’t I – and other commuters in the city – do it more often? CatherineWell, that’s a good question, Neil, and maybe we’ll find some answers in the show, because today we’re talking about why cities make us so rude. And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin? NeilI don’t know, but I’m going to say a) melatonin. CatherineWell, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called ‘Talk to me London’ has created these ‘Tubechat’ badges that you can wear to show that you’re happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one! NeilYeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don’t know what might happen. CatherineThat’s true. Now, let’s listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places. Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UKWhen we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us – we’re just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We’re persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It’s a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we’re going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other. CatherineDr Elle Boag there. And hyper vigilance means being extremely watchful of what’s going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you’re just one person in a crowd of others and you just don’t know who might be dangerous. NeilYeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour. CatherineThat’s right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become insular – which means inward looking. NeilIt sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous – to blend in with the crowd – and not have to talk to people! CatherineWell, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic – which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can’t do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours. NeilAnd a nosey person shows too much interest in other people’s business. CatherineNow, it’s good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it’s not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting – it’s about efficiency – getting to work on time, getting things done. Let’s hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this. Thomas Farley, writer and broadcasterThe cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it’s a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don’t have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it’s not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose – it’s simply that people have a destination to be. NeilSo what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine? CatherineSuccess quotient means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients. NeilCities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine? CatherineI don’t think we hustle, Neil. Hustle means to work aggressively to make money. NeilWe do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And chitchat, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That’s what we do! CatherineWhat we do isn’t chitchat, Neil! It’s highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today’s quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin? NeilAnd it’s a) melatonin – I’m absolutely sure. CatherineSorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin – a hormone commonly known as the ‘love drug’. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment. NeilNow, here are the words we learned today: hyper vigilance insular claustrophobic nosey quotient hustle chitchat CatherineThat’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to join us again soon! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine…您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning!我是 Neil。你知道吗，凯瑟琳，今天早上有人在地铁上和我说话了！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)No, really?不，真的吗？ Neil(尼尔)Yeah.是的。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Wow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don’t know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say?哇！我也许应该指出，在地铁上与你不认识的人交谈在伦敦是相当不寻常的行为！那么，尼尔，他们怎么说呢？ Neil(尼尔)Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London – something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone.嗯，他们说今天是多么美好的一天，很高兴看到阳光明媚地照耀着伦敦 —— 类似这样。但实际上，聊天而不是皱着眉头坐在那里摆弄我的手机是件好事。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Which is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil.尼尔，你可能总是这样做来在公共交通工具上打发时间。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking… if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don’t I – and other commuters in the city – do it more often?是的，是的 - 我和其他成千上万的人。但这让我思考……如果在上班路上与人交谈让我感觉更好，那么我和城市中的其他通勤者为什么不更频繁地交谈呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, that’s a good question, Neil, and maybe we’ll find some answers in the show, because today we’re talking about why cities make us so rude. And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin?嗯，这是个好问题，Neil，也许我们会在节目中找到一些答案，因为今天我们要讨论的是为什么城市让我们如此粗鲁。我有一个问题要问你：当我们与某人进行积极的互动时，我们的身体会释放一种化学物质。但是这种化学物质叫什么名字呢？是吗。。。a） 褪黑激素？b） 催产素？或 c） 甲状腺素？ Neil(尼尔)I don’t know, but I’m going to say a) melatonin.我不知道，但我要说的是 a） 褪黑激素。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called ‘Talk to me London’ has created these ‘Tubechat’ badges that you can wear to show that you’re happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one!好吧，我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。但是你知道吗，Neil，一个名为 “Talk to me London” 的组织创造了这些 “Tubechat” 徽章，你可以佩戴这些徽章来表明你很乐意与陌生人交谈。也许你应该买一个！ Neil(尼尔)Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don’t know what might happen.是的，也许我应该这样做。但问题是，大城市的人们经常害怕与陌生人开始交谈，因为你不知道会发生什么。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s true. Now, let’s listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places.这是真的。现在，让我们听听英国伯明翰城市大学的社会心理学家 Elle Boag 博士的演讲。她同意人们可以将城市视为具有威胁性的地方。 Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK(ElleBoag博士，英国伯明翰城市大学社会心理学家)When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us – we’re just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We’re persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It’s a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we’re going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other.当我们走下地铁或走上拥挤的城市街道时，我们的大脑会对周围威胁的感知变得高度警惕 —— 我们只是一大群人中的一个小人物。这会导致孤立和防御的行为。我们一直在寻找周围的潜在威胁，这使得我们不再进行眼神交流，这将降低任何人打招呼的可能性。这是一种保护机制，我们可以在前往目的地的旅程中幸存下来，这使得我们听起来对彼此都非常粗鲁。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Dr Elle Boag there. And hyper vigilance means being extremely watchful of what’s going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you’re just one person in a crowd of others and you just don’t know who might be dangerous.Elle Boag 博士在那里。高度警惕意味着要非常警惕周围发生的事情。人们的行为可能不可预测，就像 Boag 博士所说，你只是一群人中的一个人，你只是不知道谁可能是危险的。 Neil(尼尔)Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.是的，我明白你的意思。事实上，我们一直在寻找潜在的威胁，嗯，它会影响我们的行为。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become insular – which means inward looking.没错。作为一种保护机制，我们避免与他人交谈或眼神交流。因此，我们变得狭隘 – 这意味着向内看。 Neil(尼尔)It sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous – to blend in with the crowd – and not have to talk to people!听起来很糟糕！但实际上，我认识一些人搬到伦敦，是为了保持匿名 —— 融入人群 —— 而不必与人交谈！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic – which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can’t do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours.好吧，如果你在一个小镇长大，它可能会让人感到幽闭恐惧症 —— 这意味着没有足够的空间来感到舒适。你知道，如果整个社区都不知道，你就不能做任何事情。你可能有爱管闲事的邻居。 Neil(尼尔)And a nosey person shows too much interest in other people’s business.而一个爱管闲事的人对别人的事情表现出太大的兴趣。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, it’s good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it’s not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting – it’s about efficiency – getting to work on time, getting things done. Let’s hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this.现在，最好指出生活在城市的人们有事情要做。阻止人们聊天的不一定是粗鲁 —— 这是关于效率的 —— 准时上班，完成工作。让我们听听作家、广播员、礼仪专家 Thomas Farley 的意见，以了解更多信息。 Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster(ThomasFarley，作家和广播员)The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it’s a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don’t have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it’s not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose – it’s simply that people have a destination to be.城市的生活成本更高，成功商数更高，这是一个你努力生存的地方，如果你不努力，我的意思是，从字面上和比喻上讲，你无法生存和繁荣。所以我们通常没有太多时间闲聊。我认为我们都需要注意，这不是故意的无视或故意粗鲁的人 —— 这只是人们有一个目的地。 Neil(尼尔)So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?那么，凯瑟琳，托马斯·法利 （Thomas Farley） 所说的成功商数是什么意思呢？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Success quotient means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients.成功商数是指相对于普通人，你在工作中取得成功的能力，托马斯·法利 （Thomas Farley） 说，在城市里，人们的成功商数更高。 Neil(尼尔)Cities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?城市也是竞争激烈的地方，因此人们必须努力生存。我们忙碌吗，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)I don’t think we hustle, Neil. Hustle means to work aggressively to make money.我不认为我们很忙，Neil。Hustle 的意思是积极工作以赚钱。 Neil(尼尔)We do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And chitchat, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That’s what we do!不过，我们确实有足够的时间闲聊。顺便说一句，闲聊的意思是不重要的对话。这就是我们所做的！ Catherine(凯瑟琳)What we do isn’t chitchat, Neil! It’s highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today’s quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What’s the name of this chemical? Is it… a) melatonin? b) oxytocin? Or c) thyroxin?我们所做的不是闲聊，尼尔！它信息量很大，具有指导意义！现在，我认为是时候听听今天测验的答案了。你还记得吗，我问道：当我们与某人进行积极的互动时，我们的身体会释放一种化学物质。这种化学物质叫什么名字？是吗。。。a） 褪黑激素？b） 催产素？或 c） 甲状腺素？ Neil(尼尔)And it’s a) melatonin – I’m absolutely sure.它是 a） 褪黑激素 – 我绝对确定。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Sorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin – a hormone commonly known as the ‘love drug’. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment.不好意思！正确答案是 b） 催产素 – 一种通常被称为“爱情药物”的激素。它减少了恐惧，增加了人与人之间的信任，并唤起了满足感。 Neil(尼尔)Now, here are the words we learned today: hyper vigilance insular claustrophobic nosey quotient hustle chitchat现在，这是我们今天学到的单词： 高度警惕 孤立 幽闭恐惧症 爱管闲事 商数 喧嚣 闲聊 Catherine(凯瑟琳)That’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Catherine… NeilAnd I’m Neil. Do you realise, Catherine, that we are related to each other? CatherineDon’t be silly, Neil. I think I’d know if you were in my family. NeilWell, we’ll talk more about that later in the show, but I should say at this point that today we’re discussing genealogy – or the study of family history. And I think it’s pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme Who do you think you are, Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history? CatherineYeah, I’ve seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity – who was very proud of his working class London roots – or origins – discovered that he’s actually a direct descendent of an English king! NeilWell, that’s quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn’t anything exciting in your family history – no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet… CatherineWell, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there’s always something exciting or unexpected in anybody’s family history. And skeletons in the closet by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it’s time for today’s quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to decipher – or understand. So what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology? NeilWell, it must be a) Scriptography. CatherineAnd we’ll see if you’re right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity? NeilWell, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story – especially if it’s connected with our own family. And these days, it’s easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online. CatherineBBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he’s talking about his great-grandfather’s story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents! INSERTMike Williams, BBC presenter The Williamses are my father’s side and on my mother’s the Heino’s – it’s a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here – it’s a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father – the head of the household – Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family lore has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool. NeilWhat’s a census, Catherine? CatherineIt’s an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams’s great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland. NeilThe exciting event in Mike Williams’ history – passed down through family lore – which means ‘knowledge passed on from one generation to the next’ – is that his great-grandfather jumped ship. CatherineWhich means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so. NeilAnd he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories – sometimes without knowing it. CatherineActually that’s something that many people are fascinated by – and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars. NeilAnd then they come up with results saying you’re related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt… Remember I said that we were related? Well, let’s now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant. INSERTElse Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London There’s what you might call the ‘gateway ancestor’ – and the idea of history and genealogy is that’s normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known – in England it’s something like Edward III. And we’re all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that’s where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other. CatherineElse Churchill says it’s likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you’re related to Edward III is a waste of money. NeilYes, in the sense that it’s you and millions of other people. And in fact, we’re all related to each other somehow, via Edward III or someone else. CatherineAnd another popular finding for British people is to say that you’re descended from the Vikings, and again this is true for many people so it isn’t particularly meaningful. NeilIf you’re descended from a person or a group it means they are among your ancestors. CatherineNow, remember I asked: what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology? NeilI said a) Scriptography. And I’m pretty confident that’s the right answer. CatherineWell, Neil, you’re pretty confident but unfortunately it was wrong! The correct answer is b) Palaeography. Palaeography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts. NeilOh well, here are the words we learned: genealogy roots skeletons in the closet decipher census family lore descended from CatherineAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to join us again soon! BothBye! 【中英文双语脚本】Catherine(凯瑟琳)Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I’m Catherine…您好，欢迎来到 6 Minute English。我是 Catherine… Neil(尼尔)And I’m Neil. Do you realise, Catherine, that we are related to each other?我是 Neil。凯瑟琳，你意识到我们是彼此相关的吗？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Don’t be silly, Neil. I think I’d know if you were in my family.别傻了，尼尔。我想我会知道你是否在我家。 Neil(尼尔)Well, we’ll talk more about that later in the show, but I should say at this point that today we’re discussing genealogy – or the study of family history. And I think it’s pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme Who do you think you are, Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?好吧，我们将在节目后面详细讨论这个问题，但我想说的是，今天我们讨论的是家谱 —— 或者说家族史的研究。我认为这是非常有趣的东西。你有没有看过电视节目《你觉得你是谁，凯瑟琳》？你知道吗，名人在哪里了解他们的家族历史？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)Yeah, I’ve seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity – who was very proud of his working class London roots – or origins – discovered that he’s actually a direct descendent of an English king!是的，我见过几个。例如，一位名人 - 他对自己的工人阶级伦敦根源或出身感到非常自豪 - 发现他实际上是英国国王的直系后裔！ Neil(尼尔)Well, that’s quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn’t anything exciting in your family history – no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet…嗯，这真是一个了不起的发现！但问题是，凯瑟琳，如果你的家族历史中没有任何令人兴奋的事情 —— 没有谜团，壁橱里没有骷髅 —— 该怎么办…… Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there’s always something exciting or unexpected in anybody’s family history. And skeletons in the closet by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it’s time for today’s quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to decipher – or understand. So what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology?好吧，我想如果你追溯得足够远，尼尔，任何人的家族历史中总会有一些令人兴奋或意想不到的事情。顺便说一句，壁橱里的骷髅意味着秘密！现在，我认为是时候回答今天的测验问题了。研究家族史通常涉及阅读旧文件，例如出生证明、结婚证和死亡证明，这些文件可能难以破译或理解。那么，古代笔迹研究的名称是什么呢？是吗。。。a） 剧本？b） 古文字学？或者 c） 抄写学？ Neil(尼尔)Well, it must be a) Scriptography.嗯，它必须是 a） 剧本学。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And we’ll see if you’re right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity?我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。现在，你认为为什么大多数人都会查看他们的家谱，尼尔？只是好奇吗？ Neil(尼尔)Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story – especially if it’s connected with our own family. And these days, it’s easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online.好吧，凯瑟琳，我们都喜欢一个好的悬疑故事 —— 尤其是当它与我们自己的家庭有关时。如今，在线研究很容易，因为许多旧的纸质文档已经数字化并且可以在线访问。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)BBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he’s talking about his great-grandfather’s story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents!BBC 主持人迈克·威廉姆斯 （Mike Williams） 调查了他自己的家族史。在这里，他谈论的是他曾祖父的故事。如果你仔细听，你可以听到他沙沙作响的真实纸质文件！ INSERT(插入)Mike Williams, BBC presenter The Williamses are my father’s side and on my mother’s the Heino’s – it’s a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here – it’s a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father – the head of the household – Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family lore has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool.Mike Williams，BBC 主持人 Williamses 是我父亲的一方，而我母亲是 Heino 一家 —— 我们认为这个名字来自芬兰。如果我在这里看这份文件 —— 它是 1911 年英格兰和威尔士人口普查的副本 —— 你可以看到我的祖父、儿子和他的父亲 —— 一家之主 —— 迈克尔·海诺，或者米歇尔·海诺，家族传说中，他跳槽并最终来到了利物浦。 Neil(尼尔)What’s a census, Catherine?什么是人口普查，凯瑟琳？ Catherine(凯瑟琳)It’s an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams’s great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland.这是对人口的官方统计。因此，迈克·威廉姆斯的曾祖父出现在 1911 年的英格兰和威尔士人口普查中，但由于他的姓氏，家人认为他可能最初来自芬兰。 Neil(尼尔)The exciting event in Mike Williams’ history – passed down through family lore – which means ‘knowledge passed on from one generation to the next’ – is that his great-grandfather jumped ship.迈克·威廉姆斯 （Mike Williams） 历史上激动人心的事件 —— 通过家族传说流传下来 —— 意思是“知识代代相传” —— 是他的曾祖父跳槽了。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Which means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so.这意味着他在未经允许的情况下离开了他正在工作的船。 Neil(尼尔)And he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories – sometimes without knowing it.他在英国开始了新的生活。我想相当多的人在他们的家族历史中都有移民故事 —— 有时他们并不知道。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Actually that’s something that many people are fascinated by – and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars.实际上，这是许多人着迷的事情 —— 而且现在公司以低至 100 美元的价格提供测试唾液中的 DNA 也变得更容易调查。 Neil(尼尔)And then they come up with results saying you’re related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt… Remember I said that we were related? Well, let’s now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant.然后他们得出的结果说你和亚历山大大帝或布拉德皮特有关系……还记得我说过我们是亲戚吗？好吧，现在让我们听听伦敦系谱学家协会的 Else Churchill 的演讲，他解释了我的意思。 INSERT(插入)Else Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London There’s what you might call the ‘gateway ancestor’ – and the idea of history and genealogy is that’s normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known – in England it’s something like Edward III. And we’re all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that’s where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other.Else Churchill，系谱学家协会，伦敦 你可以称之为“门户祖先” —— 历史和家谱学的概念通常是有据可查的人，他们的后代是众所周知的 —— 在英国，它就像爱德华三世。我们很可能都是爱德华三世的后裔。有皇室祖先是不是很好？嗯，数以百万计的人是爱德华三世的后裔，所以从这个意义上说，这可能就是联系所在。因此，很可能很多人彼此之间有很远的联系。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Else Churchill says it’s likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you’re related to Edward III is a waste of money.埃尔斯·丘吉尔说，我们数百万人很可能与像英格兰国王爱德华三世这样的门户祖先有远亲关系。这意味着所有与爱德华三世有关的人也彼此之间有远亲关系。所以看来，付给一家公司一百美元来透露你和爱德华三世有关系是浪费钱。 Neil(尼尔)Yes, in the sense that it’s you and millions of other people. And in fact, we’re all related to each other somehow, via Edward III or someone else.是的，从某种意义上说，这是您和数百万其他人。事实上，我们都以某种方式通过爱德华三世或其他人彼此联系在一起。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And another popular finding for British people is to say that you’re descended from the Vikings, and again this is true for many people so it isn’t particularly meaningful.英国人的另一个流行发现是说你是维京人的后裔，这对许多人来说都是如此，所以这并不是特别有意义。 Neil(尼尔)If you’re descended from a person or a group it means they are among your ancestors.如果你是某个人或某个群体的后裔，那就意味着他们是你的祖先。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Now, remember I asked: what’s the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it… a) Scriptography? b) Palaeography? Or c) Scribology?现在，记得我问过：古代笔迹研究的名字是什么？是吗。。。a） 剧本？b） 古文字学？或者 c） 抄写学？ Neil(尼尔)I said a) Scriptography. And I’m pretty confident that’s the right answer.我说的是 a） 剧本学。我非常有信心这是正确的答案。 Catherine(凯瑟琳)Well, Neil, you’re pretty confident but unfortunately it was wrong! The correct answer is b) Palaeography. Palaeography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.好吧，尼尔，你很有信心，但不幸的是，你错了！正确答案是 b） 古文字学。古文字学是对古代和历史笔迹的研究，包括破译、阅读和确定历史手稿年代的实践。 Neil(尼尔)Oh well, here are the words we learned: genealogy roots skeletons in the closet decipher census family lore descended from哦，好吧，这是我们学到的单词：家谱根源 壁橱里的骨骼破译了人口普查家族传说的后代 Catherine(凯瑟琳)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

I’m Alice… NeilAnd I’m Neil. So Alice, what’s your ideal place to be? AliceCurled up on the sofa with a good book in front of a log fire. Last night it was very cold. NeilWell, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach with a cool breeze. I don’t like when it’s too hot. AliceYes, true. Humans don’t cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today’s show is extremophiles – these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake. NeilThose do sound like pretty extreme conditions. AliceYes. The thing is, what sounds hostile – or unfriendly – to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn’t survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today’s quiz question, Neil? NeilI think so. AliceAlright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to geysers – or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air – which have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon? b) Death Valley National Park? Or c) Yellowstone? NeilThat’s easy - it has to be c) Yellowstone. AliceOK, well we’ll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants? NeilNo. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren’t they? AliceYes, that’s true. But remember, extremophiles are microorganisms – they’re really tiny. Let’s listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called ‘archaea’ – meaning ‘ancient ones’. The extremophiles belong to this group. INSERTIan Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say ‘that’s all wrong – there’s really only three major groups in life: there’s the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life’; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe. NeilSo botany is the study of plant life, and zoology is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain ‘archaea’, and ‘eukaryotes’, Alice. AliceArchaea are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. Eukaryote is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell– and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi. NeilBut why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi? AliceWell, Neil, it’s likely they’ve have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable – and that’s billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today. NeilAnd when something is thriving it means it’s doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice. AliceSome live in hydrothermal vents – holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there’s lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth’s crust and then flowing out through these holes. NeilI see… Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles? AliceWell, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water. NeilAnd how do they survive down there? AliceWell, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water. NeilThat sounds clever for a microbe – how did they figure that out? AliceIt isn’t a question of cleverness - it’s a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let’s hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London. INSERTNick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals. NeilSo, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom. AliceIndeed. And now it’s time for the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone? NeilAnd I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right. AliceYes, Neil, you are right - it’s Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone’s hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth. NeilVery interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today: extremophiles hostile geysers microorganisms botany zoology archaea eukaryote thriving hydrothermal vents AliceAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

So Alice, what’s your ideal place to be?我是 Neil。那么 Alice，您理想的地方是哪里？ Alice(爱丽丝)Curled up on the sofa with a good book in front of a log fire. Last night it was very cold.蜷缩在沙发上，在柴火前放着一本好书。昨晚非常冷。 Neil(尼尔)Well, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach with a cool breeze. I don’t like when it’s too hot.嗯，对我来说，躺在热带海滩上棕榈树下的吊床上，微风拂面。我不喜欢太热的时候。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, true. Humans don’t cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today’s show is extremophiles – these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake.是的，确实如此。人类不能很好地应对极端温度，但有些物种可以。今天节目的主题是极端微生物 —— 这些微生物已经适应了生活在我们认为是极端条件下的微生物。例如，生活在接近沸腾的酸性水中或在南极湖底部结冰。 Neil(尼尔)Those do sound like pretty extreme conditions.这些听起来确实是相当极端的情况。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes. The thing is, what sounds hostile – or unfriendly – to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn’t survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today’s quiz question, Neil?是的。问题是，对我们来说听起来充满敌意或不友好的是极端微生物的完美环境，事实上，没有它们它们就无法生存。现在，尼尔，你有足够的勇气来面对今天的测验问题吗？ Neil(尼尔)I think so.我认为如此。 Alice(爱丽丝)Alright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to geysers – or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air – which have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon? b) Death Valley National Park? Or c) Yellowstone?好了，那么，这里开始了：哪个美国国家公园是间歇泉的所在地 —— 或者说是将热水和蒸汽喷射到空中的温泉 —— 里面生活着极端微生物？是吗。。。a） 大峡谷？b） 死亡谷国家公园？或者 c） 黄石公园？ Neil(尼尔)That’s easy - it has to be c) Yellowstone.这很简单 - 必须是 c） 黄石公园。 Alice(爱丽丝)OK, well we’ll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants?好的，我们会在节目的后面看看你是否得到了正确的答案。但是，继续说下去，现在，尼尔，你知道极端微生物与其他动物和植物属于完全不同的生物群吗？ Neil(尼尔)No. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren’t they?不。我想象极端微生物会像昆虫一样，因为昆虫很坚韧，不是吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, that’s true. But remember, extremophiles are microorganisms – they’re really tiny. Let’s listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called ‘archaea’ – meaning ‘ancient ones’. The extremophiles belong to this group.是的，这是真的。但请记住，极端微生物是微生物 —— 它们真的很小。让我们听听伦敦伯贝克大学行星科学和天体生物学教授伊恩·克劳福德 （Ian Crawford） 的演讲。他告诉我们，在 1970 年代，一位名叫 Carl Woese 的科学家如何确定了一个新的生物王国，他称之为“古细菌” —— 意思是“古老的”。极端微生物属于这一组。 INSERT(插入)Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say ‘that’s all wrong – there’s really only three major groups in life: there’s the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life’; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe.伊恩·克劳福德（Ian Crawford），伦敦伯贝克大学行星科学和天体生物学教授嗯，古老的生命之树概念基本上是关于帝国，如果你愿意的话，植物、动物，以及我们可以看到的事物。我们非常重视大型生物以及植物学和动物学在生物学中的传统区别。它真正做的是说“这都是错误的 —— 生命中实际上只有三个主要群体：古细菌、细菌和真核生物，它们就是所有这些复杂的生命”；所以它有点把人类放在生命之树的一个小角落里，旁边是植物和其他任何东西。在成为宇宙的中心之后，它又一次压制了我们。 Neil(尼尔)So botany is the study of plant life, and zoology is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain ‘archaea’, and ‘eukaryotes’, Alice.所以植物学是对植物生命的研究，而动物学是对动物生命的研究。但也许你可以解释“古细菌”和“真核生物”，爱丽丝。 Alice(爱丽丝)Archaea are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. Eukaryote is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell– and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi.古细菌是一组单细胞微生物，类似于细菌，但与所有其他已知类型不同。真核生物是具有更大、更复杂的细胞类型的生物的科学术语 —— 该组包括所有动物、植物和真菌。 Neil(尼尔)But why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi?但为什么古细菌如此重要呢？为什么他们需要属于自己的整个生物领域，而我们人类却被植物和真菌挤在一个领域？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, Neil, it’s likely they’ve have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable – and that’s billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today.嗯，尼尔，自从地球变得宜居以来，它们很可能就一直生活在我们的星球上 —— 那是数十亿年。今天，它们仍然在各种不同的环境中生活和繁荣。 Neil(尼尔)And when something is thriving it means it’s doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice.当某样东西蓬勃发展时，意味着它做得很好！那么，告诉我们他们住在哪里，Alice。 Alice(爱丽丝)Some live in hydrothermal vents – holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there’s lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth’s crust and then flowing out through these holes.有些生活在热液喷口中，即海底数百米深的洞，那里有很大的压力，没有阳光。富含矿物质的过热水从地壳中流出，然后通过这些空洞流出。 Neil(尼尔)I see… Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles?明白了。。。那么，爱寒的极端微生物呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water.嗯，科学家们在南极洲数百米厚的冰盖下的隐藏湖泊中发现了它们。钻穿冰层到达水面需要几天时间。 Neil(尼尔)And how do they survive down there?他们又是如何在那儿生存的呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water.嗯，这些微生物已经找到了一种从水中的某些矿物质（如铁和硫）中获取能量的方法。 Neil(尼尔)That sounds clever for a microbe – how did they figure that out?对于微生物来说，这听起来很聪明 —— 他们是怎么弄清楚的呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)It isn’t a question of cleverness - it’s a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let’s hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London.这不是一个聪明的问题 —— 这是一个适应的问题。极端微生物对环境的适应能力极强，它们比更复杂的生命形式更早出现在地球上。让我们听听伦敦大学学院进化生物化学读者 Nick Lane 的演讲。 INSERT(插入)Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals.Nick Lane，伦敦大学学院进化生物化学读者真核细胞的起源，似乎发生过一次，大约花了 20 亿年才发生。然后，在细胞水平上出现了巨大的飞跃，但又过了十亿年，我们才看到动物。 Neil(尼尔)So, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom.所以，基本上，动物界比古宙界要新得多。 Alice(爱丽丝)Indeed. And now it’s time for the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone?事实上。现在是回答今天测验问题的时候了，Neil。我问：美国哪个国家公园是间歇泉的所在地，其中生活着极端微生物？是吗。。。a） 大峡谷，b） 死亡谷国家公园还是 c） 黄石公园？ Neil(尼尔)And I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right.我说 c） 黄石公园。我一定是对的。 Alice(爱丽丝)Yes, Neil, you are right - it’s Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone’s hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth.是的，Neil，你说得对 - 这是黄石国家公园。每年，科学家们都会在黄石公园的温泉中发现非凡的新微生物，对医学、农业和能源产生影响，并为地球上最早生命的形成提供线索。 Neil(尼尔)Very interesting.

AliceWell, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel. NeilI’ve never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes. AliceWell, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to. And they’re hungry for characters a little closer to home – or relevant to their own lives. NeilSo what’s Ms Marvel’s super power? AliceShe’s a shape shifter – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she’s also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim. NeilIt sounds good. But I think it must be time for today’s quiz question, Alice! AliceOK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster? NeilI’m going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man. AliceWell, we’ll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both contaminated – or poisoned – by radioactive substances that change their DNA. NeilWhat about Batman and Iron Man? They’re just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves. AliceGood point. There don’t seem to be any hard-and-fast – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it’s being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books. NeilThat’s true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often blur the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me. AliceLet’s hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London. INSERTJason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to. NeilSo publishers – like Marvel Comics – imbued – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can’t imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife! AliceAnd bickering means arguing about things that aren’t important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse – or varied – readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home. NeilI know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they’ve been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing. AliceWell, it isn’t. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the manga – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there. NeilReally? AliceYes. Let’s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga. INSERTDr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it’s one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority. NeilDr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK. AliceIt’s particularly interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan. NeilAnd do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman? AliceNo. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let’s go to today’s quiz question. I asked you: what’s the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster? NeilAnd I said Miles Morales. AliceAnd you were… wrong, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor’s hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel. NeilVery interesting. Now, let’s remind ourselves of the words we learned today: closer to home shape shifter contaminated hard and fast blur imbued bicker diverse manga autonomous AliceAnd that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

So Neil, the subject of today’s show is superheroes! Who’s your favourite?我是 Alice。所以 Neil，今天节目的主题是超级英雄！你最喜欢谁？ Neil(尼尔)Spiderman. He’s cool and funny – and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers!蜘蛛侠。他很酷，很有趣 —— 他可以织网和从摩天大楼上跳下来！ Alice(爱丽丝)Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel.嗯，我最喜欢的超级英雄是惊奇女士。 Neil(尼尔)I’ve never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.我从来没有听说过她 —— 而且我有点像漫画超级英雄方面的专家。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to. And they’re hungry for characters a little closer to home – or relevant to their own lives.好吧，越来越多的来自不同种族背景的人对所有这些他们无法与之产生共鸣的白人男性超级英雄感到厌倦。他们渴望更贴近家庭或与他们自己的生活相关的角色。 Neil(尼尔)So what’s Ms Marvel’s super power?那么惊奇女士的超能力是什么呢？ Alice(爱丽丝)She’s a shape shifter – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she’s also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.她是一个变形者 —— 这意味着她可以改变形状并成为她想要的任何东西。但她也只是卡玛拉·汗（Kamala Khan），一个来自新泽西州的普通青少年，恰好是亚裔和穆斯林。 Neil(尼尔)It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today’s quiz question, Alice!听起来不错。但我认为今天一定是问答问题的时候了，Alice！ Alice(爱丽丝)OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster?好，就在这里。取代托尼·斯塔克饰演钢铁侠的新角色叫什么名字？是吗。。。a） 迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯？b） 里里·威廉姆斯？或者 c） 简·福斯特？ Neil(尼尔)I’m going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.我要说 a） 迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯，因为他听起来像个男人。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, we’ll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both contaminated – or poisoned – by radioactive substances that change their DNA.好吧，我们稍后会在节目中发现您是否回答正确。现在，我有另一个问题。获得超级英雄地位的规则是什么？超人是外星人，惊奇女士有外星基因，蜘蛛侠和绿巨人都被改变 DNA 的放射性物质污染或中毒。 Neil(尼尔)What about Batman and Iron Man? They’re just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.蝙蝠侠和钢铁侠呢？他们只是拥有大量金钱的普通人，利用技术为自己创造超能力。 Alice(爱丽丝)Good point. There don’t seem to be any hard-and-fast – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it’s being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books.说得好。似乎没有任何硬性规定或明确的规定。但这些特殊能力 —— 无论是能够飞行、改变形状还是织网 —— 它们都让角色在世界上做好事。这是所有漫画书的一个大主题。 Neil(尼尔)That’s true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often blur the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.这是真的。但时代变了，如今的漫画书经常模糊对与错的界限 —— 让事情变得不清楚。超级英雄并不总是做正确的事情，像你我一样与日常问题作斗争。 Alice(爱丽丝)Let’s hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London.让我们从伦敦大学学院政治地理学教授 Jason Ditmer 那里更多地了解不完美的超级英雄。 INSERT(插入)Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to.杰森·迪特默（Jason Ditmer），伦敦大学学院政治地理学教授他们 [漫威漫画] 为这些角色注入了真实的人类问题。所以彼得·帕克刚刚，有点……一个接一个的问题。神奇四侠是一个家庭，他们争吵和打架，里德和苏是一对，然后他们结婚了，这在超级英雄漫画中从来没有发生过。所以这些人的生活让其他人可以感同身受。 Neil(尼尔)So publishers – like Marvel Comics – imbued – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can’t imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife!因此，出版商 —— 比如漫威漫画 —— 将人性问题灌输或填充到他们的角色中。我无法想象像美国队长这样的角色会为小事担心 —— 或者和他的妻子争吵！ Alice(爱丽丝)And bickering means arguing about things that aren’t important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse – or varied – readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home.而争吵意味着为不重要的事情争论。嗯，就像你之前说的，时代在变化，Neil。如今，出版社希望吸引更多样化或多样化的读者群：青少年、女性、少数民族 —— 他们希望有与自己产生共鸣的超级英雄，面临从种族歧视到家庭争吵等问题。 Neil(尼尔)I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they’ve been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.我知道女性确实对超级英雄感兴趣，因为她们一直出现在电影和电视上，但漫画书的世界一直有点像男人。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, it isn’t. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the manga – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there.嗯，不是。女性阅读它们，在某些地方，女性在其中工作。例如，在日本，我们有漫画 —— 这些是成人和儿童的日本漫画书。而且，你猜怎么着 —— 那里有很强的女性插画家传统。 Neil(尼尔)Really?真？ Alice(爱丽丝)Yes. Let’s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.是的。现在让我们继续前进，听听伦敦城市大学（City University）的社会学家凯西·布里恩扎（Casey Brienza）博士谈论漫画。 INSERT(插入)Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it’s one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority.Casey Brienza 博士，伦敦城市大学社会学家在日本制作漫画真正有趣的事情之一是，它是女性可以拥有的少数自主职业之一。因此，日本有很多很多女性漫画家，她们为男性、女性、男孩和女孩写作。在美国和英国，女性漫画家无疑是少数。 Neil(尼尔)Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.Casey Brienza 博士在那里。所以她说，女性漫画家在日本很常见，但在美国和英国却是少数。 Alice(爱丽丝)It’s particularly interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan.特别有趣的是，成为一名艺术家是一个自主的职业–这意味着你可以自由地做出自己的决定–显然，这对日本女性来说并不常见。 Neil(尼尔)And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?你知道谁画了惊奇女士吗？是女性吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let’s go to today’s quiz question. I asked you: what’s the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it… a) Miles Morales? b) Riri Williams? Or c) Jane Foster?不。惊奇女士是由一个男人绘制的 —— 加拿大漫画家阿德里安·阿尔方纳 （Adrian Alphona）。但是我们的时间不多了，所以让我们来看看今天的测验问题。我问你：取代托尼·斯塔克饰演钢铁侠的新角色叫什么名字？是吗。。。a） 迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯？b） 里里·威廉姆斯？或者 c） 简·福斯特？ Neil(尼尔)And I said Miles Morales.我说的是迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯。 Alice(爱丽丝)And you were… wrong, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor’s hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel.而你是……错了，尼尔。对不起。答案是 Riri Williams。漫威漫画最近对其角色进行了多样化，使其看起来更像我们今天所知道的世界，包括增加非裔美国女大学生瑞里·威廉姆斯 （Riri Williams） 饰演钢铁侠。漫威还将雷神的锤子给了一位女性，介绍了一位名叫迈尔斯·莫拉莱斯 （Miles Morales） 的西班牙裔黑人蜘蛛侠，并创造了穆斯林超级英雄卡玛拉·汗 （Kamala Khan），也被称为惊奇女士。 Neil(尼尔)Very interesting.

NeilAnd navigate means’ to find the way to get to a place’. I’m not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.

Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road. AliceThey are being irresponsible drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today’s show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300? b) 3,000? Or c) 30,000? NeilAnd I’m going to say b) 3,000. AliceWell, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil? NeilNo, I’m not a petrol head – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He’ll answer this question himself. Let’s listen. INSERTEddie Jordan, racing team owner When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I’m now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn’t want to drive and I always felt cheated because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience. NeilEddie Jordan there. And doing something flat out means ‘at maximum capacity’. Do you feel like a different person when you’re driving, Alice? AliceNo. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I’d love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn’t feel cheated of the pleasure of driving! NeilI agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I’m a bit of a backseat driver. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice. AliceWell just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn’t need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely. NeilBut can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions? AliceOverride in this context means ‘to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself’. Airline pilots do that, don’t they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing. NeilI would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to. AliceWell, let’s listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who’s experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained. INSERTBrian Fung, technology reporter Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable. And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that’s one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it’s how mundane it was. NeilBrian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and right off the bat means ‘immediately’. AliceBut he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars. NeilWell, that all sounds very nice, but I think I’d still prefer to be in the driving seat – and that means ‘in control of a situation’. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice. AliceWell, the future is likely to be all about automated transport – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won’t have a choice, Neil. NeilMaybe you’ll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun. AliceMaybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads. NeilI still need some convincing. And that brings us back to today’s quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice? AliceOf course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000? NeilAnd I said 3,000. AliceAnd unfortunately Neil that’s right! Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. That’s according to Annual Global Road Crash Statistics.

What do you think about autonomous cars, Alice?我是 Neil。爱丽丝，你觉得自动驾驶汽车怎么样？ Alice(爱丽丝)An autonomous – or independent and driverless – car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. I think they’re a great idea.自动驾驶或独立无人驾驶汽车是指能够在无需人工输入的情况下感知环境并导航的车辆。我认为他们是个好主意。 Neil(尼尔)And navigate means’ to find the way to get to a place’. I’m not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.导航的意思是“找到到达某个地方的路”。我不确定我是否会相信计算机会驱动我。它可能会出错并撞到墙上。 Alice(爱丽丝)Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error, and human error means ‘the mistakes we make because we’re human’. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk – or distracted.也许吧，但实际上大多数车祸都涉及人为错误的因素，而人为错误是指“因为我们是人而犯的错误”。例如，在疲倦或醉酒或分心时开车的人。 Neil(尼尔)Behind the wheel: in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road.在方向盘后面：换句话说，控制一辆汽车。是的，我经常看到人们用手机或短信聊天，而不是看路。 Alice(爱丽丝)They are being irresponsible drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today’s show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300? b) 3,000? Or c) 30,000?他们是不负责任的司机，尼尔。驾驶是今天节目的主题。我有一个问题要问你。平均而言，全世界每天有多少人死于道路事故？是吗。。。a） 300 个？b） 3,000 人？或者 c） 30,000 人？ Neil(尼尔)And I’m going to say b) 3,000.我要说 b） 3,000。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, we’ll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil?好吧，我们稍后会在节目中看看你是对还是错。你是汽油迷吗，尼尔？ Neil(尼尔)No, I’m not a petrol head – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He’ll answer this question himself. Let’s listen.不，我不是一个汽油迷 —— 我是一个热爱汽车和驾驶的人。但我知道赛车队老板 Eddie Jordan 是。他喜欢开车的什么地方？他会自己回答这个问题。让我们倾听。 INSERT(插入)Eddie Jordan, racing team owner When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I’m now in control.

So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience.Eddie Jordan，赛车队老板当我坐上一辆车时，我感觉自己变了一个人，我觉得我现在掌控一切。我可以打开音乐，也可以关闭它。我可以做各种我感觉良好的不同事情。当我在 Jordan 团队全力以赴时，我确实有一名车手，他能够打电话、接电话、能够在车里工作，不是因为我不想开车，我总是觉得被骗了，因为那里有一位车手享受了我本应拥有的乐趣。所以当我坐上车时，它必须是一次有趣的经历。 Neil(尼尔)Eddie Jordan there. And doing something flat out means ‘at maximum capacity’. Do you feel like a different person when you’re driving, Alice?埃迪乔丹在那里。全力以赴意味着“以最大容量”。爱丽丝，当你开车时，你觉得自己变了一个人吗？ Alice(爱丽丝)No. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I’d love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn’t feel cheated of the pleasure of driving!不。而且 —— 与 Eddie Jordan 不同 —— 就此而言，我很想拥有一辆司机或无人驾驶汽车。它让你有时间做其他事情，比如完成一些工作。我当然不会觉得被驾驶的乐趣所欺骗！ Neil(尼尔)I agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I’m a bit of a backseat driver. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.我同意 Eddie Jordan 的观点。我会觉得有点被骗了。我不得不承认：我有点像后座司机。我坐在副驾驶座上，给司机一些不需要的建议。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn’t need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.好吧，Neil，想想看，在无人驾驶汽车中，你不需要给计算机建议，因为它会做出正确的决定，让你安全地到达目的地。 Neil(尼尔)But can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions?但是你能覆盖计算机吗？你知道，如果你觉得它做出了错误的决定？ Alice(爱丽丝)Override in this context means ‘to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself’. Airline pilots do that, don’t they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing.在此上下文中，Override 的意思是 “通过自己控制来停止自动作”。航空公司的飞行员就是这样做的，不是吗？他们在大部分旅程中都以自动驾驶仪飞行，但为了控制飞机的起飞和降落，他们超越了自动驾驶仪。 Neil(尼尔)I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.如果我愿意，如果我能收回对自动驾驶汽车的控制权，我会感到更快乐。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, let’s listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who’s experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained.好吧，现在让我们听听科技记者 Brian Fung 的演讲，他体验了在无人驾驶汽车中的感觉，没有方向盘、没有制动踏板、没有紧急制动、没有换档器。谷歌正在开发一款汽车，其中一切都将是独立的。 INSERT(插入)Brian Fung, technology reporter Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable.

And I think that’s one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it’s how mundane it was.Brian Fung，科技记者 嗯，你马上注意到的最重要的事情是，这辆车的加速可能比普通汽车更激进一点，刹车也比普通汽车更激进一点，但除此之外，你需要大约 10 秒才能适应。而且这辆车知道如何在红灯时停下来；它知道如何闯黄灯，可以检测行人并在停放的汽车周围导航。总而言之，感觉与普通的汽车驾驶体验非常相似。我认为这是它最令人惊讶和令人兴奋的事情之一 —— 它是多么平凡。 Neil(尼尔)Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and right off the bat means ‘immediately’.Brian Fung 说，他立即注意到 Google 汽车的加速和制动比普通汽车更激进 —— 马上就意味着“立即”。 Alice(爱丽丝)But he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars.但他也表示，他只花了 10 秒钟就适应了它并感到舒适，因为汽车可以适当地导航并响应不同的交通情况，包括行人和停放的汽车。 Neil(尼尔)Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I’d still prefer to be in the driving seat – and that means ‘in control of a situation’. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice.嗯，这听起来很不错，但我想我仍然更喜欢坐在驾驶座上 —— 这意味着“掌控局势”。你可以坐那辆无人驾驶的车，去做你的工作吧，爱丽丝。 Alice(爱丽丝)Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won’t have a choice, Neil.好吧，未来很可能都是关于自动化运输的 - 飞机、火车、公共汽车和汽车 - 你根本别无选择，Neil。 Neil(尼尔)Maybe you’ll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun.也许你会被允许租一辆可以自己驾驶的汽车，只是为了好玩。 Alice(爱丽丝)Maybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads.或。但我喜欢未来拥有安全无人驾驶道路的想法。 Neil(尼尔)I still need some convincing. And that brings us back to today’s quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice?我还需要一些说服力。这让我们回到了今天的测验问题。现在，您能告诉我们答案吗，爱丽丝？ Alice(爱丽丝)Of course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000?我当然可以！我问道：平均而言，全世界每天大约有多少人死于交通事故？是吗。。。a） 300，b） 3,000 还是 c） 30,000？ Neil(尼尔)And I said 3,000.我说 3,000 人。 Alice(爱丽丝)And unfortunately Neil that’s right! Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. That’s according to Annual Global Road Crash Statistics.不幸的是，尼尔，没错！每年有近 130 万人死于道路交通事故，平均每天有 3,287 人死亡。这是根据年度全球道路交通事故统计数据得出的。 Neil(尼尔)Now, here are the words we learned today: autonomous navigate human error behind the wheel petrol head flat out backseat driver override right off the bat in the driving seat现在，以下是我们今天学到的单词： 自主导航 方向盘后面的人为错误 汽油头 后座驾驶员立即在驾驶座上超控 Alice(爱丽丝)And that’s the end of today’s 6 Minute English.
